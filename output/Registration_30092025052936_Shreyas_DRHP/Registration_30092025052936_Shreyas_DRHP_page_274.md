## 6 Impairment of Assets

The Company periodically assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and if such recoverable of the asset is less than carrying cost of the asset, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The deduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in profit and loss account.

If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to maximum of depreciable historical cost. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of asset does not exceed the net book value that would have been determined; if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Due consideration is given at the balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of the company's assets as defined in Accounting Standard 28 – "Impairment of Assets" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the management is of the opinion that none of the property, plant and equipment were impaired as at the date of the Balance sheet.

## 7 Inventories

Raw materials are carried at cost. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. Purchased goods-in-transit are carried at cost. Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Stores and spare parts are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Finished goods produced or purchased by the Company are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct material and labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.

When there has been a decline in the price of materials and it is estimated that the cost of the finished products will exceed net realisable value, the Raw materials are written down to net realisable value. In such circumstances, the replacement cost of the materials may be the best available measure of their net realisable value.
