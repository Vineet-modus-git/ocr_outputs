Hot-Dip Galvanized Components and Sub-Assemblies"}, {"bbox": [154, 830, 1499, 991], "category": "Text", "text": "Our Hot Dip Galvanized (HDG) product line includes a range of mild steel components designed for outdoor and industrial installations where corrosion resistance and mechanical strength are critical. These components are treated using the hot dip galvanizing process, which involves coating fabricated steel in molten zinc to form a robust, weather-resistant layer. They are primarily used as supporting structures or protective housings in larger electrical, telecom, and infrastructure systems. The following are the key components manufactured and their functional roles:"}, {"bbox": [154, 1022, 1499, 1655], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Telecom Mounting Brackets:** Telecom mounting brackets are heavy-duty steel fixtures fabricated from mild steel and treated through a hot-dip galvanizing process to provide long-term corrosion protection. These brackets are designed to securely anchor antennas, microwave dishes, and radio units onto vertical or horizontal members of telecom towers or monopoles. They are commonly used in both greenfield and rooftop telecom sites to ensure precise alignment and load stability. Their galvanized coating significantly extends service life in outdoor environments, especially under continuous exposure to heat, humidity, and rain.\n* **Cable Support Trays:** Cable support trays are structural assemblies formed from galvanized steel sheets and fabricated into ladder or perforated designs to support and route electrical and communication cables. These are deployed across telecom towers, industrial plants, and infrastructure corridors to enable structured cable layout, reduce cable sag, and prevent abrasion or accidental damage. The HDG finish protects the trays from rusting and enhances load-bearing capacity, making them suitable for prolonged use in harsh or open-air conditions.\n* **Tower Cross Arms:** Tower cross arms are horizontal load-bearing components mounted at designated elevations on lattice or monopole towers. These components are used to hold antennas, radio units, or tensioned cables at defined separations to avoid signal interference or structural overlap. In some instances, they also support electrical insulators or guy wires. Manufactured using galvanized steel for strength and environmental durability, these cross arms provide optimal spacing, ensure mechanical balance, and support efficient network performance under wind and structural stress."}, {"bbox": [160, 1735, 632, 2016], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [238, 2064, 559, 2096], "category": "Caption", "text": "Telecom Mounting Bracket"}, {"bbox": [642, 1735, 1116, 2016], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [760, 2064, 999, 2096], "category": "Caption", "text": "Cable Support Trays"}, {"bbox": [1142, 1702, 1474, 2047], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1207, 2064, 1412, 2096], "category": "Caption", "text": "Tower Cross Arm"}, {"bbox": [154, 2136, 1029, 2169], "category": "Text", "text": "Representative illustration depicting end-use systems in their assembled form:"}]
