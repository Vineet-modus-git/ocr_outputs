The Board of Directors of the respective companies are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process in
respect of preparation of the Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's Report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements. As
part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

* Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

* Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.

* Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management and Board of Directors.

* Conclude on the appropriateness of management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Shreyas Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditors' Report to the related disclosures in the Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Shreyas Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

* Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements including the disclosures, and whether the Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and Issuer regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.
