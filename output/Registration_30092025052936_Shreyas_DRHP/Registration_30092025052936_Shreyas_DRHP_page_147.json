These components are engineered to provide mechanical stability, withstand environmental stresses, and facilitate panel alignment for energy efficiency. Our products cater to both fixed and rotating solar installations and are supplied to EPC contractors and system integrators engaged in renewable energy projects."}, {"bbox": [153, 892, 1500, 1350], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Fixed Panel Frames:** These are rigid steel frames designed to hold solar panels in a stationary position at a pre-defined tilt angle. They are primarily used in rooftop or ground-mounted systems where sun-tracking is not employed. The frames are engineered for structural strength, corrosion resistance, and long-term outdoor exposure, ensuring the panels remain securely mounted under wind and load conditions.\n* **Pivoting Base Assemblies:** These are fabricated steel bases that serve as anchoring and rotation points in sun-tracking systems. They allow for controlled movement of solar panels, enabling the panels to follow the sun's trajectory throughout the day. This enhances solar exposure and improves energy generation. The assemblies are designed for mechanical precision and weather durability and are typically installed in utility-scale or high-efficiency solar fields.\n* **Alignment and Tilt Mechanisms:** These components assist in adjusting the orientation and tilt of solar panels during installation or for seasonal optimization. They are integrated into the mounting structure to support efficient positioning and structural integrity. Proper alignment improves panel output while reducing stress on mounting joints, contributing to the system's overall lifespan."}, {"bbox": [620, 1384, 1032, 1739], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [711, 1757, 940, 1792], "category": "Caption", "text": "Solar Panel Mounts"}, {"bbox": [153, 1834, 1032, 1870], "category": "Text", "text": "*Representative illustration depicting end-use systems in their assembled form:*"}]
