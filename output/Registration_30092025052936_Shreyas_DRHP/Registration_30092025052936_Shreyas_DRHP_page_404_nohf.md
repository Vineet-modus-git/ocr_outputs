The price discovery is a function of demand at various prices. The highest price at which the Issuer is able to Offer the desired number of Equity Shares is the price at which the book cuts off, i.e., ₹22.00 in the above example. The Issuer, in consultation with the Book Running Lead Manager, may finalise the Offer Price at or below such Cut-Off Price, i.e., at or below ₹22.00. All Bids at or above this Offer Price and cut-off Bids are valid Bids and are considered for allocation in the respective categories.
