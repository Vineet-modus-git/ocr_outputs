Company may deploy certain amounts towards any of the above-mentioned Objects through a combination of Internal Accruals or Borrowings.

## Details of the Object

### 1) Capital Expenditure towards purchase of Machinery

Our Company is engaged in the production of precision-engineered components that serve structural and mechanical functions across industrial and infrastructure applications. Our product range includes hot-dip galvanized steel assemblies, aluminium fabrication parts, diesel engine sub-assemblies, deep drawn parts for pneumatic and control systems, weighbridges, and solar panel mounts. Details of our offerings can be found in the chapter titled "Our Business" on page no. 137.

Currently We operate two manufacturing units in Nashik, Maharashtra. Our Plant I is located in the MIDC Ambad industrial zone, while Plant II is situated on Dindori Road, approximately 25 km from Nashik city. Each plant is equipped with heavy-duty overhead cranes (5 - 10 tonne capacity) and a centralized tool room for in-house development of stamping dies, jigs, and fixtures. Our manufacturing infrastructure is designed to support precision fabrication of components with complex geometries and tight dimensional tolerances. We use automated equipment such as robotic welding systems, CNC laser cutters, and plasma cutting machines to manufacture structurally complex and dimensionally accurate components. These tools enable us to handle varied material thicknesses and intricate geometries with consistency and efficiency. In support of long-term sustainability and operational cost control, we have installed solar power generation panels in February 2025 that contributes to our captive energy needs.

The company is currently running at its capacity of approx. 26.62% (Annualised) where the focus on production is towards precision-engineered components. To scale the production and meet market demand, the company would need to invest in new machineries. We plan to significantly improve and expand our production mechanism which requires installation of certain machineries whose details are mentioned below.

To address the increasing demand in the steel industry as mentioned under chapter titled "Our Industry" on page 120 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we are taking steps to significantly expand our production. This expansion involves the installation of 7 additional machines. As part of this strategic investment, we anticipate incurring significant expenditure, amounting to ₹ 266.09 Lakhs, which will be funded from the net proceeds of the offer. This investment in Plant & Machinery will substantially augment our current production capabilities, allowing us to meet the increasing demand from the market. Through this expansion, we aim to strengthen our market position and further capitalize on the growing opportunities within the structural steel sector.

The addition of these machines will improve production efficiency by reduction in processing costs and lead times, enhancing our operational efficiency and enabling us to scale production to its full capacity. Furthermore, the automation introduced in the machinery will help lower labour costs. This expansion is expected to lead to increased sales volume and overall profitability.

The details of machineries to be acquired are listed below:

**1. Fiber Laser Cutting Machine 12kW (DigiCut DLL2064):**

The 12kW fiber laser cutting machine performs the same functions as the 6kW model, with added capacity to handle thicker materials and operate at higher cutting speeds. Together, the two machines provide flexibility across different material thicknesses and production volumes, thereby strengthening the Company's overall fabrication capabilities.

**2. Press Brake Machine (Amada HRB2204):**

This press brake machine is intended for precision bending and forming of sheet metal components. It converts flat-cut blanks into shapes such as angles, channels, and enclosures with high dimensional accuracy, ensuring consistent part quality and supporting efficient downstream assembly.

**3. CNC Press Brake Machine (Efficient Series EM CNC PBE 1641):**

The CNC press brake carries out the same bending and forming functions but with computer numerical control. Stored programs allow bend sequences to be executed with high repeatability, reducing manual intervention and enhancing efficiency in multi-step or complex operations. This complements the conventional press brake by improving throughput in sheet metal fabrication.
