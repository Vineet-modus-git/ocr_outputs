Being a signatory to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, India is required to recognize product patents as well as process patents. In addition to the broad requirement that an invention satisfy the requirements of novelty, utility and non-obviousness in order for it to avail patent protection, the Patents Act further provides that patent protection may not be granted to certain specified types of inventions and materials even if they satisfy the above criteria. Section 39 of the Patents Act also prohibits any person resident in India from applying for a patent for an invention outside India without making an application for a patent for the same invention in India. The term of a patent granted under the Patents Act pursuant to Section 53 is for a period of twenty years from the date of filing of the application for the patent. A patent shall cease to have effect if the renewal fee is not paid within the period prescribed for the payment of such renewal fee. While the Patents Act prohibits patentability of a 'computer programme' as such, computer programmes in combination with novel hardware could be considered patentable depending on the substance of the invention and applicable provisions of the Patents Act. Computer programmes on their own are excluded from patent protection and are protected as a literary work under the Copyright Laws.
