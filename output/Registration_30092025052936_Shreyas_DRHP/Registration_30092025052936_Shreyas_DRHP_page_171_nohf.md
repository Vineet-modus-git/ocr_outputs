## TAX RELATED LEGISLATIONS

### Income Tax Act, 1961 ("IT Act")

The IT Act is applicable to every company, whether domestic or foreign whose income is taxable under the provisions of the IT Act or Rules made thereunder depending upon its residential status and type of income involved. The IT Act provides for the taxation of persons resident in India on global income and persons not resident in India on income received, accruing or arising in India or deemed to have been received, accrued or arising in India. Every company assessable to income tax under the IT Act is required to comply with the provisions thereof, including those relating to tax deduction at source, advance tax, minimum alternative tax and like. Every such company is also required to file its returns by September 30 of each assessment year.

### Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (the "CGST Act")

The CGST Act levies indirect tax throughout India to replace many taxes levied by the Central and State Governments. The CGST Act was applicable from July 1, 2017 and combined the Central Excise Duty, Commercial Tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), Food Tax, Central Sales Tax (CST), Introit, Octroi, Entertainment Tax, Entry Tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury Tax, Advertisement Tax, Service Tax, Customs Duty, Surcharges. CGST is levied on all transactions such as sale, transfer, purchase, barter, lease, or import of goods and/or services. India has adopted a dual GST model, meaning that taxation is administered by both the Union and State Governments. Transactions made within a single state is levied with Central GST (CGST) by the Central Government and State GST (SGST) by the government of that state. For inter-state transactions and imported goods or services, an Integrated GST (IGST) is levied by the Central Government. GST is a consumption-based tax; therefore, taxes are paid to the state where the goods or services are consumed and not the state in which they were produced.

## Environment Laws

### The Environment Protection Act, 1986 and Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986

The Environment Protection Act, 1986 (the "Act") is an "umbrella" legislation designed to provide a framework for coordination of the activities of various Central and State authorities established under various laws. The potential scope of the Act is broad, with "environment" defined to include water, air and land and the interrelationships which exist among water, air and land, and human beings and other living creatures such as plants, micro-organisms and property. Further, the Ministry of Environment and Forests looks into Environment Impact Assessment. The Ministry receives proposals for expansion, modernization and setting up of projects and the impact which such projects would have on the environment which is assessed by the Ministry in detail before granting clearances for such proposed projects.

### National Environmental Policy, 2006

This National Environmental Policy, 2006 ("Policy") seeks to extend the coverage, and fill in gaps that still exist, in light of present knowledge and accumulated experience. This Policy was prepared through an intensive process of consultation within the Government and inputs from experts. It does not displace, but builds on the earlier policies. It is a statement of India's commitment to making a positive contribution to international efforts. This is a response to our national commitment to a clean environment, mandated in the Constitution in Articles 48 A and 51 A (g), strengthened by judicial interpretation of Article 21. The dominant theme of this Policy is that while conservation of environmental resources is necessary to secure livelihoods and well-being of all, the most secure basis for conservation is to ensure that people dependent on particular resources obtain better livelihoods from the fact of conservation, than from degradation of the resource. Following are the objectives of the National Environmental Policy:

1. Conservation of Critical Environmental Resources

2. Intra-generational Equity: Livelihood Security for the Poor

3. Inter-generational Equity
