# SECTION III: RISK FACTORS

An investment in our Equity Shares involves a high degree of financial risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider all the information in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus, particularly the "Financial Information of the Company" and the related notes, "Our Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on page 207, 137 and 208 respectively of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus and the risks and uncertainties described below, before making a decision to invest in our Equity Shares.

This Draft Red Herring Prospectus also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We have described the risks and uncertainties that our management believes are material, but these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those we are not aware of or deem immaterial, may also result in decreased revenues, increased expenses or other events that could result in a decline in the value of our Equity Shares. In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of our Company and the Issue, including the merits and risks involved. Unless specified or quantified in the relevant risk factors below, we are not in a position to quantify the financial or other implications of any of the risks described in this section. Investors are advised to read the risk factors carefully before taking an investment decision in this Issue. Investors should not invest in this Issue unless they are prepared to accept the risk of losing all or part of their investment, and they should consult their tax, financial and legal advisors about the particular consequences to you of an investment in the Equity Shares.

Unless otherwise stated in the relevant risk factors set forth below, we are not in a position to specify or quantify the financial or other implications of any of the risks mentioned herein. Unless otherwise stated, the financial information of our Company used in this section is derived from our restated financial statements prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP and the Companies Act and restated in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations. To obtain a better understanding, you should read this section in conjunction with the chapters titled "Our Business" beginning on page 137, "Our Industry" beginning on page 112 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" beginning on page 208 respectively, of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus as well as other financial information contained herein.

The following factors have been considered for determining the materiality of Risk Factors:

1. Some events may not be material individually but may be found material collectively;

2. Some events may have material impact qualitatively instead of quantitatively;

3. Some events may not be material at present but may have material impact in future.

The financial and other related implications of risks concerned, wherever quantifiable, have been disclosed in the risk factors mentioned below. However, there are risk factors where the impact may not be quantifiable and hence the same has not been disclosed in such risk factors. Unless otherwise stated, the financial information of the Company used in this section is derived from our financial statements under Indian GAAP, as restated in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. Unless otherwise stated, we are not in a position to specify or quantify the financial or other risks mentioned herein. For capitalized terms used but not defined in this chapter, refer to the chapter titled "Definitions and Abbreviations" beginning on page 1 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The numbering of the risk factors has been done to facilitate ease of reading and reference and does not in any manner indicate the importance of one risk factor over another.

The risk factors are classified as Internal and External for clarity and better understanding.

## INTERNAL RISKS

### A. BUSINESS RELATED RISKS

1. We are heavily dependent on few suppliers from whom we procure our material on a regular basis, the absence of readily available alternative sources may expose us to supply chain risks, which could materially affect our operations, profitability, and financial condition.

Our operations rely heavily on a select group of key suppliers for the procurement of raw materials and bought-out items, which are sourced on a daily basis. This concentration of procurement introduces a level of dependency that may pose risks to our supply chain and overall business continuity.
