**Secondary Sector (↑8.2 percent YoY in Q1 FY2026):** Broad based momentum across manufacturing and construction
The secondary sector expanded by 8.2 percent in Q1 FY2026 compared with 9.2 percent a year earlier, reflecting sustained
but moderated growth.

1. Manufacturing GVA rose by 8.8 percent, improving from 8.4 percent in the previous year. Robust performance in automobiles, capital goods and select PLI linked industries offset softness in consumer durables and textiles. For fabricated metal producers, rising demand from automotive, engineering and capital equipment provided downstream support.
2. Electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services grew by 2.1 percent, following a 7.1 percent expansion last year. The slower growth indicates stabilization of base demand after a period of strong expansion, even as renewable capacity additions continued.
3. Construction posted a healthy 9.4 percent rise after 11.0 percent in the previous year. Public infrastructure programmes in roads, railways and urban housing remained the primary driver. Execution momentum in large states sustained demand for steel, cement and fabricated structures.

**Tertiary Sector (↑11.9 percent YoY in Q1 FY2026):** Services remain the anchor of growth
The tertiary sector, which accounts for the largest share of GVA, grew by 11.9 percent in Q1 FY2026 compared with
10.0 percent in the same period last year.

1. Financial, real estate and professional services recorded an expansion of 11.0 percent, improving from 9.7 percent previously. Rising credit offtake, resilient real estate activity and continued demand for professional services underpinned this growth. The sector indirectly supported industrial growth through housing finance, infrastructure funding and corporate expansion.
2. Public administration, defence and other services grew strongly by 11.3 percent after an exceptionally high 16.7 percent in the previous year. The sector continues to be supported by government expenditure, defence procurement and welfare related disbursements.
3. Trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting registered 9.4 percent growth, accelerating from 7.7 percent a year earlier. The improvement reflects higher freight and passenger traffic, stronger retail sales and robust e-commerce penetration. These developments have spillover effects on logistics infrastructure and associated demand for fabricated warehousing and distribution assets.

## 2. Commodity markets

Commodity markets operate within inherently cyclical structures, shaped by macroeconomic cycles, geopolitical developments, and structural shifts in supply chains. Prices across energy, precious metals, and industrial metals are determined by global trade flows, production capacity, inventory levels, and policy interventions. These fluctuations carry direct implications for downstream manufacturing, especially in sectors reliant on raw material inputs such as steel and aluminium

The period from March 2020 to March 2025 has been defined by a series of external shocks and structural realignments, including the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale fiscal and monetary interventions, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and evolving trade policies across key economies. The following charts summarize price developments across three commodity clusters—energy, precious metals, and industrial metals.

### Energy Markets (Crude Oil, LNG)

Global energy prices declined sharply in early 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brent crude oil fell below $20 per barrel by April 2020 due to demand destruction and storage limitations. Subsequently, coordinated production cuts by OPEC+ and the normalization of mobility and industrial activity contributed to a multi-quarter recovery.
