48. We have entered into related party transactions in the past and may continue to do so in the future.

Our Company has entered into various transactions with our Promoter and promoter group. While we believe that all such transactions are conducted on arm's length basis, there can be no assurance that we could not have achieved more favorable terms had such transactions were not entered into with related parties. Furthermore, it is likely that we will enter into related party transactions in future. There can be no assurance that such transactions, individually or in aggregate, will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. For details on the transactions entered by us, please refer to chapter "Related Party Transactions" beginning on page 206 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

49. Delay in delivery of the products due to breakdown of machinery and/or equipment.

Delays in the delivery of products can significantly impact on the overall efficiency and reliability of our business operations, particularly when they stem from breakdowns or defects in machinery and equipment utilized in our manufacturing processes. Any malfunction or failure of critical equipment can lead to a halt in production, disrupting the carefully scheduled timelines that we rely on to meet customer expectations. The time required for repairs or replacements of the affected machinery can vary, and if it extends beyond anticipated durations, it may result in missed deadlines for product delivery. Such delays not only jeopardize our commitments to clients but also undermine our reputation in the market, potentially leading to dissatisfaction and loss of trust among our customers. Additionally, prolonged equipment downtime can escalate operational costs, as we may incur additional expenses related to emergency repairs or the procurement of replacement machinery. Consequently, these disruptions can have an adverse effect on the company's financial performance and competitive position, emphasizing the importance of maintaining and upgrading our machinery and equipment to ensure uninterrupted production capabilities.

These delays can have a cascading effect on the entire production timeline, resulting in late deliveries to customers, missed deadlines, and an overall impact on revenue.

Additionally, delays could lead to increased operational costs, such as the need for expedited shipping, and overtime labor to catch up on lost time, or penalties for failing to meet contractual deadlines. This can also harm our reputation, as customers may lose trust in our ability to deliver on time, potentially resulting in lost business or future orders. Although there has been no occurrence of such an instance in the past regarding the delay in delivery of the products due to the breakdown of machinery and/or equipment but it may occur in future which can impact on our business.

50. Our insurance coverage may prove inadequate to satisfy future claims against us.

Our operations are subject to risks inherent in manufacturing facilities such as risk of equipment failure, work accidents, fire, earthquakes, flood and other force majeure events, acts of terrorism and explosions including hazards that may cause injury and loss of life, severe damage to and the destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. Our significant insurance policies consist of insurance policy of HDFC ERGO GIC Ltd. covering Material Damage, Burglary & Housebreaking. Currently the policies are in the name Shreyas Fabtech Limited. Failure to effectively cover ourselves against the associated risks may potentially lead to material losses. There can be no assurance that our insurance policies will be adequate to cover the losses/ damage suffered or that such insurance coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If we suffer a significant uninsured loss or if insurance claim in respect of the subject matter of insurance is not accepted or any insured loss suffered by us significantly exceeds our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our Company has not filed any insurance claim for the period ending March 2025, 2024, and 2023.
