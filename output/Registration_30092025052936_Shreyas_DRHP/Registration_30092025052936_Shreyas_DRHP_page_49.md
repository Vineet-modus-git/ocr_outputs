any material instance of fraud or internal control failure may adversely impact our credibility with clients, lenders, suppliers, and other stakeholders, thereby affecting our Company's growth prospects and reputation in the fabrication industry.

**31. The shortage or non-availability of power facilities may adversely affect our manufacturing process and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.**

Our manufacturing operations are highly power-intensive and rely heavily on the continuous availability of electricity, which we primarily source from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Any disruption in power supply, whether due to grid failures, transmission constraints, equipment breakdowns, fuel shortages, load-shedding, natural calamities, or regulatory restrictions, could result in significant production delays, reduced capacity utilization, or even temporary shutdown of operations.

Frequent or prolonged power outages may also increase our reliance on backup arrangements, which are costly to operate and may not be sufficient to meet our production requirements on a sustained basis. In addition, any upward revision in electricity tariffs or regulatory changes in power distribution could increase our operating costs. Since uninterrupted power supply is critical to our ability to maintain production schedules and deliver products on time, any such disruptions or cost escalations may materially and adversely impact our operations, business performance, profitability, and financial condition.

**32. Our manufacturing capabilities may become less competitive if we fail to adopt evolving fabrication technologies**

While the Company currently operates with laser and plasma cutting systems along with CNC bending and welding infrastructure, the fabrication industry is rapidly moving towards automation, real-time quality assurance systems, and multi-axis robotic processing. If the Company does not upgrade its infrastructure in alignment with evolving industry standards, it may be unable to meet new customer expectations around quality, turnaround time, and design complexity. This technological stagnation could impact the Company's ability to win high-value contracts or renew existing ones. The lack of timely investment in manufacturing technologies exposes the Company to competitiveness erosion and obsolescence risk.

**33. Our revenues are dependent upon our meeting specific customer requirements largely on a case-to-case basis. Any failure or limitation on our ability to provide services may detrimentally affect our future growth.**

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from our ability to meet specific customer requirements, which are generally assessed and fulfilled on a case-by-case basis. Our business model requires us to tailor products or services to the precise specifications, quality standards, and timelines requested by individual customers. Any inability, delay, or limitation in fulfilling these specific requirements could result in dissatisfied customers, order cancellations, or loss of future business opportunities.

Since our growth and profitability largely depend on repeat business and establishing strong relationships with customers, failure to consistently meet these expectations may adversely impact our reputation, customer trust, and market competitiveness. Moreover, if we are unable to adapt to evolving customer needs or provide customized solutions efficiently, our future revenues, operational performance, and overall financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

**34. Activities involving our manufacturing process can be dangerous and can cause injury to people or property in certain circumstances.**

A significant disruption to any of our manufacturing facilities may adversely affect our production schedules, costs, sales and ability to meet customer demand. Our business operations are subject to hazards such as the risk of equipment failure, work accidents, fire or explosion and require individuals to work under potentially dangerous circumstances or with flammable materials. Although we employ safety procedures in the operation of our facilities and maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance, there is a risk that an accident or death may occur in one of our facilities. An accident may result in destruction of property or equipment, environmental damage, manufacturing or delivery delays, or may lead to suspension of our operations and/or imposition of liabilities. Any such accident may result in litigation, the outcome of which is difficult to assess or quantify, and the cost to defend litigation can be significant. As a result, the costs to defend any action or the potential liability resulting from any such accident or death or arising out of any other litigation, and any negative publicity associated therewith, may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In particular, if operations at our manufacturing facility were to be disrupted as a result of any significant workplace accident, equipment failure, power outage, fire, explosion, labour dispute, obsolescence or other reasons, our financial performance may be adversely affected as a result of our inability to meet customer demand or committed delivery schedules for our products. Interruptions in production may also increase our costs and reduce our sales, and may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation or to defend litigation that we may become involved in as a result, which may negatively affect our profitability, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
