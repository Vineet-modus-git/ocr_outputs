Once listed, we would be subject to circuit breakers imposed by the stock exchange, which does not allow transactions beyond specified increases or decreases in the price of the Equity Shares. This circuit breaker operates independently of the index-based market-wide circuit breakers generally imposed by SEBI. The percentage limit on circuit breakers is said by the stock exchange based on the historical volatility in the price and trading volume of the Equity Shares. The stock exchange does not inform us of the percentage limit of the circuit breaker in effect from time to time and may change it without our knowledge. This circuit breaker limits the upward and downward movements in the price of the Equity Shares. As a result of the circuit breaker, no assurance may be given regarding your ability to sell your Equity Shares or the price at which you may be able to sell your Equity Shares at any time.
