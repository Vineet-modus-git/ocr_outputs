## OUR STRATEGY

### 1. Modernization and Capacity Augmentation:

We intend to deploy a portion of the Issue proceeds towards capital expenditure for modern and technologically advanced machinery. The objective is to strengthen our manufacturing infrastructure by reducing process lead times, lowering processing costs, and aligning our operations with global best practices in fabrication. This strategic modernization will enable us to undertake larger, more complex, and higher-margin assignments, thereby positioning us to meet the growing demand in both domestic and international markets.
