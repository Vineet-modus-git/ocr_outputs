Our Company's Financial Year commences on April 1 of the immediately preceding calendar year and ends on March 31 of that calendar year, so all references to a particular financial year are to the 12-month period commencing on April 1 of the immediately preceding calendar year and ending on March 31 of that particular calendar year.

You should consult your own advisors regarding such differences and their impact on our financial data.

Any percentage amounts, as set forth in "Risk Factors", "Our Business", "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus unless otherwise indicated, have been calculated on the basis of the Company's restated financial statements prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act, Indian GAAP and restated in accordance with SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, as stated in the report of our Statutory Auditor, set out in the section titled "Financial Statements as Restated" beginning on page 207 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
