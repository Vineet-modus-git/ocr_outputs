Indian mills, while insulated from global iron ore fluctuations due to strong domestic reserves, remained exposed to imported coking coal, rendering mill-level margins sensitive to ex-Australia pricing. Third, macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, housing starts, and PMI indices influenced steel demand visibility across key end-user sectors. The gradual shift in global central bank guidance toward easing in Q1 2025 improved forward sentiment, especially in the construction and automotive industries. Fourth, trade policy developments including the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), safeguard quotas, and shifting bilateral tariffs altered trade flows and prompted opportunistic arbitrage moves by exporters. Lastly, seasonality remained a consistent feature, with consumption upticks visible in India post-monsoon (Oct–Dec) and in China following the Lunar New Year (Feb–Apr), resulting in short-term price buoyancy during those intervals."}, {"bbox": [153, 476, 414, 512], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Input Cost Dynamics"}, {"bbox": [151, 539, 1499, 736], "category": "Text", "text": "Steel pricing is fundamentally linked to the cost structure of its primary raw materials, with fluctuations in input prices exerting a direct influence on mill profitability, market supply decisions, and end-product pricing. The two most critical inputs in traditional steelmaking are iron ore and coking coal, both of which are traded globally and display significant volatility based on supply disruptions, policy shifts, and demand cycles. Additionally, steel scrap and energy inputs such as electricity and natural gas particularly for Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)-based production—have become increasingly relevant in determining steel pricing trajectories."}, {"bbox": [151, 764, 1499, 993], "category": "Text", "text": "The attached chart illustrates the strong directional relationship between Hot-Rolled Coil (HRC) steel prices and iron ore benchmarks (Platts 62% Fe CFR China), particularly evident during the 2020–2021 rally and subsequent corrections. In early 2021, iron ore prices surged above USD 220/tonne on the back of pandemic-related supply constraints in Brazil (Vale's output recovery lag) and robust restocking demand from Chinese mills. HRC prices followed, rising above USD 1,800/tonne in the U.S. Midwest and ~USD 1,200/tonne FOB China, reflecting both cost-push inflation and tight supply. The steep correction from mid-2021 through 2022 was similarly synchronized, as Chinese steel output declined due to mandated production caps and real estate sector weakness, pushing iron ore back towards the USD 100–120/tonne range."}, {"bbox": [156, 1014, 1496, 1557], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [153, 1584, 354, 1616], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: TradingView"}, {"bbox": [151, 1643, 1499, 1872], "category": "Text", "text": "Beyond iron ore, coking coal remains a critical cost driver, particularly for Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF)-based steelmaking, which accounts for over 70% of global crude steel output. Prices for premium hard coking coal (HCC FOB Australia) have ranged between USD 130 and USD 420/tonne over the last three years, with spikes driven by flooding in Queensland (a major export hub), labour shortages, and shifts in Chinese import policy. For Indian producers, who import over 85% of their coking coal requirements, the impact of these price movements is substantial. In early 2022 and again in late 2024, elevated coking coal prices materially compressed Indian steel mill spreads, particularly in the flat product segment. This prompted a mix of cost pass-through, strategic destocking, and temporary production cuts."}, {"bbox": [151, 1898, 1499, 2095], "category": "Text", "text": "Steel scrap is a particularly important input in EAF and Induction Furnace (IF)-based production, more prevalent in developed economies and mid-sized producers in India. Scrap prices, benchmarked through indices such as HMS 1&2 CFR Turkey or Shredded Scrap CFR India, influence both cost structures and trade flows. During periods of high iron ore and coal pricing, EAF route competitiveness increases, provided scrap availability and power costs remain favourable. However, global scrap markets are increasingly subject to tightening export controls (e.g., EU Green Deal policies), raising long-term cost pressures on scrap-dependent producers."}]
