Techniques include: - Laser cutting: High-precision thermal cutting using focused laser beams, ideal for thin metals. - Plasma cutting: Ionized gas jet-based cutting for thicker metals. - Waterjet cutting: Cold cutting using high-pressure water mixed with abrasives, used for heat-sensitive applications. - Shearing: Mechanical slicing using blades, suited for basic dimensional reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Forming &amp; Bending</td><td>Utilizes press brakes, rollers, or hammers to deform metal without removing material. Bending angles and radii are governed by metal thickness and die design.</td></tr><tr><td>Punching &amp; Stamping</td><td>High-speed presses are used to indent or cut sheet metal using dies. Particularly effective for repetitive, high-volume components.</td></tr><tr><td>Machining</td><td>Material is removed to achieve tight tolerances using turning, milling, or drilling machines (manual or CNC). Used where precise fitment or threading is needed.</td></tr><tr><td>Welding &amp; Joining</td><td>Permanent joining of metal parts via heat or pressure. Key techniques: - MIG (Metal Inert Gas): Common for structural steel. - TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas): High precision, used for aluminium and stainless steel. - Arc welding: Widely used for heavy sections.</td></tr><tr><td>Assembly</td><td>Incorporates fastening techniques—riveting, bolting, spot welding—and alignment for integrated assemblies.</td></tr><tr><td>Surface Treatment &amp; Finishing</td><td>Enhances aesthetics and protection. Includes: - Powder coating: Durable, solvent-free coating. - Hot-dip galvanizing: Zinc coating to prevent corrosion in steel. - Anodizing: Electrochemical process for aluminium that increases corrosion and wear resistance.</td></tr><tr><td>Inspection &amp; Testing</td><td>Final quality checks including ultrasonic testing, surface roughness, tolerance verification, and structural integrity testing. Essential for OEM compliance.</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [152, 1463, 655, 1501], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Sectoral Applications and Value Addition"}, {"bbox": [152, 1528, 1500, 1629], "category": "Text", "text": "The versatility of fabricated metal products allows them to serve as mission-critical inputs across a wide array of industries.
