OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS

The Company was incorporated in 2022 under the name of "Shreyas Fabtech Limited" bearing the CIN No.
U28999MH2022PLC391593. In 2023, we acquired the running business of Shreyas Engineers, a proprietorship engaged
in the manufacturing of fabrication and press parts, pursuant to a Memorandum of Undertaking dated May 01, 2023, and
a Business Transfer Agreement dated August 28, 2023 (effective from May 01, 2023).

We are a metal fabrication company engaged in the production of precision-engineered components that serve structural and mechanical functions across industrial and infrastructure applications. Our product range includes hot-dip galvanized steel assemblies, aluminium fabrication parts, diesel engine sub-assemblies, deep drawn parts for pneumatic and control systems, weighbridges, and solar panel mounts. These components are manufactured through processes such as cutting, pressing, forming, welding, and surface treatment, and are designed to meet high-performance requirements in demanding operating environments.

Our manufacturing capabilities span precision presswork and structural fabrication across medium to heavy-gauge steel and aluminium, including tubular profiles and sheet metal. We specialize in producing complex assemblies such as telecom brackets, weighbridge decks, and deep-drawn housings for control and pneumatic systems.

We utilize a comprehensive range of raw materials including hot rolled steel products, aluminium components, and structural steel elements in the manufacturing of our metal fabrication products

We operate two manufacturing units in Nashik, Maharashtra. Our Plant I is located in the MIDC Ambad industrial zone, while Plant II is situated on Dindori Road, approximately 25 km from Nashik city. Each plant is equipped with heavy-duty overhead cranes and a centralized tool room for in-house development of stamping dies, jigs, and fixtures. Our manufacturing infrastructure is designed to support precision fabrication of components with complex geometries and tight dimensional tolerances. We use automated equipment such as robotic welding systems, CNC laser cutters, and plasma cutting machines to manufacture structurally complex and dimensionally accurate components. These tools enable us to handle varied material thicknesses and intricate geometries with consistency and efficiency.

Quality and technical capability are central to our operations. We are ISO 9001:2015 certified and maintain stringent quality controls across all manufacturing processes. All production tooling and fixtures are designed and maintained in-house, providing us with tight control over manufacturing precision. We have also developed special-purpose machines of our own design to enhance production efficiency. These in-house engineering capabilities, combined with systematic quality processes, help us ensure consistent product quality and meet exacting customer specifications.

Our customer base spans both domestic and international markets. Domestically, we serve OEMs and fabricators across
India in the industries we cater to. We also export components, particularly hot-dip galvanized telecom assemblies to
global markets. Over the years, we have supplied these products to customers in the United States of America and select
European countries.
