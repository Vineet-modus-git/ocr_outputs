Between October and January, prices exhibited relative stability within a band of USD 2,500-2,650/tonne.

However, prices reversed sharply in late March and early April 2025, retreating to USD 2,378/tonne. The decline was precipitated by a combination of soft PMI prints from Europe and China, a stronger US dollar which weighed on non-ferrous prices, and inventory builds at LME warehouses, especially in Malaysia and South Korea, signalling short-term oversupply."}, {"bbox": [151, 702, 1499, 834], "category": "Text", "text": "Overall, the aluminium price trajectory over the past 12 months underscores the metal's sensitivity to both structural supply chain factors particularly energy and raw material access and broader macroeconomic sentiment.

Given this, the cost and availability of electricity especially in regions where it is predominantly generated through coal play a pivotal role in shaping aluminium supply economics and consequently, market pricing. Coal, which accounts for over 60% of global electricity generation (IEA, 2024), is a particularly important input in emerging economies like India, China, Indonesia, and South Africa, where its share exceeds 70% in many states or provinces. The significance of this relationship is especially heightened in India, where approximately 90% of aluminium is smelted using captive coal-fired power plants owned by major producers such as Vedanta, Hindalco, and NALCO, according to data from the Ministry of Mines."}, {"bbox": [151, 1208, 1499, 1820], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [151, 1846, 352, 1877], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: TradingView"}, {"bbox": [151, 1905, 1499, 2135], "category": "Text", "text": "The chart above captures the five-year trend correlation between aluminium prices and thermal coal prices. Historically, a positive correlation has been observed - spikes in coal prices, especially during the global energy crisis of 2021-22, were directly associated with rising aluminium prices as smelting costs surged globally. For instance, in late 2021, coal shortages in China triggered widespread power rationing, resulting in a 2-million-tonne drop in Chinese aluminium output and driving LME aluminium prices past USD 3,000/tonne. Similarly, India's coal shortage in 2021 forced several aluminium players to switch to costly spot market coal, pushing up their production costs and leading to tight domestic supply."}]
