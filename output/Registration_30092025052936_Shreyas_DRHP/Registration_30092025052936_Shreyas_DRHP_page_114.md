## II. Under the Indirect Tax Laws

### 1. Special Indirect Tax Benefits available to the Company

#### a) Benefits under the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017, respective State Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (read with relevant Rules prescribed thereunder)

* Under the GST regime, all supplies of goods and services which qualify as export of goods or services are zero-rated, that is, these transactions attract a GST rate of zero per cent.

* There are two mechanisms for claiming refund of accumulated ITC against export. Person can export under Bond/Letter of Undertaking (LUT) as zero-rated supply and claim refund of accumulated Input Tax Credit or person may export on payment of integrated Goods and Services Tax and claim refund thereof as per the provisions of Section 54 of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.

* Thus, the GST law allows the flexibility to the exporter (which will include the supplier making supplies to SEZ) to claim refund upfront as integrated tax (by making supplies on payment of tax using ITC) or export without payment of tax by executing a Bond/LUT and claim refund of related ITC of taxes paid on inputs and input services used in making zero rated supplies.
