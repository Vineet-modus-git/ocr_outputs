We fabricate these assemblies using rolled sections and steel plates based on customer specifications. Our weighbridges are typically installed at industrial plants, logistics hubs, and mining or infrastructure sites. They support repetitive loading from trucks and material-handling vehicles and comply with dimensional and accuracy requirements defined by the application. These units help users meet regulatory weight recording requirements and manage operational logistics."}, {"bbox": [485, 1095, 1163, 1430], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [742, 1453, 912, 1488], "category": "Caption", "text": "Weigh Bridges"}, {"bbox": [154, 1529, 1030, 1563], "category": "Text", "text": "Representative illustration depicting end-use systems in their assembled form:"}, {"bbox": [595, 1590, 1054, 2051], "category": "Picture"}]
