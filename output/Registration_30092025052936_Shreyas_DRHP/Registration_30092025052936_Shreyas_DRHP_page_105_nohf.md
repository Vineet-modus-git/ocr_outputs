i) Basic EPS is calculated as Profit/(loss) for the year/period attributable to owners of parent divided by the adjusted weighted average number of basic equity shares outstanding during the year/period.

ii) Diluted EPS is calculated as Profit/(loss) for the year/period attributable to owners of parent divided by the adjusted weighted average number of adjusted diluted equity shares outstanding during the year/period.

3) Weighted average number of equity shares is the number of equity shares outstanding at the beginning of the year/period adjusted by the number of equity shares issued during the year/period multiplied by the time weighting factor. The time weighting factor is the number of days for which the specific shares are outstanding as a proportion of total number of days during the year/period.

4) Weighted average is aggregate of year-wise weighted EPS divided by the aggregate of weights i.e. {(EPS x Weight) for each year} / {Total of weights}.

2. Net asset value per equity share = net worth attributable to the owners of the company as at the end of the year/period divided by adjusted number of equity shares outstanding as at the end of year/period.
