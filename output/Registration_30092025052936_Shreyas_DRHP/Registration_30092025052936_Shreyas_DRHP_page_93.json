As on date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there are no partly paid-up equity shares and all the Equity Shares of our Company are fully paid up. Further, since the entire money in respect of the Offer is being called on application, all the successful applicants will be issued fully paid-up equity shares.\n27. As on the date of filing of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there are no outstanding warrants, options or rights to convert debentures, loans or other instruments which would entitle Promoters or any shareholders or any other person any option to acquire our Equity Shares after this Initial Public Offer.\n28. As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, the Book Running Lead Manager and their respective associates (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992) do not hold any Equity Shares of our Company. The Book Running Lead Manager and their affiliates may engage in the transactions with and perform services for our Company in the ordinary course of business or may in the future engage in commercial banking and investment banking transactions with our Company for which they may in the future receive customary compensation.\n29. Investors may note that in case of over-subscription, allotment will be on proportionate basis as detailed under \"Basis of Allotment\" in the chapter titled \"Offer Procedure\" beginning on page 273 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. In case of over-subscription in all categories the allocation in the Offer shall be as per the requirements of Regulation 253 (3) of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, as amended from time to time.\n30. An over-subscription to the extent of 10% of the Net Offer can be retained for the purpose of rounding off to the nearest integer during finalizing the allotment, subject to minimum allotment, which is the minimum application size in this Offer. Consequently, the actual allotment may go up by a maximum of 10% of the Offer, as a result of which, the post Offer paid up capital after the Offer would also increase by the excess amount of allotment so made. In such an event, the Equity Shares held by the Promoters and subject to lock-in shall be suitably increased; so as to ensure that 20% of the post Offer paid-up capital is locked in.\n31. Our Company has not raised any bridge loan against the proceeds of this Offer. However, depending on business requirements, we might consider raising bridge financing facilities, pending receipt of the Net Proceeds.\n32. Our Company undertakes that at any given time, there shall be only one denomination for our Equity Shares, unless otherwise permitted by law.\n33. The unsubscribed portion in any reserved category (if any) may be added to any other reserved category.\n34. The unsubscribed portion if any, after such inter se adjustments among the reserved categories shall be added back to the net Offer to the public portion.\n35. Our Company shall comply with such accounting and disclosure norms as specified by SEBI from time to time.\n36. There are no Equity Shares against which depository receipts have been issued.\n37. As per RBI regulations, OCBs are not allowed to participate in this offer\n38. This Offer is being made through Book Built Method.\n39.
