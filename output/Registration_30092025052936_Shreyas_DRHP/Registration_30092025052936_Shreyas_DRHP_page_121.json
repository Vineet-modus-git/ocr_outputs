Agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishing recorded an increase of 3.2 percent supported by favourable sowing conditions and stable horticultural output.

In contrast, mining and quarrying contracted by 10.1 percent owing to weaker coal and mineral ore production and supply side constraints. The contraction in mining weighed on cost structures across energy intensive and bulk commodity reliant industries."}]
