Aluminium Extrusion Parts and Fabrications"}, {"bbox": [153, 790, 1500, 985], "category": "Text", "text": "Our aluminium extrusion-based components are fabricated using lightweight, corrosion-resistant aluminium profiles that are formed, cut, and welded to meet specific mechanical and dimensional requirements. Unlike hot-dip galvanized (HDG) steel components that are preferred for high-load structural use, these aluminium assemblies are intended for rooftop, elevated, or constrained-site applications where weight, handling ease, and long-term weather resistance are critical. These components are widely used in telecom infrastructure and ancillary installations where fast deployment and minimal structural load are priorities."}, {"bbox": [156, 1017, 1500, 1212], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Sector Mounting Frames:** Sector mounting frames are precision-fabricated aluminium structures designed to securely hold telecom antennas or sectoral radio units in pre-defined orientations on rooftop or pole-mounted sites. They are typically L- or U-shaped assemblies with slots and fixtures for angle adjustment. These frames are primarily used in multi-antenna installations where directional stability is essential for network coverage. Their lightweight aluminium build reduces installation time and load-bearing impact on host structures while offering resistance to corrosion, especially in coastal or high-humidity environments."}, {"bbox": [156, 1242, 1500, 1436], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Support Brackets:** Support brackets made from aluminium extrusions are used to attach peripheral equipment such as cable trays, junction boxes, or small enclosures to existing tower structures or mounting poles. These brackets are formed into Z, L, or custom shapes and often feature slotted holes for flexible attachment. They are deployed in both indoor and outdoor telecom sites where secure anchoring and ease of maintenance are required. Aluminium's high strength-to-weight ratio ensures mechanical reliability without excessive load, while its corrosion resistance ensures sustained performance over extended service cycles."}, {"bbox": [156, 1467, 1500, 1662], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Gusset Plates:** Gusset plates are flat or angled aluminium connectors used to reinforce structural joints between mounting arms, vertical supports, or cross members in antenna frames or equipment racks. These are precision-cut and drilled to match component geometries, ensuring structural integrity at connection points. They are mainly employed in rooftop structures where additional load transfer or wind resistance is required. The use of aluminium ensures durability under thermal expansion while keeping the total assembly weight low, which is especially beneficial in high-rise or temporary installations."}, {"bbox": [624, 1713, 1026, 2062], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [662, 2086, 988, 2117], "category": "Caption", "text": "Aluminium Extrusion Parts"}]
