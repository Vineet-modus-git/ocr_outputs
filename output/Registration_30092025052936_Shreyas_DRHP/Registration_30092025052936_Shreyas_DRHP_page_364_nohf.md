## DISPOSAL OF INVESTOR GRIEVANCES BY OUR COMPANY

Our Company has appointed MUFG India Private Limited as the Registrar to the Issue to handle the investor grievances in co-ordination with the Compliance Officer of the Company. All grievances relating to the present Issue may be addressed to the Registrar with a copy to the Compliance Officer, giving full details such as name, address of the applicant, number of Equity Shares applied for, amount paid on application and name of bank and branch. The Company would monitor the work of the Registrar to ensure that the investor grievances are settled expeditiously and satisfactorily.

The Registrar to the Issue will handle investor's grievances pertaining to the Issue. A fortnightly status report of the complaints received and redressed by them would be forwarded to the Company.

All grievances relating to the ASBA process and UPI may be addressed to the SCSBs, giving full details such as name, address of the Applicant, number of Equity Shares applied for, amount paid on application and the Designated Branch of the SCSB where the Application Form was submitted by the ASBA Applicant.

In case of non-routine complaints and complaints where external agencies are involved, we will seek to redress these complaints as expeditiously as possible.
