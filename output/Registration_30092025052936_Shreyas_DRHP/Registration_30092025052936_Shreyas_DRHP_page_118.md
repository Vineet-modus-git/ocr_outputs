## Key Considerations

1. Global Growth Resilient but Below Historical Average

World GDP growth is projected at 3.0 percent in 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, a slight upward revision from April but still well below the pre pandemic average of 3.7 percent. The near-term improvement reflects stronger trade activity and better financial conditions, though the overall profile remains fragile.

2. Divergence between Services and Manufacturing

Services continue to expand at a stronger pace, supported by resilient consumption and investment in information-based industries, while manufacturing growth remains uneven and subject to supply chain adjustments linked to trade policy shifts.

3. Disinflation Continues but is Uneven Across Economies

Global headline inflation is expected to ease to 4.2 percent in 2025 and 3.6 percent in 2026, broadly in line with April projections. Inflation is expected to remain above target in the United States, while price pressures in the euro area and several emerging markets are more subdued. Risks remain from potential tariff escalation and renewed commodity price shocks.

4. Monetary Policy Easing Underway but Uneven

Policy rates in the United States and the United Kingdom are projected to decline during the second half of 2025, while the euro area is expected to maintain current settings and Japan to pursue gradual tightening. The divergence reflects different stages of disinflation and country specific conditions.

5. Trade Activity Distorted by Tariff Front-Loading

Global trade volumes have been revised upward for 2025, reflecting front-loading of activity ahead of potential tariff increases. This effect is expected to fade in 2026, resulting in weaker trade growth. Tariff related uncertainty remains a central driver of near-term global activity.

6. Financial Conditions Have Eased but Fiscal Risks Remain

Global financial conditions have become more accommodative, with equity markets recovering and capital inflows resuming in emerging markets. However, large fiscal deficits in several advanced economies, notably the United States, continue to raise concerns about long term debt sustainability and potential volatility in sovereign bond markets.

7. Geopolitical Tensions and Policy Uncertainty Persist

The outlook is subject to elevated downside risks from geopolitical developments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and from uncertainty around the trajectory of US tariff policy. Any renewed escalation could disrupt supply chains, lift commodity prices, and challenge central banks in balancing price stability with growth support.

8. Structural Vulnerabilities in Financial Systems
