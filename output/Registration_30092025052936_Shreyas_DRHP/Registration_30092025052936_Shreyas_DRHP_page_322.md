Each lease rental paid is allocated between the liability and the interest cost so as to obtain a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability for each year.

Lease arrangements where the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset substantially vest with the lessor, are recognised as operating leases. Lease rentals under operating leases are recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis.

## 16. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent asset

Provisions involving substantial degree of estimation in measurement are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. Contingent liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed in the notes and are not usually provided for unless it is probable that future outcome may be detrimental to the company. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.

## 17. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and balances with banks. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.
