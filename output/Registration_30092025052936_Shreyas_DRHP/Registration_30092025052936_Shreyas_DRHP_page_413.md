* a maximum number of two Anchor Investors for allocation up to ₹2 crores;

* a minimum number of two Anchor Investors and maximum number of 15 Anchor Investors for allocation of more than ₹2 crores and up to ₹25 crores subject to minimum allotment of ₹1 crores per such Anchor Investor; and

c) In the event that the Offer Price is higher than the Anchor Investor Allocation Price:

Anchor Investors will be sent a revised CAN within one day of the Pricing Date indicating the number of Equity Shares allocated to such Anchor Investor and the pay-in date for payment of the balance amount. Anchor Investors are then required to pay any additional amounts, being the difference between the Offer Price and the Anchor Investor Allocation Price, as indicated in the revised CAN within the pay-in date referred to in the revised CAN. Thereafter, the Allotment Advice will be issued to such Anchor Investors.

d) In the event the Offer Price is lower than the Anchor Investor Allocation Price:

Anchor Investors who have been Allotted Equity Shares will directly receive Allotment Advice.

e) Basis of Allotment for QIBs (other than Anchor Investors) and NIIs in case of Over Subscribed Offer:

In the event of the Offer Being Over-Subscribed, the Issuer may finalise the Basis of Allotment in consultation with the National Stock Exchange Limited ("NSE or NSE Emerge") (The Designated Stock Exchange). The allocation may be made in marketable lots on proportionate basis as set forth hereunder:

a) The total number of Shares to be allocated to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e., the total number of Shares applied for in that category multiplied by the inverse of the oversubscription ratio (number of Bidders in the category multiplied by number of Shares applied for).

b) The number of Shares to be allocated to the successful Bidders will be arrived at on a proportionate basis in marketable lots (i.e., Total number of Shares applied for into the inverse of the over subscription ratio).

c) For Bids where the proportionate allotment works out to less than [•] equity shares the allotment will be made as follows:

* Each successful Bidder shall be allotted [•] equity shares; and

* The successful Bidder out of the total bidders for that category shall be determined by draw of lots in such a manner that the total number of Shares allotted in that category is equal to the number of Shares worked out as per (b) above.

d) If the proportionate allotment to a Bidder works out to a number that is not a multiple of [•] equity shares, the Bidder would be allotted Shares by rounding off to the nearest multiple of [•] equity shares subject to a minimum allotment of [•] equity shares.

e) If the Shares allotted on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the Shares allotted to the Bidders in that category, the balance available Shares or allocation shall be first adjusted against any category, where the allotted Shares are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful Bidder in that category, the balance Shares,
