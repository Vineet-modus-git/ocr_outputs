## 5 Depreciation/Amortisation

Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on written down value basis over the estimated useful life of the assets using the indicative useful life as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except as mentioned in below table. The Company has used the following useful life to provide depreciation on property, plant and equipment:

<table><thead><tr><td>Asset Category</td><td>Useful Life (in years)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Buildings (RCC Structure)</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Factory Building</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and Machinery</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and Fixtures</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>

Intangible assets are amortised over the estimated period of economic benefits on a straight line basis, commencing from the date the assets are available to the Company for its use.

The estimated useful life of the intangible assets and the amortisation period are reviewed at the end of each financial year and the amortisation period is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if any. Intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal.
