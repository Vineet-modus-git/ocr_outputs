Buyers often require vendors to develop customized tooling, jigs, or fixtures aligned with their proprietary designs. Switching between vendors may be limited by factors such as requalification costs, tooling compatibility and costing, and the need for extended quality validation. This structure encourages the development of concentrated vendor relationships and promotes continuity in order flow, especially for fabricated components used in regulated or outdoor-deployed applications."}, {"bbox": [152, 413, 1501, 544], "category": "Text", "text": "While entry barriers remain low in the general fabrication space, suppliers targeting engineered or application-specific components typically require investment in process control, in-house engineering, and qualified personnel.
