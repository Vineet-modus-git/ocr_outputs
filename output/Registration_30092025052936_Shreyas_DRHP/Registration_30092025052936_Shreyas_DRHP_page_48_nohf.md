## 30. Risk relating to major fraud, lapses in internal controls, or system failures adversely impacting our Company's business, financial condition, and reputation

Our Company operates in the fabrication industry, which involves complex manufacturing processes, including procurement of raw materials, design, cutting, welding, machining, finishing, quality testing, and delivery to customers. The nature of our operations exposes us to risks arising from fraud, errors, or lapses in internal controls at various stages of the business cycle. These may include, among others, misappropriation of raw materials or finished goods, fabrication or manipulation of quality inspection records, inaccurate reporting of production or wastage, unauthorized procurement or diversion of inventory, and fraudulent billing by employees, suppliers, or contractors.

In addition, our reliance on machinery, technology-driven systems, and project management software exposes us to risks of system failures, cyber-attacks, or disruptions in information and communication systems. Any breakdown, data breach, or interception during electronic communication could compromise sensitive customer information, project specifications, or pricing details.

Failure to detect and prevent such lapses or fraudulent activities in a timely manner may result in operational inefficiencies, higher costs, financial losses, penalties, disputes with customers, or even cancellation of contracts. Further,
