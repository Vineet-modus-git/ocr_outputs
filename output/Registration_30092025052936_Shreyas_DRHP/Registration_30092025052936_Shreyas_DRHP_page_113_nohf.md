## I. Under the IT Act

### 1. Special Tax Benefits to the Company

#### a) Lower corporate tax rate on income of domestic companies under Section 115BAA of the ITA

The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 introduced section 115BAA wherein domestic companies are entitled to avail a concessional tax rate of 22% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on fulfillment of certain conditions.

The option to apply for this tax rate is available from Financial Year (FY') 2019-20 relevant to Assessment Year('AY')2020-21 and the option once exercised through filing of Form 10IC on the Income tax portal shall apply to subsequent assessment years. The concessional tax rate of 22% is subject to the company not availing any of the following deductions under the provisions of the ITA:

* Section10AA: Tax holiday available to units in a Special Economic Zone.

* Section 32(1)(iia): Additional depreciation.

* Section 32AD: Investment allowance.

* Section 33AB/3ABA: Tea coffee rubber development expenses/site restoration expenses

* Section 35(1)/35(2AA)/ 35(2AB): Expenditure on scientific research.

* Section 35AD: Deduction for capital expenditure incurred on specified businesses.

* Section 35CCC/35CCD: expenditure on agricultural extension /skill development

* Chapter VI-A except for the provisions of section 80JJAA and section 80M.

The total income of a company availing the concessional rate of 25.168% (i.e., 22% along with surcharge of 10% and health and education cess of 4%) is required to be computed without set off any carried forward loss and depreciation attributable to any of the aforesaid deductions/incentives. A company can exercise the option to apply for the concessional tax rate by filing Form 10IC on or before the due date of filing return of income under section 139(1) of the ITA. Further, provisions of Minimum Alternate Tax ('MAT') under section 115JB of the ITA shall not be applicable to companies availing this reduced tax rate, thus, any carried forward MAT credit also cannot be claimed. The provisions do not specify any limitation/condition on account of turnover, nature of business or date of incorporation for opting for the concessional tax rate. Accordingly, all existing as well as new domestic companies are eligible to avail this concessional rate of tax.

*Note: The Company has opted the lower rate under section 115BAA of the ITA.*
