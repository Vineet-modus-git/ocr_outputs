The pace of expansion moderated as fiscal consolidation efforts remained on track to align with the Union Government's fiscal deficit objective of 5.1 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, capital outlays have been preserved, particularly in transport infrastructure and defence, which is reflected in continued strength in public capital formation. Gross Fixed Capital Formation reached ₹26.15 lakh crore, representing 30.4 percent of GDP. The growth of 6.8 percent, though lower than the 9.2 percent expansion recorded in the previous year, points to sustained momentum in infrastructure development, manufacturing capacity creation and investment in power and transmission projects. Government capital expenditure has continued to play a catalytic role by crowding in private sector investment, a trend corroborated by rising imports of capital goods, which registered double digit growth in the latest high frequency data."}]
