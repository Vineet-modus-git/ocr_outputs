Despite a sharp fall in coal prices, aluminium prices remained relatively elevated through Q1 2025 before their recent decline. Several structural and situational factors explain this divergence. Firstly, aluminium prices during this period were influenced more by non-energy-related supply disruptions, such as smelter curtailments in China's Yunnan province due to hydro shortages, logistical bottlenecks affecting bauxite exports from Guinea, and geopolitical tensions disrupting maritime trade. These supply constraints kept aluminium prices high even as thermal coal markets corrected on the back of improved inventory, reduced winter demand, and a shift in Europe and China's generation mix."}, {"bbox": [151, 413, 1501, 609], "category": "Text", "text": "Secondly, the divergence is partially explained by the ongoing decarbonisation shift in developed economies. The EU, US, and Canada have increasingly transitioned away from coal in favour of renewable and nuclear energy. This decouples aluminium pricing from coal in these regions, especially where smelters are being retrofitted to run on hydro or wind-based captive power (e.g., Norway, Canada). Consequently, global aluminium prices—while still partly driven by coal— are increasingly being influenced by renewables-linked production in developed economies, making coal-aluminium correlation more region-specific."}, {"bbox": [151, 637, 1501, 833], "category": "Text", "text": "In contrast, India remains critically exposed to coal-based energy for aluminium production. The correlation remains highly relevant in the Indian context due to three key reasons: (1) a high dependence on captive coal-fired power in smelting operations; (2) frequent volatility in domestic coal logistics and railway availability; and (3) import dependency for high-calorific-value coal from Indonesia and Australia, which affects cost competitiveness. According to CRISIL and ICRA, a 10% spike in coal prices can increase aluminium production costs in India by nearly 5%, exerting direct pressure on margins, especially for integrated producers without fuel linkages."}, {"bbox": [151, 860, 515, 897], "category": "Section-header", "text": "# 3.

The production process is heavily machinery driven, with a strong dependence on precision equipment and skilled technical labour.

This exposure is often mitigated through hedging mechanisms or contractual pass-through arrangements with customers."}, {"bbox": [151, 1999, 1501, 2165], "category": "Text", "text": "Fabrication demand is also cyclically linked to broader macroeconomic and infrastructure investment trends, particularly in sectors like construction, automotive, industrial machinery, and power generation. During upcycles, order volumes rise due to increased capital formation and project activity, whereas downturns often lead to capacity underutilization and margin compression. The industry is typically highly customized, especially in mid- to high-end applications, where fabricators must deliver low-to-medium volume, high-complexity products tailored to specific client drawings and"}]
