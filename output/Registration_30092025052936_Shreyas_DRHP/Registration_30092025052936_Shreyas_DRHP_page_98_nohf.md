### 4. R Axis for CNC Press Brake:

An additional R Axis feature allows vertical adjustment of the back gauge that positions and supports sheet metal during bending. This capability improves efficiency in handling bends at varying heights, reduces manual adjustment, and ensures accuracy in more complex component geometries.

### 5. Forklift Truck (Jungheinrich EFG BC 320, 2T):

The forklift truck will be used for transporting, loading, and unloading materials within the production facility. With a load capacity of up to 2 tons, it will support efficient movement of raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished components over short distances, thereby improving handling efficiency and reducing manual effort.

### 6. Pallet Racking System:

The pallet racking system will be installed to provide organized and secure storage of raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished components within the production facility. It will enable efficient use of vertical space, facilitate easy access to inventory through forklifts or cranes, and improve overall material handling and workflow in the plant.
