## 5. Depreciation/Amortisation

Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on written down value basis over the estimated useful life of the assets using the indicative useful life as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except as mentioned in below table. The Company has used the following useful life to provide depreciation on property, plant and equipment:

<table><thead><tr><td>Asset Category</td><td>Useful Life (in years)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Buildings (RCC Structure)</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Factory Building</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and Machinery</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and Fixtures</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>

Intangible assets are amortised over the estimated period of economic benefits on a straight-line basis, commencing from the date the assets are available to the Company for its use.

The estimated useful life of the intangible assets and the amortisation period are reviewed at the end of each financial year, and the amortisation period is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if any. Intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal.

## 6. Impairment of Assets

The Company periodically assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and if such recoverable of the asset is less than carrying cost of the asset, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The deduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in profit and loss account.

If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed, and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to maximum of depreciable historical cost. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of asset does not exceed the net book value that would have been determined, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Due consideration is given at the balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of the company's assets as defined in Accounting Standard 28 – "Impairment of Assets" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the management is of the opinion that none of the property, plant and equipment were impaired as at the date of the Balance sheet.

## 7. Inventories

Raw materials are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. Purchased goods-in-transit are carried at cost. Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Stores and spare parts are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Finished goods produced or purchased by the Company are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct material and labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.

When there has been a decline in the price of materials and it is estimated that the cost of the finished products will exceed net realisable value, the Raw materials are written down to net realisable value. In such circumstances, the replacement cost of the materials may be the best available measure of their net realisable value.

## 8 Investments

Investments are classified into Non-current and Current Investments.
Non - current Investments are valued at cost. Provision for diminution in the value is made to recognize a decline, other than temporary, in the value of long-term investments.
Current investments are valued at cost or market value, whichever is less.
