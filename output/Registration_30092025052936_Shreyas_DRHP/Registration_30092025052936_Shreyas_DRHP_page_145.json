Diesel Engine Parts and Mounting Assemblies"}, {"bbox": [153, 221, 1501, 417], "category": "Text", "text": "A diesel engine is a type of internal combustion engine that generates mechanical power by compressing air to a high pressure and igniting diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber. These engines are widely used in generator sets, construction equipment, agricultural machinery, and heavy vehicles due to their durability and fuel efficiency. Diesel engines generate substantial vibration, torque, and thermal stress during operation, and require precision-engineered support components for reliable performance. We manufacture the following key components used in diesel engine and generator systems:"}, {"bbox": [153, 445, 1501, 611], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Coupling Brackets:** Coupling brackets are steel components that connect the output shaft of a diesel engine to driven equipment such as an alternator or gearbox. Their function is to transmit torque (a measure of rotational force) from the engine to the connected system. Without properly aligned and secure coupling, torque may not transfer efficiently, resulting in mechanical misalignment, excessive vibration, or shaft damage. Our brackets are designed to maintain precise alignment under load, reducing energy loss and preventing premature failure of rotating components."}, {"bbox": [153, 639, 1501, 804], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Base Plates:** Base plates are heavy-duty structural components that provide the foundation on which the diesel engine and ancillary equipment are mounted. During engine operation, the base plate must withstand both static weight and dynamic forces such as vibration and torque-induced movement. Uneven or improperly designed base plates can cause stress concentrations, leading to equipment misalignment or structural deformation. Our base plates are fabricated with flatness control and dimensional precision, enabling secure installation and long-term mechanical stability."}, {"bbox": [153, 834, 1501, 998], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Engine Mounts:** Engine mounts are support components that isolate the vibrations produced by the engine from the chassis or skid frame. These mounts are typically made of rubber-metal composites or machined steel depending on the application. Diesel engines produce significant vibration that, if transmitted directly to the structure, can cause metal fatigue, noise, and equipment wear. Our mounts are engineered to dampen this vibration, reduce transmitted load, and extend the service life of both the engine and support frame."}, {"bbox": [153, 1026, 1501, 1192], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Vibration Support Structures:** These are reinforcement assemblies welded or bolted onto the diesel engine base or frame to provide additional damping and load distribution. In mobile or generator-based systems, continuous operation often leads to structural fatigue. These vibration support structures reduce propagation of resonant frequencies through the chassis and stabilise the overall assembly. By improving damping and structural rigidity, they reduce the risk of cracking, distortion, or joint failure during extended duty cycles."}, {"bbox": [609, 1225, 1043, 1581], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [707, 1601, 943, 1637], "category": "Caption", "text": "Diesel Engine Parts"}, {"bbox": [153, 1644, 1030, 1681], "category": "Text", "text": "*Representative illustration depicting end-use systems in their assembled form:*"}, {"bbox": [593, 1704, 1055, 2167], "category": "Picture"}]
