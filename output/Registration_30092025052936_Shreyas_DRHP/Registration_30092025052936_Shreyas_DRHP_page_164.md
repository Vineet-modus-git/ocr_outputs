## IMPORT & EXPORT OBLIGATIONS

Our business model includes the manufacture and supply of fabricated metal components and assemblies to both domestic and international customers. As part of our international operations, we export select product categories to customers located in the United States of America and Czech Republic. These exports primarily consist of Hot Dip Galvanized telecom parts, which are manufactured at our facilities in Nashik, Maharashtra and dispatched under client-specific packing, documentation, and logistical arrangements.

We currently export on an Ex Works (EXW)¹ basis, wherein buyers or their agents assume responsibility for transportation, customs clearance, and delivery from our premises. The commercial invoice is prepared in-house to facilitate export compliance. Our exports are transacted in US Dollar (US$) and, as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have a formal hedging policy in place to manage foreign exchange exposure through arrangements with the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS).
