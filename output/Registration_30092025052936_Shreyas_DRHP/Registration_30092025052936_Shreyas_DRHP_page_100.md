## Justification for Holding Period Levels

<table><tr><td>Inventory</td><td>Inventories include raw materials, WIP and finished goods. The Inventory levels are maintained by our Company depending upon the demand and delivery schedules of that particular order. Inventory holding period increased to 38 days in F.Y. 2023-24 as compared to 17 days in F.Y. 2022-23 reason being strategic decisions driven by factors like exploring export markets. Inventory holding period decreased significantly to 24 days in F.Y. 2024-25 as compared to 38 days in F.Y. 2023-24. Our expected inventory holding period for the years ended March 31, 2026, and March 31, 2027, are 20 days and 27 days respectively. This higher inventory holding period is essential to maintain our competitive edge. A higher holding period is crucial to maintain competitive advantage, particularly in the defence and heavy manufacturing sector, where longer project cycles and casting requirements directly impact inventory levels.</td></tr><tr><td>Trade Receivable</td><td>Trade receivable days decreased, from 82 days in FY2023 to 66 days in FY2024 and further to 65 days in FY2025. These allowing customers extended credit periods to support long-term relationships and large-scale contracts. This approach enhances customer retention and provides flexibility, though it moderately impacts cash flow cycles. The decrease in receivable days is therefore a deliberate business decision to fuel growth in both domestic and export markets. However, this stricter approach led to moderated sales, prompting the company to consider relaxing credit terms in the future to drive business expansion, the company projects an increase in trade receivable days to 76 days of total revenue for FY2026 and 74 days for FY2027. This strategic decision is intended to boost sales growth by offering customers extended credit periods, providing them with greater flexibility to settle invoices.</td></tr><tr><td>Other Current Assets</td><td>Other current assets include advances to employees, balance with Government Authorities for GST, duty draw back receivables and other balances with revenue authorities. Our Other current assets holding period for the F.Y. 2022-23 and 2023-24 were 48 days and 37 days respectively which was further reduced to 22 days in F.Y</td></tr></table>
