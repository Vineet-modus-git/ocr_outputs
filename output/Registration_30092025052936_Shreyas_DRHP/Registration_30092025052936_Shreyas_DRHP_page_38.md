3. We have experienced significant working capital requirements in past and may continue to experience in future also. If we experience insufficient cash flows from our operations or are unable to borrow to meet our working capital requirements, it may materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, cash flows and results of operations.

Working capital is critical for financing project execution, managing inventory, and procuring raw materials, and we anticipate similar requirements going forward. Any adverse changes, such as delays in customer payments, unfavorable credit terms, or extended receivable cycles, may put pressure on our working capital position, resulting in reduced cash flows and increased reliance on external funding. Further, factors such as delays in loan disbursements, higher interest rates, increased insurance costs, or restrictions on borrowing and lending may constrain our ability to adequately finance working capital needs. Any such circumstances could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition, revenues, and future prospects.

The Working capital requirement based on the special purpose combined financials for the financial year ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 as per Restated financial statement is as follows:

(Rs. In Lakhs)

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="3">For the Financial year ended on</th></tr><tr><th>March 31, 2025</th><th>March 31, 2024</th><th>March 31, 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total Current Assets (I)</td><td>2,600.25</td><td>2,011.68</td><td>1,158.50</td></tr><tr><td>Total Current Liabilities (II)</td><td>770.24</td><td>786.51</td><td>595.87</td></tr><tr><td>Net Working Capital (I)- (II)</td><td>1,830.01</td><td>1,225.17</td><td>562.63</td></tr></tbody></table>

We continually strive to enhance our financial management practices to effectively address working capital challenges. By closely monitoring credit terms, payment schedules, we aim to mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in working capital requirements. Additionally, prudent financial planning, exploring diverse financing options, and maintaining strong relationships with financial institutions are key factors in managing our working capital efficiently. Despite our proactive measures, there can be no assurance that working capital fluctuations will not impact our business operations or financial performance.

4. Under-utilization of our manufacturing capacities and an inability to effectively utilize our expanded manufacturing capacities could have an adverse effect on our business, future prospects and future financial performance.

Our capacity utilization levels are dependent on our ability to carry out uninterrupted operations at manufacturing facilities, the availability of raw materials, industry/ market conditions, as well as by the product requirements of, and procurement practice followed by, our dealers. In the event we face prolonged disruptions at our facilities including due to interruptions in the supply of water, electricity or as a result of labour unrest, or are unable to procure sufficient raw materials, we would not be able to achieve full capacity utilization of our current manufacturing facilities, resulting in operational inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, we have made certain investments for the expansion of our manufacturing capacities in the past and intend to use a part of the Net Proceeds towards expansion of our manufacturing facilities, specifically at our manufacturing facility.
