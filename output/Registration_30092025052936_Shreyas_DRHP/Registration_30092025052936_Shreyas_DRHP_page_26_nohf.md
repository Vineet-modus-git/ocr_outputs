All statements contained in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements. All statements regarding our expected financial condition and results of operations, business, plans and prospects are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our business strategy, our revenue and profitability, our projects and other matters discussed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus regarding matters that are not historical facts.

All forward looking statements (whether made by us or any third party) are predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward-looking statement.

Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are not a guarantee of future performance. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect.
