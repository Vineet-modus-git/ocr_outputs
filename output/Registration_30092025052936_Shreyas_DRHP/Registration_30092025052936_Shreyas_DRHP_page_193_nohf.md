**What Constitutes Sexual Harassment?**

Sexual Harassment means such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (directly or through implication), like physical contact and advances by the employee(s) including:

a) A demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, any other unwelcome physical conduct of sexual nature, lurid stares, physical contact or molestation, stalking, sounds, display of pictures, signs;

b) Eve teasing, innuendos and taunts, physical confinement against one's will;

c) A demand or request for sexual favours, whether verbally or non-verbally, where the submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or promotion / evaluation of work thereby denying an individual equal opportunity at employment;

d) An act or conduct by a person in authority which makes the environment at workplace hostile or intimidating to a person or unreasonably interferes with the individual's privacy and productivity at work;

e) Verbal harassment of a sexual nature, such as lewd comments, sexual jokes or references, and offensive personal references; demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive comments (oral or written) about an individual's personal appearance or electronically transmitted messages (Jokes, remarks, letters, phone calls);

f) Any other behaviour which an individual perceives as having sexual overtones.

**Redressal Mechanism:**

Once the complaint is received by the Committee:

a) The person who is accused by the complainant will be informed that a complaint has been filed against him (he will be made aware of the details of the allegation and also the name of the complainant as it would be necessary for proper inquiry) and no unfair acts of retaliation or unethical action will be tolerated.
