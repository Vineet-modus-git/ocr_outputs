The International Monetary Fund projects world output to expand by 3.0 percent in 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, reflecting a slight upward revision from earlier forecasts due to stronger trade activity, lower effective tariff rates, and improved financial conditions. Headline inflation is expected to decline to 4.2 percent in 2025 and 3.6 percent in 2026, although outcomes vary across economies, with the United States likely to remain above target while the euro area and several emerging markets experience more subdued pressures. Downside risks remain prominent, including the possibility of renewed tariff escalation, continued geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and rising fiscal vulnerabilities in advanced economies. Such developments could disrupt global supply chains, elevate commodity prices, and tighten financial conditions. Conversely, constructive trade agreements and credible fiscal consolidation could restore predictability, foster investment, and provide a stronger base for medium term growth."}, {"bbox": [355, 1780, 1300, 1819], "category": "Caption", "text": "World Economic Outlook - Real GDP growth (in %) - International Monetary Fund"}, {"bbox": [227, 1836, 1382, 2123], "category": "Picture"}]
