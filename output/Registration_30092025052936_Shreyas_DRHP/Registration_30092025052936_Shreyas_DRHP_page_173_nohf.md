## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGISLATIONS

In general, the Intellectual Property Rights includes but is not limited to the following enactments:

* Indian Copyright Act, 1957
* The Trademarks Act, 1999
* The Designs Act, 2000
* The Patent Act, 1970

The acts applicable to our Company will be:

### Trademarks Act, 1999 ("TM Act")

The TM Act, 1999 provides for the application and registration of trademarks in India for granting exclusive rights to marks such as a brand, label and heading and obtaining relief in case of infringement for commercial purposes as a trade description. The TM Act prohibits any registration of deceptively similar trademarks or chemical compounds among others. It also provides for penalties for infringement, falsifying and falsely applying for trademarks.

### Copyright Act, 1957 ("Copyright Act")

The Copyright Act, 1957, along with the Copyright Rules, 1958, (collectively, "Copyright Laws") governs copyrights subsisting in original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, cinematograph films, and sound recordings, including computer programmes, tables and compilations including computer databases. Computer programme constitutes a literary work under Indian law and is afforded copyright protection and the owner of such computer programme becomes entitled to protect his works against unauthorized use and misappropriation of the copyrighted work or a substantial part thereof. Any act of this nature entitles the copyright owner to obtain relief from a court of law including injunction, damages and accounts of profits. Further, copyright registration is not a prerequisite for acquiring or enforcing a copyright in an otherwise copyrightable work and once registered, copyright protection remains valid until expiry of sixty years from the demise of the author. Reproduction of a copyrighted computer programme for sale or hire or trade exhibit in public or distribution or commercial rental, offer for sale or commercial rental, issuing copy(ies) of the computer programme or making an adaptation of the work without consent of the copyright owner amounts to infringement of the copyright. However, the Copyright Act prescribes certain fair use exceptions which permit certain acts, which would otherwise be considered copyright infringement.

### The Patents Act, 1970

The Patents Act, 1970 ("Patents Act") governs the patent regime in India. Being a signatory to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, India is required to recognize product patents as well as process patents. In addition to the broad requirement that an invention satisfy the requirements of novelty, utility and non-obviousness in order for it to avail patent protection, the Patents Act further provides that patent protection may not be granted to certain specified types of inventions and materials even if they satisfy the above criteria. Section 39 of the Patents Act also prohibits any person resident in India from applying for a patent for an invention outside India without making an application for a patent for the same invention in India. The term of a patent granted under the Patents Act pursuant to Section 53 is for a period of twenty years from the date of filing of the application for the patent. A patent shall cease to have effect if the renewal fee is not paid within the period prescribed for the payment of such renewal fee. While the Patents Act prohibits patentability of a 'computer programme' as such, computer programmes in combination with novel hardware could be considered patentable depending on the substance of the invention and applicable provisions of the Patents Act. Computer programmes on their own are excluded from patent protection and are protected as a literary work under the Copyright Laws. In terms of the Patent Act, the patentee holds the exclusive right to prevent third parties from the using, offering for sale, selling or importing for such purposes, the patented product or product obtained directly by a process patented in India.

## ANTI-TRUST LAWS

### Competition Act, 2002 (the "Act")

The Act is to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition, to promote and sustain competition in markets, to protect interest of consumer and to ensure freedom of trade in India. The Act deals with prohibition of anti-competitive agreements. No enterprise or group shall abuse its dominant position in various circumstances as mentioned under the Act.
