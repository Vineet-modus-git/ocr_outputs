[{"bbox": [151, 150, 1499, 1219], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><td>Risk Category</td><td>Risk Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Macroeconomic</td><td><strong>Capital Expenditure Cyclicality:</strong> The industry's growth is inextricably linked to capital formation in infrastructure. Delays or contraction in government-led programs due to fiscal tightening or political transitions may significantly affect order visibility.<br/><strong>Commodity Price Volatility:</strong> Fabricators are exposed to fluctuations in steel and aluminium prices, which may compress margins in fixed-price contracts or delay procurement cycles.<br/><strong>Interest Rate Environment:</strong> Elevated interest rates can impair access to affordable working capital, particularly for MSMEs, limiting their ability to scale operations or execute long-tenure contracts.</td></tr><tr><td>Operational</td><td><strong>Underutilization of Capacity:</strong> Volatile project inflows or execution delays may result in suboptimal capacity utilization, undermining profitability and asset turnover ratios.<br/><strong>Execution Risk:</strong> Delays in land acquisition, clearances, or civil work timelines can impact fabrication schedules and lead to contractual penalties or receivables mismatches.<br/><strong>Skilled Manpower Shortage:</strong> Scarcity of certified welders, fitters, and project engineers—particularly in non-urban clusters—can affect adherence to quality norms and delivery timelines.</td></tr><tr><td>Regulatory</td><td><strong>Environmental Compliance:</strong> Fabrication units fall under pollution control oversight; non-compliance with emission, effluent, or safety norms may result in regulatory action or site closures.<br/><strong>Certification Constraints:</strong> Inability to secure or renew project-specific certifications (e.g., RDSO, BIS, ISO) can disqualify firms from participating in large public tenders.</td></tr><tr><td>Client Concentration</td><td><strong>Government Tender Dependence:</strong> Over-reliance on government contracts exposes firms to procedural inefficiencies, delayed payments, and policy-driven shifts in procurement priorities.<br/><strong>Receivables Stretch:</strong> Infrastructure-linked projects often follow milestone-based payments, resulting in elongated receivable cycles that may strain liquidity.</td></tr><tr><td>Competitive and Technological</td><td><strong>Technology Obsolescence:</strong> Firms failing to invest in automation, precision tooling, or digital integration risk lagging on productivity and cost-efficiency.<br/><strong>Market Fragmentation:</strong> The presence of numerous small-scale and regional fabricators contributes to price undercutting, impacting industry-wide margin profiles.</td></tr></tbody></table>"}]
