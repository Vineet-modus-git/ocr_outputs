## 5. Toolroom and Die Maintenance

Our in-house toolroom is equipped to design, develop, and maintain all critical tooling required for production, enabling faster turnaround, reduced downtime, and minimal external dependency. Key capabilities include:

**Press Tools and Dies:** Custom-built tooling used in stamping, deep drawing, and bending operations to shape sheet metal components with precision and consistency.

**Forming Moulds:** Specialized moulds developed for shaping or contouring operations, particularly where non-flat geometries or compound curves are involved.

**Welding Jigs and Assembly Fixtures:** Precision-engineered supports used to hold parts in fixed positions during welding and assembly, ensuring accurate alignment and dimensional repeatability across batches.

**Special Purpose Machine (SPM) Development and Maintenance:** Design, fabrication, and upkeep of product-specific or operation-specific machines that automate complex or repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency in large-volume or geometry-specific production.

## 6. Utilities and Infrastructure

Our production facilities are equipped with the utilities and infrastructure necessary to support heavy fabrication and multi-shift operations.

**Overhead Cranes (5T to 10T):** Installed across shopfloors to handle heavy fabricated sub-assemblies and raw material movement.

**Compressed Air, Dust Extraction and Ventilation:** Integrated to ensure environmental safety, process stability, and operator comfort.

These support systems are embedded into the manufacturing workflow to ensure operational continuity and compliance with industrial safety norms.
