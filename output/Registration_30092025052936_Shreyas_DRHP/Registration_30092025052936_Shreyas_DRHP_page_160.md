## 2. Strengthening Working Capital Position:

A portion of the net proceeds is also proposed to be utilized for meeting our working capital requirements. The fabrication industry is often characterized by extended project lead times—covering design iterations, development of jigs and dies, profiling, production, and final delivery—coupled with high raw material costs. By strengthening our working capital base, we seek to secure greater flexibility to manage these project cycles, maintain optimal inventory, and take on larger orders. This will not only enhance our execution capability but also reinforce client confidence in our ability to deliver on time and to specification.

## 3. Client Consolidation, Market Expansion and Entry into Higher-Value Segments:

We are already serving industry-leading clients, and our strategic focus is to consolidate our position with them by consistently delivering quality, reducing lead times, and improving cost efficiency. These established relationships act as a strong benchmark for credibility, which we aim to leverage in approaching other marquee players across industries. In addition, we plan to expand into higher-value fabrication segments by showcasing the breadth of our capabilities in precision engineering, complex assemblies, and high-specification products. This transition is expected to enhance our product mix, drive margin accretion, and strengthen our competitive positioning in the evolving fabrication landscape.

# MARKETING STRATEGY

Our business benefits from continuing relationships with our existing customers, many of whom have engaged with us for multiple years. These associations are reinforced by our consistent adherence to quality standards, timely delivery, and cost efficiency. In addition, our Promoters bring longstanding industry connect and a reputation for reliability, which have been instrumental in fostering client trust and securing repeat business. We believe these factors position us strongly to maintain and expand our customer base going forward.

# OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

We believe that the following are our primary competitive strengths:

## In-House Tooling and Fixturing Capability Enabling Flexible Manufacturing

We design, develop, and maintain all critical press tooling, jigs, and assembly fixtures in-house, enabling tighter integration between product design, process control, and quality assurance. This capability allows for accelerated iteration during the development phase, where our engineering team proactively incorporates accurate mechanisms which are and precision alignment to safeguard critical component dimensions. In-house control over tooling infrastructure reduces reliance on third-party vendors, thereby significantly compressing lead times for tool modifications, enabling rapid validation cycles, significantly reducing costs, and minimizing production disruptions due to tool maintenance or replacement.

This operational independence not only enhances our responsiveness to customer-specific requirements but also supports the continuous improvement of manufacturing processes through the implementation of LEAN methodologies such as Kaizen and DSI practices. At a scale where most fabrication companies typically outsource tool development due to capital and technical constraints, our ability to manage this function internally reflects a higher degree of manufacturing maturity and contributes directly to the consistency, repeatability, and quality of our output.

## Commitment to Quality and ISO 9001 Certification

We hold an ISO 9001 certification, which affirms the presence of a structured and independently audited Quality Management System within our operations. This certification reflects our adherence to documented processes, stringent quality controls, and continuous oversight across the entire production lifecycle. We deploy dedicated quality assurance resources at every stage -from the inspection of incoming raw material to final output; to ensure strict conformity to customer specifications and maintain consistent quality standards.

Our processes are engineered with application-specific fixturing and special-purpose machines, purpose-built to minimize human error and enhance operational reliability. As a result, we have consistently achieved a Zero Parts Per Million (0 PPM*) defect rate with the majority of our customers, signifying the complete absence of product defects across delivered batches. In recognition of this performance, we have received Quality and Overall Superior Performance Awards repeatedly from one of our key customers.
