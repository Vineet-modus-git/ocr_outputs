Pursuant to the UPI Circulars, the UPI Mechanism has been introduced in a phased manner as a payment mechanism (in addition to mechanism of blocking funds in the account maintained with SCSBs under the ASBA) for applications by RIBs through intermediaries with the objective to reduce the time duration from public Offer closure to listing from six working days to up to three working days.

Under this phase, submission of the ASBA Form by RIBs through Designated Intermediaries (other than SCSBs) to SCSBs for blocking of funds will be discontinued and will be replaced by the UPI payment mechanism.
