**Basis of Preparation and Restriction on Distribution and Use**

Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to annexure no. 4 (a) & (b) to these Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements, which describe the basis of preparation. The financial statements are prepared solely for use in relation to the preparation of the Offer Document of Shreyas Fabtech Limited to be filed with the SEBI, NSE Emerge, and the RoC in connection with the proposed IPO of the Issuer. As a result, the Special Purpose Combined Financial Statements may not be suitable for any other purpose. Our report is intended solely for the Issuer and statutory auditors of the Issuer for use in connection with the above purpose and should not be distributed to or used by parties without our prior written consent.
