**Note:** *MIG (Metal Inert Gas) and TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) are two common arc welding methods used in industrial fabrication. MIG is preferred for speed and versatility, while TIG offers greater precision and cleaner welds. Both are essential for handling different material types and thicknesses in engineered assemblies.

## 5. Surface Finishing

Post-weld assemblies are surface treated based on customer requirements:

**Hot-Dip Galvanizing:** Performed through job work by trusted external and vendors. Components are immersed in molten zinc to ensure long-term corrosion resistance. This process is primarily applied to telecom and infrastructure products exposed to environmental conditions.

**Powder Coating:** Carried out through third-party certified vendors under our supervision for components requiring aesthetic finishes or electrical insulation.

**Painting:** Conducted in-house using conventional liquid painting methods where specified.

Surface finishing is followed by drying, curing, and final inspection for coating thickness and uniformity.

## 6. Final Inspection and Quality Checks

Before dispatch, all finished components undergo:

**Dimensional inspection** using gauges and fixtures

**Weld strength and visual checks**

**Salt spray testing and coating adhesion verification** (for galvanized or coated parts)

**Assembly fitment checks** (where required)

We maintain documented records of inspection data, customer approvals, and batch traceability.

## 7. Packing and Dispatch

Approved products are packed using custom-designed packaging to prevent transit damage. Packing methods vary by component type and include wooden crates, metal pallets, shrink wrapping, or corrugated boxes. Dispatches are planned in coordination with customer schedules and logistics partners.

# MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES

Our manufacturing operations are supported by an integrated ecosystem of precision machinery, skilled manpower, and quality-controlled workflows. This infrastructure enables us to deliver engineered fabricated components across a diverse product mix with consistency, dimensional accuracy, and cost efficiency. Our facilities are designed to handle medium- to high-volume production while accommodating customer-specific configurations.

## 1. Cutting and Material Processing

We operate a range of computer-controlled cutting systems to process mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminium sheets into pre-cut metal pieces These operations form the first stage of fabrication and are critical in ensuring dimensional conformity in downstream processes.

**Laser Cutting:** Enables high-precision cutting of thin to medium gauge materials using a focused laser beam for fine edges and minimal post-processing.

**Plasma Cutting:** Utilizes a high-velocity jet of ionized gas to rapidly cut through thicker, electrically conductive metals with speed and efficiency.

**Gas Cutting (Oxy-Fuel):** Suitable for high-volume cutting of heavy mild steel plates where throughput is prioritized over surface finish.

**Shearing:** Applied for straight-line cutting of sheet metal, particularly in preparatory blanking for press operations.

**Band Sawing:** Used for linear cutting of bars, pipes, C-channels, and structural steel sections for length-specific requirements.
