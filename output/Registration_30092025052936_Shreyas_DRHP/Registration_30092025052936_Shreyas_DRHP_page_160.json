Strengthening Working Capital Position:\n\nA portion of the net proceeds is also proposed to be utilized for meeting our working capital requirements. The fabrication industry is often characterized by extended project lead times—covering design iterations, development of jigs and dies, profiling, production, and final delivery—coupled with high raw material costs. By strengthening our working capital base, we seek to secure greater flexibility to manage these project cycles, maintain optimal inventory, and take on larger orders. This will not only enhance our execution capability but also reinforce client confidence in our ability to deliver on time and to specification."}, {"bbox": [151, 458, 1166, 497], "category": "List-item", "text": "## 3.
