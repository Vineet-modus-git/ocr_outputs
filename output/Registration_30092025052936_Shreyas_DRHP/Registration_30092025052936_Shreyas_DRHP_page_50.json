A high employee attrition rate can significantly disrupt our business operations and hinder overall performance.**\nEmployee turnover can disrupt operations, hinder our ability to scale effectively, and undermine investor confidence. The departure of key personnel may result in the loss of critical knowledge, experience, and relationships that are integral to the company's success. This could lead to delays in product development, operational inefficiencies, and diminished performance, which may negatively affect our financial results and growth prospects. Additionally, a high turnover rate can elevate recruitment and training costs, diverting resources that could otherwise be invested in enhancing business operations. As we move forward with our IPO, ensuring stability within our workforce is crucial to maintaining strong market perception, meeting strategic goals, and driving long-term growth.
