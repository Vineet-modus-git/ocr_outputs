The list of items under the Act include drugs, fertilizers, pulses and edible oils, and petroleum and petroleum products. The Union Government can include new commodities as and when the need arises and take them off the list once the situation improves. If the Union Government finds that a certain commodity is in short supply and its price is spiking, Union Government can notify stock-holding limits on it for a specified period. The States act on this notification to specify limits and take steps to ensure that these are adhered to. Anybody trading or dealing in the commodity, be it wholesalers, retailers or even importers are prevented from stockpiling it beyond a certain quantity. A State can, however, choose not to impose any restrictions. But once it does, traders have to immediately sell into the market any stocks held beyond the mandated quantity.
