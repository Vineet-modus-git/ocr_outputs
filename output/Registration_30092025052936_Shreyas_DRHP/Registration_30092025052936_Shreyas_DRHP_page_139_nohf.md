## Rail-based Transit Sector

India's sustained investment in rail-based mass transit systems marks a pivotal structural theme within the country's infrastructure development strategy, with clear implications for the domestic metal fabrication sector. As the central mode of public transport, rail infrastructure spanning intercity lines, metro networks, and freight corridors forms the core of planned connectivity enhancements. The growing focus on high-capacity, low-emission transport solutions is generating consistent, large-scale demand for industrially fabricated steel and aluminium components required across various project stages.

As of FY2025, India operates over 1,000 km of metro rail and has commissioned more than 70,000 km of electrified railway lines. Looking ahead, government-led infrastructure programs spanning the National Rail Plan (NRP), PM Gati Shakti, and the Metro Rail Policy target extensive additions across both passenger and freight segments over the next five years. This trajectory is expected to sustain high-volume demand for fabricated steel and aluminium assemblies critical to project execution.

Between FY2024 and FY2030, total capital outlay across rail-based transit systems is projected to exceed ₹12 lakh crore (USD ~144 billion), as per cumulative targets of the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, and allied urban transport authorities. The following high-level developments outline the scale of opportunity:

* Indian Railways plans to add over 25,000 km of new lines and convert 100% of its broad-gauge network to electric traction by FY2030. Station redevelopment programs, signalling upgrades, and procurement of Vande Bharat trainsets further necessitate large-scale fabrication.
* Urban Mass Transit will see cumulative metro and regional rapid transit (RRTS) corridors expand to over 2,500 km by FY2030, up from ~1,000 km currently. More than 20 Tier-I and Tier-II cities are covered under sanctioned and proposed metro projects.
* Dedicated Freight Corridors, under the aegis of DFCCIL, will add over 3,300 km of high-capacity freight-only routes, with additional corridors under planning to cover industrial and mining belts

Taken together, these infrastructure initiatives are expected to generate cumulative demand for fabricated steel and aluminium components running into several million tonnes. The requirement spans a diverse array of applications:

## 4. Risk Factors

The metal fabrication industry in India, while structurally positioned to benefit from large-scale public infrastructure initiatives, remains exposed to a range of macroeconomic, operational, regulatory, and competitive risks. The materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact capacity utilization, margin realization, or long-term sustainability.
