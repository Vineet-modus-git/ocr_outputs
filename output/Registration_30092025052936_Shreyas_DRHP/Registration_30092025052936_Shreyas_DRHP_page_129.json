Conversely, sustained softness in raw material prices, if not accompanied by proportional demand weakening, can expand mill margins and encourage volume growth. The degree of price elasticity also varies by region. In India, for example, the presence of captive iron ore (by companies such as Tata Steel and SAIL) can partially buffer global iron ore volatility, while coking coal exposure remains a key vulnerability."}, {"bbox": [150, 539, 1501, 641], "category": "Text", "text": "While input costs provide directional guidance, steel prices also reflect independent supply-demand dynamics, trade policy interventions, and downstream sector performance.

Its unique combination of light weight, corrosion resistance, conductivity, and recyclability has made it indispensable to both mature and emerging economies. Unlike steel, which is primarily derived from iron ore and coal, aluminium production is driven by the refining of bauxite into alumina, followed by smelting through energy-intensive electrolytic processes. This renders aluminium pricing particularly sensitive to power costs—especially in regions where smelters depend on grid electricity or fossil fuel-based captive generation. Over the past decade, aluminium has transitioned from being a surplus commodity to one increasingly governed by supply chain risks, geopolitical trade dynamics, and decarbonization policies. With China controlling over 55% of global aluminium output and a growing emphasis on green aluminium from hydropower-fed smelters in Canada, India, and the Nordics, the commodity's price evolution is now equally a function of policy, power, and carbon premiums, as it is of traditional supply-demand fundamentals. In this context, tracking aluminium prices through LME spot benchmarks and input cost trends (bauxite, alumina, energy) becomes vital for understanding the economic viability and strategic positioning of midstream and downstream producers."}, {"bbox": [150, 1180, 389, 1216], "category": "Caption", "text": "Aluminium pricing"}, {"bbox": [157, 1240, 1502, 1837], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [150, 1864, 354, 1897], "category": "Text", "text": "*Source: TradingView*"}, {"bbox": [150, 1923, 1501, 2121], "category": "Text", "text": "Aluminium prices, as measured on a USD per tonne basis, exhibited considerable volatility over the past year, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic shifts, supply-side disruptions, and energy-related cost dynamics. In the initial months from April to mid-June 2024, prices hovered in the range of USD 2,500–2,700/tonne, supported by restocking demand and constrained global smelter output, particularly in Europe, where elevated electricity costs continued to impede full capacity utilization. However, by late June through August 2024, prices declined sharply, touching a yearly low of approximately USD 2,250/tonne.
