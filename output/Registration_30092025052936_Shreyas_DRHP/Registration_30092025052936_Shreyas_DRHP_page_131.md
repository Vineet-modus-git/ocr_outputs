However, from late 2023 through early 2025, this correlation appears to have weakened. Despite a sharp fall in coal prices, aluminium prices remained relatively elevated through Q1 2025 before their recent decline. Several structural and situational factors explain this divergence. Firstly, aluminium prices during this period were influenced more by non-energy-related supply disruptions, such as smelter curtailments in China's Yunnan province due to hydro shortages, logistical bottlenecks affecting bauxite exports from Guinea, and geopolitical tensions disrupting maritime trade. These supply constraints kept aluminium prices high even as thermal coal markets corrected on the back of improved inventory, reduced winter demand, and a shift in Europe and China's generation mix.

Secondly, the divergence is partially explained by the ongoing decarbonisation shift in developed economies. The EU, US, and Canada have increasingly transitioned away from coal in favour of renewable and nuclear energy. This decouples aluminium pricing from coal in these regions, especially where smelters are being retrofitted to run on hydro or wind-based captive power (e.g., Norway, Canada). Consequently, global aluminium prices—while still partly driven by coal— are increasingly being influenced by renewables-linked production in developed economies, making coal-aluminium correlation more region-specific.

In contrast, India remains critically exposed to coal-based energy for aluminium production. The correlation remains highly relevant in the Indian context due to three key reasons: (1) a high dependence on captive coal-fired power in smelting operations; (2) frequent volatility in domestic coal logistics and railway availability; and (3) import dependency for high-calorific-value coal from Indonesia and Australia, which affects cost competitiveness. According to CRISIL and ICRA, a 10% spike in coal prices can increase aluminium production costs in India by nearly 5%, exerting direct pressure on margins, especially for integrated producers without fuel linkages.

# 3. Metal Fabricating Industry

## 3.1 Industry Definition and Scope

### Overview and Fundamentals

The metal fabricating industry refers to a downstream, value-added manufacturing segment engaged in processing base metal inputs i.e. primarily steel and aluminium into structurally and functionally customized components and assemblies. The industry converts flat-rolled, long, or cast metal forms into usable parts through a sequential array of thermal, mechanical, and chemical processes, such as cutting, bending, machining, welding, and surface finishing.

Metal fabricators typically transform raw materials (such as hot-rolled coils, aluminium extrusions, or steel plates) using specialized equipment and tooling setups, into intermediate products (e.g., enclosures, frames, housings) or end-use assemblies (e.g., structural beams, chassis modules, equipment mounts) that are tailored to client specifications and compliance requirements.

The industry plays a critical link between commodity producers (e.g., primary metal manufacturers) and end-user sectors by enabling:

* Dimensional conversion (sizing, shaping),
* Mechanical adaptation (strengthening, welding, joining),
* Surface and corrosion resistance (coating, galvanizing, anodizing),
* Functional integration (assembly, modular design).

### Key Characteristics of the Metal Fabricating Industry

The metal fabricating industry is inherently capital intensive, requiring substantial upfront investments in plant infrastructure, CNC machinery, press brakes, welding stations, and finishing lines. The production process is heavily machinery driven, with a strong dependence on precision equipment and skilled technical labour. Given its reliance on core commodities such as steel and aluminium, the industry is prone to input price volatility, where margins are sensitive to fluctuations in global commodity markets. This exposure is often mitigated through hedging mechanisms or contractual pass-through arrangements with customers.

Fabrication demand is also cyclically linked to broader macroeconomic and infrastructure investment trends, particularly in sectors like construction, automotive, industrial machinery, and power generation. During upcycles, order volumes rise due to increased capital formation and project activity, whereas downturns often lead to capacity underutilization and margin compression. The industry is typically highly customized, especially in mid- to high-end applications, where fabricators must deliver low-to-medium volume, high-complexity products tailored to specific client drawings and
