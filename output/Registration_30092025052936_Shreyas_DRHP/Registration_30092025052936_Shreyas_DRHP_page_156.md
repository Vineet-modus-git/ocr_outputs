These systems are designed to handle a range of material thicknesses and geometries, enabling flexible lot sizes and minimizing material wastage.

## 2. Pressing and Forming

This stage involves shaping flat-cut blanks into formed parts, functional features, or deep-drawn geometries. The process includes high-speed presswork, controlled deep drawing, and precision bending, depending on part requirements.

**Mechanical Pressing:** Used for stamping, punching, notching, and light- to medium-gauge bending in high-volume applications.

**Hydraulic Deep Drawing:** Enables the formation of cylindrical and box-type components up to moderate thicknesses, without welding or joints, thus enhancing structural integrity.

**Rolling and Structural Bending:** Used for forming curved profiles and circular shapes, including through imported structural rolling equipment for higher precision forming.

**Press Braking:** Applied for multi-axis bending and angular forming of sheets requiring tight dimensional tolerances.

All press tools and forming dies are developed in-house, ensuring tooling compatibility with customer drawings and production repeatability.

## 3. Welding and Assembly

Welding operations are performed to join cut or formed parts into sub-assemblies, frames, or finished structures. The process is tailored based on geometry complexity, required joint strength, and production volume.

**Manual MIG and TIG Welding:** Operated by AWS-certified* welders for assemblies requiring operator-controlled deposition and custom alignment.

**Robotic Welding Arms:** Employed for consistent, high-throughput welding of geometrically repetitive or large-batch assemblies.

**Special Purpose Welding Machines (SPMs):** Engineered for product-specific operations involving multi-point or simultaneous welding, increasing efficiency and consistency.

Our welding infrastructure enables us to address a wide spectrum of weld types, joint conditions, and finishing standards.

*Note: "AWS" refers to the American Welding Society, a globally recognized authority on welding standards and certifications. AWS certification is a formal credential awarded to welding professionals who demonstrate proficiency in industry-specified procedures and techniques. In industrial fabrication, employing AWS-certified welders ensures adherence to internationally accepted weld quality, strength, and safety norms. This certification is particularly valued in sectors such as infrastructure, power equipment, telecom, and process automation, where weld integrity is critical to performance and regulatory compliance.*

## 4. Surface Finishing

Post-weld assemblies undergo surface treatments depending on their end-use environment and technical requirements. These treatments improve corrosion resistance, durability, and finish quality.

**Hot-Dip Galvanizing:** Executed through external vendors. Components are immersed in molten zinc to create a bonded protective coating. This process is particularly critical for telecom and infrastructure parts exposed to outdoor or coastal conditions.

**Powder Coating:** Performed through third-party vendors for parts requiring an aesthetic finish, added durability, or surface insulation.

**Liquid Painting:** Conducted in-house for components where conventional coating is sufficient or where powder coating is not specified.

All coated parts are subjected to drying, curing, and inspection to verify adhesion, finish quality, and film thickness.
