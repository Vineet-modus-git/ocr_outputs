As a semi-finished flat steel product, HRC serves as the upstream feedstock for a broad array of value-added products, including cold-rolled coil, galvanized sheets, welded tubes, and structural steel. Its ubiquity across end-use sectors i.e. construction, automotive, capital goods, and heavy engineering makes it a reliable barometer for steel demand and pricing power. Further, HRC is the most liquid steel contract on commodity exchanges (notably CME for US Midwest HRC) and is frequently used in procurement pricing mechanisms and hedging strategies. Given its high correlation with upstream inputs such as iron ore and coking coal, and downstream offtake volumes, HRC also enables effective benchmarking for market participants across geographies, including India, where trade parity pricing and mill-level realization are closely aligned with international trends."}, {"bbox": [152, 1264, 338, 1300], "category": "Text", "text": "### Price trajectory"}, {"bbox": [152, 1329, 1500, 1588], "category": "Text", "text": "Between April 2024 and April 2025, HRC prices moved through three distinct phases. The period from April to September 2024 was characterized by a sustained decline, with prices falling from approximately USD 870/tonne in April to sub-USD 670/tonne levels by September. This correction was driven by a combination of weak steel demand in China attributable to protracted weakness in real estate and delayed infrastructure spending and an inventory overhang across key producing regions. Additionally, iron ore prices fell from USD 125/tonne to USD 100/tonne during the same period, as seaborne supply normalized, and Chinese steel output remained constrained. A restrictive global monetary environment, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank maintaining high interest rates, further dampened activity in steel-intensive sectors."}, {"bbox": [152, 1616, 1500, 1812], "category": "Text", "text": "The subsequent phase, from October 2024 to January 2025, marked a period of relative stabilization, with HRC prices moving within a narrow range of USD 680-740/tonne. Seasonal demand support from infrastructure-led restocking in Southeast Asia and the Middle East provided a floor, while production curbs in China's northern provinces particularly Hebei and Shanxi temporarily tightened supply. Meanwhile, trade protections in the European Union, such as the continuation of steel import quotas and anti-dumping measures, helped maintain local market discipline despite underlying demand softness."}, {"bbox": [152, 1839, 1500, 2005], "category": "Text", "text": "The final leg, spanning February to April 2025, saw a sharp rebound in HRC prices, which rallied to a high of USD 950/tonne in late March before settling around USD 932/tonne in April. This surge was led by pre-seasonal restocking in China post-Lunar New Year, renewed infrastructure acceleration in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, and robust raw material inflation, with iron ore and coking coal rebounding to USD 120/tonne and USD 310/tonne respectively.

The absence of a large-scale stimulus and intermittent capacity controls introduced volatility into both supply and demand expectations. Second, input"}]
