### (iii) Sensitivity analysis

Significant estimates: Sensitivity of actuarial assumptions

The sensitivity of the provision for defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>Year ended<br>31-Mar-25</th><th>Year ended<br>31-Mar-24</th><th>Year ended<br>31-Mar-23</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Impact of +1% Change in Rate of Discounting</td><td>(5.97)</td><td>(5.10)</td><td>(4.92)</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of -1% Change in Rate of Discounting</td><td>6.80</td><td>5.78</td><td>5.59</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of +1% Change in Rate of Salary Increase</td><td>6.64</td><td>5.51</td><td>5.24</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of -1% Change in Rate of Salary Increase</td><td>(6.06)</td><td>(5.20)</td><td>(5.03)</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of +1% Change in Rate of Employee Turnover</td><td>0.28</td><td>0.42</td><td>0.57</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of -1% Change in Rate of Employee Turnover</td><td>(0.32)</td><td>(0.47)</td><td>(0.63)</td></tr></tbody></table>

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. While calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.

The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

### (iv) Defined benefit liability and employer contributions

The Company will pay demand raised by the trust towards gratuity liability on time to time basis to eliminate the deficit in defined benefit plan.

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 9 years (Previous Year: 9 years)

### (v) Risk exposure

Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment risk, interest rate risk and salary risk.

**Investment risk:** The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities and other debt instruments.

**Interest risk:** A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G. Sec. rate will increase the present value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of asset.

**Salary risk:** The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
