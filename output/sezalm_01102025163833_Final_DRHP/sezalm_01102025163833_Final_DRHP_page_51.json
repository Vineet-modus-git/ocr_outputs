Under the foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfer of shares between non-residents and residents are freely permitted (subject to compliance with sectoral norms and certain other restrictions) if they comply with the pricing guidelines and reporting requirements specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which are sought to be transferred, is not in compliance with such pricing guidelines or reporting requirements or does not fall under any of the exceptions specified by the RBI, then prior approval of the RBI will be required. Further, unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the Indian economy up to any extent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is required to follow certain prescribed procedures for making such investment. The RBI and the concerned ministries/departments are responsible for granting approval for foreign investment.

These include increasing importance of external trade and of external capital flows. Any slowdown in the growth of the Indian economy or any future volatility in global commodity prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. India's economy could be adversely affected by a general rise in interest rates, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, adverse conditions affecting housing, tourism and electricity prices or various other factors. Further, conditions outside India, such as slowdowns in the economic growth of other countries, could have an impact on the growth of the Indian economy and government policy may change in response to such conditions. The Indian economy and financial markets are also significantly influenced by worldwide economic, financial and market conditions. Any financial or political turmoil or war especially in the United States, Europe or China or Asian emerging market countries, may have an impact on the Indian economy. Although economic conditions differ in each country, investors' reactions to any significant developments in one country can have adverse effects on the financial and market conditions in other countries. A loss of investor confidence in the financial systems, particularly in other emerging markets, may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the price of the Equity Shares."}]
