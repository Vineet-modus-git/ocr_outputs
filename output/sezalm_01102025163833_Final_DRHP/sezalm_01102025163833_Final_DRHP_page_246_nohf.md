## Other Income

Other income decreased by 2.55%, falling to ₹55.68 lakhs in Fiscal 2025 from ₹57.14 lakhs in Fiscal 2024. The decline was primarily due to a marginal reduction in interest income on fixed deposits, which stood at ₹37.43 lakhs in Fiscal 2025 compared to ₹39.90 lakhs in the previous year. Other contributors, such as net foreign exchange gain (₹18.25 lakhs in Fiscal 2025 vs. ₹17.23 lakhs in Fiscal 2024), remained broadly stable, while miscellaneous income was nil in both years.

## Expenditure

### Purchase of Stock-in-Trade

Purchases of stock-in-trade amounted to ₹4,996.19 lakhs in Fiscal 2025 as against ₹6,236.74 lakhs in Fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, purchases declined from 83.43% in FY24 to 61.24% in FY25. The level of purchases remained broadly aligned with sales volumes; however, the ratio improved in FY24 and FY25 due to higher contribution margins from BS-VI vehicle kits and diesel conversions, which provided better pricing and procurement efficiency compared with earlier periods.

### A. Changes in Inventory of Finished Goods

Changes in inventory of finished goods stood at ₹467.42 lakhs in FY25 as against ₹556.00 lakhs in FY24. The lower adjustment in FY25 was primarily due to the sale of excess inventory carried forward from the previous year, which was sold during the current fiscal. This reflects a more efficient alignment of production with sales demand, resulting in reduced stock accumulation and healthier inventory turnover.

### B. Employee Benefit Expenses
