Judgments or decrees from jurisdictions, which do not have reciprocal recognition with India, cannot be executed in India. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in a non-reciprocating territory for civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the general laws of the non-reciprocating territory, would not be enforceable in India. Even if an investor obtained a judgment in such a jurisdiction against us or our officers or directors, it may be required to institute a new proceeding in India and obtain a decree from an Indian court. However, the party in whose favour such final judgment is rendered may bring a new suit in a competent court in India based on a final judgment that has been obtained in a non-reciprocating territory within three years of obtaining such final judgment in the same manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in India. If, and to the extent that, an Indian court were of the opinion that fairness and good faith so required, it would, under current practice, give binding effect to the final judgment that had been rendered in the non-reciprocating territory, unless such a judgment contravenes principles of public policy in India. It is unlikely that an Indian court would award damages on the same basis or to the same extent as was awarded in a final judgment rendered by a court in another jurisdiction if the Indian court believed that the amount of damages awarded was excessive or inconsistent with Indian practice. In addition, any person seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India is required to obtain prior approval of the RBI to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to the execution of such a judgment."}, {"bbox": [234, 824, 1497, 892], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**78.

Investors' reactions to developments in one country may have adverse effects on the market price of securities of companies located in other countries, including India. Negative economic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficits, or a default on national debt, in other emerging market countries may also affect investor confidence and cause increased volatility in Indian securities markets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. Any worldwide financial instability could also have a negative impact on the Indian economy, including the movement of exchange rates and interest rates in India and could then adversely affect our business, financial performance and the price of our Equity Shares. China is one of India's major trading partners and there are rising concerns of a strained relationship with India, which could have an adverse impact on the trade relations between the two countries. Developments in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, Iran and the Houthis rebels and certain western countries, have resulted in and may continue to result in a period of sustained instability across global financial markets, induce volatility in commodity prices, adversely impact availability of natural gas, increase in supply chain, logistics times and costs, increase borrowing costs, cause outflow of capital from emerging markets and may lead to overall slowdown in economic activity in India.
