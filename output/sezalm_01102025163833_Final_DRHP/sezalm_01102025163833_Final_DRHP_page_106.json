[{"bbox": [233, 272, 1499, 2110], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><tr><td>Inventory</td><td colspan=\"7\">The Company's inventories primarily comprise LPG and CNG kits, empty cylinders, and ancillary parts. Our business involves the supply of CNG conversion kits, which typically consist of around 18 parts, and Diesel conversion kits, which comprise approximately 34 parts and accessories. These components are sourced both locally and through imports from countries such as Italy and China.<br/><br/>Given the nature of our operations, imported parts are procured in bulk through container shipments to ensure economies of scale and uninterrupted availability of stock. Each consignment generally suffices the Company's requirement for 60-90 days, and subsequent orders are placed only after substantial utilization of existing stock. Since a kit cannot be completed in the absence of even a single part, it is operationally necessary to maintain adequate stock levels of all components. Furthermore, as the sole distributor for the Indian dealer, the Company is required to hold sufficient inventory to meet customer demand on a timely basis.<br/><br/>This operating model results in a relatively higher inventory holding period, which in turn increases the working capital requirement. However, the management has taken proactive steps to optimize the inventory cycle, resulting in a reduction in inventory days in recent years, and expects further improvement going forward. The trend in inventory days is summarized below:<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>31-Mar-23</th><th>31-Mar-24</th><th>31-Mar-25</th><th>31-Mar-26 (E)</th><th>31-Mar-27 (E)</th><th>31-Mar-28 (E)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Inventory Days</td><td>185</td><td>160</td><td>133</td><td>132</td><td>125</td><td>125</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"7\">The projected stabilization of inventory days at around 125 days reflects the Company's strategy of maintaining adequate stock to ensure uninterrupted operations, while simultaneously pursuing initiatives such as localization of certain imported components and enhanced supply-chain management to improve working capital efficiency and profitability.</td></tr><tr><td>Trade Receivable</td><td colspan=\"7\">Our trade receivables have reduced significantly from 301 days in FY 2023 to 206 days in FY 2024, primarily due to more efficient management of collections without affecting business relationships.<br/><br/>Going forward, receivable days are projected to remain in the range of 230-247 days. These projections reflect a conservative approach, considering the nature of our industry where certain large customers continue to avail extended credit terms. In addition, a higher proportion of future business is expected to be derived from government tenders, where the receivable cycle is inherently longer due to the time taken for approval and release of payments.</td></tr><tr><td>Trade Payable</td><td colspan=\"7\">Our trade payable days have remained broadly aligned with industry practice, though some fluctuations are visible due to operational reasons. Trade payable days increased marginally from 46 days in FY 2023 to 49 days in FY 2024, but reduced to 20 days in FY 2025. From FY 2026 onwards, payable days are projected to normalize in the range of 35-40 days, consistent with prevailing supplier arrangements in the industry.
