on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, we will be required to vacate such premise. Any failure to renew our lease or to find alternative area may have an impact on our operations and profitability.

25. **Pricing pressure from our customers may adversely affect our gross margin, profitability and ability to increase our prices, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.**

Our business operates in a highly competitive market, where customers—including institutional buyers, government entities, and corporate fleet operators, prioritize cost-effective solutions. Given the price-sensitive nature of our industry, we often face pricing pressure from customers who seek competitive pricing, bulk discounts, and cost-saving measures. This pressure may limit our ability to increase prices, directly impacting our gross margins and overall profitability.

To retain key customers and maintain market competitiveness, we may need to offer discounts, absorb cost escalations, or adjust pricing strategies. While such measures can help sustain customer relationships and market share, they could also reduce our profit margins and affect long-term financial sustainability. Additionally, in a market where price competition is intense, there is a risk that competitors may undercut pricing, forcing us to respond with further reductions, thereby exacerbating margin pressures.

Another critical challenge is the rising cost of raw materials, logistics, and currency fluctuations. Any inability to pass on increased costs to customers—whether due to contractual limitations, customer resistance, or intense market competition—could adversely impact our financial condition. Fluctuations in import duties, fuel prices, and supply chain costs further add to the pricing volatility, making it challenging to maintain stable profit margins.

While we continuously strive to optimize costs, enhance operational efficiency, and explore economies of scale, sustained pricing pressure could materially impact our revenue generation, financial performance, and long-term growth prospects. To mitigate these risks, we focus on strategic cost management, innovation in product offerings, and operational efficiencies to maintain competitiveness while safeguarding profitability. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will fully counteract pricing pressures in the market.

26. **Our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are not successful in forecasting customer demands, managing our inventory levels.**

Our business demands a significant level of Inventory because of high lead times. Effective inventory management is crucial for our operations. If we face inventory management issues, it could impede our ability to meet client demands promptly or, in some cases, at all. It may also cause supply chain disruptions which may also affect our gross margins and financial performance. The Inventories Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 are set out below:

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>March, 31, 2025</th><th>Fiscal 2024</th><th>Fiscal 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Inventories</td><td>2025.34</td><td>2492.76</td><td>1936.76</td></tr><tr><td>Average Inventory</td><td>2259.05</td><td>2214.76</td><td>1669.27</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory turnover ratio</td><td>3.59</td><td>3.42</td><td>2.82</td></tr></tbody></table>

27. **We have substantial capital expenditure and working capital requirements and may require additional financing to meet those requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.**

Our business demands a significant amount of working capital, with a substantial portion allocated to inventory management and trade receivables. Efficient working capital management is crucial for our operations. If we face challenges in sourcing the necessary working capital, it could impede our ability to meet client demands promptly or, in some cases, at all. Even if we secure the required funds, we cannot guarantee that they will be adequate to cover our cost estimates, and any unforeseen increase in expenses may impact the pricing of our products.
