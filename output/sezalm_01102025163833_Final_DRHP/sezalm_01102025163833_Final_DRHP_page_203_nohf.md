**g Revenue recognition**

**Revenue from Operation**

Revenue is generated primarily from sale of CNG & LPG Kits. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the goods is transferred to the customer upon dispatch or delivery, in accordance with the terms of customer contracts. Revenue is recognized at an amount that the Group expects to receive from customers that is net of trade discounts and goods and service tax (GST).

**h Income tax**

The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

Current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted by the end of reporting period for the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures its tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognized in Profit or Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

**i Leases**

**As a lessee**

Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability at the date which the lease asset is available for use by the Group. Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on relative stand-alone prices

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. This assessment involves the exercise of judgement about whether there is an identified asset, whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset and whether the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset.
