This is the first scientific project in India to address all aspects of value chain of hydrogen-based mobility. For this purpose, IOC R&D is procuring 15 indigenously manufactured/integrated hydrogen fuel cell buses to conduct 20,000 km field trial in Delhi NCR. 4 demo units of hydrogen production units amounting to 40 tonnes per day will also be set up. Of these, 3 plants are based on renewable sources (biomass gasification, reforming CBG and solar PV based electrolysis) producing green hydrogen."}, {"bbox": [233, 672, 1497, 739], "category": "Text", "text": "IOC R&D has joined hands with the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru to develop biomass gasification technology, which is the most economical pathway to the hydrogen economy."}, {"bbox": [233, 763, 1497, 861], "category": "Text", "text": "Furthermore, MoPNG has constituted an expert committee headed by Director, IOC (R&D) to study various techno-economical aspects of hydrogen production, storage and transportation. Results from these pilots will be utilized for scale up of these systems for use of Hydrogen as a clean energy source in the country."}]
