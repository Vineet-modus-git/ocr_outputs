A once-in-a-century pandemic, eruption of geopolitical conflicts, and extreme weather events have disrupted supply chains, caused energy and food crises, and prompted governments to take unprecedented actions to protect lives and livelihoods. The global economy has demonstrated resilience overall, but this masks uneven performance across regions and lingering fragilities. The negative supply shocks to the global economy since 2020 have had lasting effects on output and inflation, with varied impacts across individual countries and country groups. The sharpest contrasts are between advanced and developing economies. Whereas the former have caught up with activity and inflation projected before the pandemic, the latter are showing more permanent scars. They also remain more vulnerable to the types of commodity price surges that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine."}, {"bbox": [900, 761, 1493, 1298], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [234, 1311, 1498, 1499], "category": "Text", "text": "Now, as before, the global outlook will be shaped largely by fiscal and monetary choices, their international spillovers, the intensity of geoeconomic fragmentation forces, and the ability of governments to implement long-overdue structural reforms.

Newly elected governments (about half of the world population has gone or will go to the polls in 2024) could introduce significant shifts in trade and fiscal policy (Box 1.2). Moreover, the return of financial market volatility over the summer has stirred old fears about hidden vulnerabilities. This has heightened anxiety over the appropriate monetary policy stance— especially in countries where inflation is persistent and signs of slowdown are emerging. Further intensification of geopolitical rifts could weigh on trade, investment, and the free flow of ideas. This could affect long-term growth, threaten the resilience of supply chains, and create difficult trade-offs for central banks."}, {"bbox": [889, 1520, 1521, 1977], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [236, 1978, 521, 2011], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### GLOBAL OUTLOOK:"}, {"bbox": [234, 2039, 1498, 2138], "category": "Text", "text": "Before regional developments are discussed, it is important to review the key assumptions about commodity prices and fiscal and monetary policy on which the baseline projection is predicated.
