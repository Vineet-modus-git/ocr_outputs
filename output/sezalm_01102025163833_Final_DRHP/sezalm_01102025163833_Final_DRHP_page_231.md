## 39. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's business activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, namely liquidity risk, market risks and credit risk. In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company, derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency interest rate swap are entered to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures and interest rate exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.

The Company has adopted a Risk Management Policy wherein all material risks faced by the Company are identified and assessed. The Risk Management framework defines the risk management approach of the Company and includes collective identification of risks impacting the Company's business and documents their process of identification, mitigation and optimization of such risks.

Hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred into the cash flow hedge reserve through OCI and will be recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. This will effectively result in recognising interest expense at a fixed interest rate for the hedged loans and foreign currency borrowing at the fixed foreign currency rate.

### (a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading

The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.

Since the receivables on account of provision of services and loans are from related parties / promoter group companies, the risk of default is minimal. The credit risk on debt scheme of mutual funds / balances with banks is limited because the counterparties are banks or financial institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by credit-rating agencies.

### (b) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will fail in meeting its obligations to pay its financial liabilities. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due. In respect of its operations, the Company funds its activities primarily through cash generated in operations and working capital borrowings.

Management monitors the Company's liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. Cash which is not needed in the operating activities of the Company is invested in marketable liquid funds.

Based on recent trends observed, profitability, cash generation, cash surpluses held by the Company and the borrowing lines available, the Company does not envisage any material liquidity risks.
