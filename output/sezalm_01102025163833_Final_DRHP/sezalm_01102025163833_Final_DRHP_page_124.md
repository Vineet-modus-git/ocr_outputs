## INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

The global automobile industry is undergoing a transformative shift towards more sustainable and eco-friendly solutions. Among the key components of this transition are automobile ancillaries specializing in alternative fuel systems, specifically CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas). As the world increasingly prioritizes environmental sustainability and energy efficiency, the demand for CNG and LPG vehicles has surged, making this sector a pivotal area of growth within the automotive industry.

## AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IN INDIA:

The Indian automobile industry has historically been a good indicator of how well the economy is doing, as the automobile sector plays a key role in both macroeconomic expansion and technological advancement. The two-wheelers segment dominates the market in terms of volume, owing to a growing middle class and a huge percentage of India's population being young. Moreover, the growing interest of companies in exploring the rural markets further aided the growth of the sector. The rising logistics and passenger transportation industries are driving up demand for commercial vehicles. Future market growth is anticipated to be fueled by new trends including the electrification of vehicles, particularly three-wheelers and small passenger automobiles.

India enjoys a strong position in the global heavy vehicles market as it is the largest tractor producer, second-largest bus manufacturer, and third-largest heavy truck manufacturer in the world. India's annual production of automobiles in FY23 was 25.9 million vehicles. India has a strong market in terms of domestic demand and exports. In April 2024, the total production of passenger vehicles*, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, and quadricycles was 23,58,041 units. In FY23, total automobile exports from India stood at 47,61,487. This sector's share of the national GDP increased from 2.77% in 1992-1993 to around 7.1% presently. It employs about 19 million people directly and indirectly.

India is also a prominent auto exporter and has strong export growth expectations for the near future. In addition, several initiatives by the Government of India such as the Automotive Mission Plan 2026, scrappage policy, and production-linked incentive scheme in the Indian market are expected to make India one of the global leaders in the two-wheeler and four-wheeler market by 2022.

In the financial year 2024-25, passenger vehicle sales growth is expected to slow to approximately five percent. However, the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment is anticipated to outpace passenger car sales, driven by a continued preference for these vehicles among buyers. SUV sales are projected to increase by around 10 percent during the year, while sales of passenger cars and vans are likely to experience a slight decline.
