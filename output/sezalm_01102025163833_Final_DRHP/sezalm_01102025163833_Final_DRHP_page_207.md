## Notes to Ind AS Restated Consolidated Financial Statements

Expenditure incurred on assets which are not ready for their intended use comprising direct cost, related incidental expenses and attributable borrowing cost are disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.

### Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value:

Depreciation is calculated using Straight Line Method (SLM) to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives have been determined based on technical evaluation done by the management, which is in line with those specified by Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.

The assets useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss within other gains/ (losses).

The estimated useful lives of the property, plant and equipment are as under:

<table><thead><tr><td>Assets Group</td><td>Useful lives</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Plant and equipment</td><td>5 - 15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>3 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computers - server</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Freehold Building</td><td>60 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fixtures</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>8 years</td></tr></tbody></table>

### r Intangible assets:

Intangible assets being computer software, are stated at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of an intangible asset are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized as income or expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Cost of software is amortised over a period of 5 years being the estimated useful life.

### s Trade and other payables:

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless the payment is not due within 12 months of reporting period. Trade and other payables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

### t Borrowings:

Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in profit or loss over the period of borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

### u Borrowing costs:

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

### v Provisions and Contingencies:

#### (i) Provisions

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated.
