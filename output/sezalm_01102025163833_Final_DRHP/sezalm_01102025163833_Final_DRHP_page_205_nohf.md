**m Inventories**

Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. In the case of traded goods, cost is determined in accordance with the first in first out principle. Costs include the purchase price, non - refundable taxes and delivery and handling costs. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**n Non-Current assets held for sale**

Non- current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non -current asset is recognized at the date of de-recognition.

Non-Current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.

**o Investments and other financial assets**

**I. Classification**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

* those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through Other Comprehensive Income or through profit or loss) and

* those measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in equity instruments, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income.

**II. Measurement**

At initial recognition, the Group measures financial assets at its fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

**Debt instruments**

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

* **Amortised cost:** Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/ (losses). Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

* **Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI):** Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognized in profit and loss. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized in other gains/ (losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in Statement of Profit and Loss.

* **Fair value through profit or loss:** Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income.
