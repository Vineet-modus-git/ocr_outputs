### Financial Instrument not measured using Fair Value i.e. measured using amortized cost

The carrying value of Other financial assets / liabilities represent reasonable estimate of its fair value.

Note:

Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.

Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

There are no transfers between any levels during the year.

The Company does not have financial instrument at level 3 with unobservable input and hence no sensitivity analysis performed.
