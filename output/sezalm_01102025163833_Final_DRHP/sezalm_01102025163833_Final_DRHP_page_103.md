* The cost per vehicle, as per the invoice is adjusted with an estimated inflation rate of approximately 5% over a period of 1 year, based on the management's assessment.

Notes:

a) We have considered the above quotations for the budgetary estimate purpose. The actual cost of procurement and actual supplier/dealer may vary.

b) All quotations received from the vendors mentioned above are valid as on the date of this Draft Red Herring

Prospectus. However, we have not entered into any definitive agreements with any of these vendors and there can be no assurance that the same vendors would be engaged to eventually supply the machineries/equipment's or at the same costs.

c) The Vehicle models and quantity to be purchased are based on the present estimates of our management.

The Management shall have the flexibility to revise such estimates (including but not limited to change of machinery or vendor or addition/deletion of any machinery) at the time of actual placement of the order. In such case, the Management can utilize the surplus of proceeds, if any, arising at the time of actual placement of the order, to meet the cost of such other Vehicles or utilities, as required for approvals. Furthermore, if any surplus from the proceeds remains after meeting the total cost of Vehicles and utilities for the aforesaid purpose, the same will be used for our general corporate purposes, subject to limit of 15% of the amount raised by our Company through this Issue or Rs. 10 crores whichever is lower.

d) We are acquiring second hand Vehicles for which aging and remaining useful life is provided above

e) Quotations for development and certification cost and Type approval cost are not available as the organization which conducts the development, testing and approval is a Government organization which doesn't provide quotations so we have taken the cost incurred previously adjusted to inflation.
