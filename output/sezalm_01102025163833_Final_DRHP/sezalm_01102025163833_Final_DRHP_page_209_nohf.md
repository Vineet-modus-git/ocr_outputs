Exceptional items include income or expense that are of such significance and nature that separate disclosure enables the user of the financial statements to understand the impact in a more meaningful manner. Exceptional items are identified by virtue of their size, nature and incidence.

If the management believes that losses/ gain are material and is relevant to an understanding of the entity's financial performance, it discloses the same as an exceptional item.

All amounts disclosed in financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest lakhs as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.

**3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements:**

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates, which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies. This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items, which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different from those originally assessed.

* Estimation of useful life

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment are based on the management's estimation. The useful lives as estimated are same as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.

The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life such as changes in technology.
