product. If we fail to successfully introduce new products our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.

**38. Changes in technology may render our current technologies obsolete or require us to incur substantial capital expenditure.**

The alternative fuel industry is continuously evolving due to technological advancements and scientific discoveries. These innovations can lead to the introduction of new products, enhanced fuel efficiency solutions, and significant price competition. If our existing technologies become obsolete and we are unable to effectively introduce new, competitive products, our business operations, market position, and financial performance could be adversely affected.

While we strive to keep our technology, facilities, and machinery up to date with the latest industry standards, there is always a risk that the technologies we currently employ may become less competitive or outdated due to rapid advancements or shifts in market demand. Emerging alternative fuel solutions, such as next-generation biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, and battery-electric propulsion systems, may reshape industry dynamics, requiring us to make substantial capital investments to stay relevant. Failure to adapt to these changes could impact our ability to compete effectively and maintain sustainable revenue streams.

Additionally, the development of new products and technological upgrades in our business is heavily reliant on the research and development (R&D) efforts of Landi Renzo S.p.A., our primary technology partner. As these R&D initiatives are beyond our direct control, any delays, strategic shifts, or unforeseen challenges faced by Landi Renzo S.p.A. in developing innovative solutions could impact our ability to introduce new, advanced products into the market. Dependence on an external entity for technology development also exposes us to risks related to intellectual property rights, licensing agreements, and potential limitations on adopting proprietary innovations.

**Legal and Regulatory Risks**

**39. Our inability to obtain approvals for vehicles as per the norms prescribed by the Government may be detrimental to our business.**

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, inter alia, regulates the Vehicular Emission Norms in India and Government agencies. Government agencies carry out the inspection, testing, development and Approvals of the vehicles as per prerelevant norms for all types of vehicles. These vehicles are tested at the premises of Government organization. In case, the Vehicle does not comply with the quality norms prescribed by the Government, it would lead to further modification and testing which would in turn increase the cost incurred for development and approvals. Any failure in relation to quality control could lead to the cancellation of registration granted to our Company. While we have not experienced any such inabilities to obtain approvals for vehicles, we cannot assure you that we will not face such inabilities to obatined such approvals in the future, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

**40. In addition to normal remuneration, other benefits and reimbursement of expenses, some of our Directors (including our Promoter) are interested in our Company to the extent of their shareholding and dividend entitlement in our Company.**

Some of our Directors (including our Promoter) are interested in our Company to the extent of their shareholding and dividend entitlement in our Company, in addition to normal remuneration or benefits and reimbursement of expenses. For details, see “Summary of Issue Document - Summary of Related Party Transaction” on page 14. We cannot assure you that our Promoter and Directors would always exercise their rights as Shareholders to the benefit and best interest of our Company. As a result, our Promoter and Directors will continue to exercise significant control over our Company, including being able to control the composition of our Board of Directors and determine decisions requiring simple or special majority voting, and our other Shareholders may be unable to affect the outcome of such voting. Our Promoter and Directors may take or block actions with respect to our business, which may conflict with our best interests or the interests of other minority Shareholders, such as actions with respect to future capital raising or acquisitions. We cannot assure you that our Promoter and Directors will always act to resolve any conflicts of interest in our favour, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations and prospect.
