## Vehicle Type Approval Procedure

The approval process for each vehicle type is detailed and time-intensive, involving the following steps:

1. Procurement of vehicles compliant with the applicable Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms.

2. Overhaul and service to ensure the vehicle is in optimal working condition.

3. Engine modification, converting diesel engines to be CNG-compatible.

4. Installation of CNG kits in the vehicle.

5. Development testing, including laboratory tests to calibrate and fine-tune engine performance to meet emission and power output standards in CNG mode.

6. Submission of the modified vehicle to the authorized testing agency.

7. Regulatory testing under Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR), including emission, safety, and performance tests.

8. Certification, where, upon successful completion of all required tests, the testing agency issues a type approval certificate.

9. This certification is valid for a period of three years. Upon expiry, the company must repeat the above procedure to renew the approval. Therefore, vehicles are purchased not only to obtain initial certification but also to ensure continuity of type approval, and to secure access to specific vehicle models which may not be readily available through leasing arrangements.

## Proposed Capital Expenditure

The proposed capital expenditure comprises investments across four key areas:

### Vehicle Procurement

Vehicles are acquired specifically for the purpose of securing type approval certification from ICAT (International Centre for Automotive Technology), a government-authorized testing agency. This certification enables the company to legally install CNG or hybrid kits on the respective vehicle models.

### Modification Costs

These costs are incurred prior to development testing.

For heavy vehicles and four-wheelers, this involves converting petrol or diesel engines to CNG-compatible systems.

For two-wheelers undergoing hybrid conversion, components such as motors, controllers, batteries, wiring harnesses, throttles, and switches are integrated into the existing engine. This enables dual-mode operation—on both petrol and electric power. A prototype of the hybrid two-wheeler is submitted for type approval.
