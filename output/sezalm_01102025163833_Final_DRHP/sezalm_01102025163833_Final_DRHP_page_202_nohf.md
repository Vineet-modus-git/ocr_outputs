## Notes to Ind AS Restated Consolidated Financial Statements

### b Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis, except for the following:

* Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value (including derivative instruments);

* Defined benefit plans - plan assets are measured at fair value.

* Assets held for sale - measured at fair value less cost to sell.

### c Current vis-à-vis non-current classification

The assets and liabilities reported in the balance sheet are classified on a "current / non-current basis".

An asset is classified as current when it is expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle, held primarily for the purpose of trading, expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle, it is held primarily for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

The Group has determined its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current - non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities, and all assets and liabilities which are not current are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

The derivatives designated in hedging relationship and separated embedded derivatives are classified basis the hedged item and host contract respectively.

### d Business Combination

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations (other than common control business combinations), regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The cost of acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method and as per the provisions of the Scheme approved by the regulator. The difference between any consideration transferred and the aggregate historical carrying values of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised in Capital reserve.

### e Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM).

The Board of Directors of the group are responsible for allocating resources, assessing the financial performance and position of the group and make strategic decisions.

The Group has identified one reportable segment trading of CNG & LPG Kits based on information. Refer note 34 for segment information presented.

### f Foreign currency translation

#### (i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates ('the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in 'Indian Rupees' (INR), which is the Group's functional and presentation currency.

#### (ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are generally recognized in profit or loss. They are deferred in equity if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equity investments classified as FVOCI are recognized in other comprehensive income.
