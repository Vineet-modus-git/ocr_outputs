## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INFORMATION FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 COMPARED WITH FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023

Revenue from operations increased by 61.03%, from ₹4,702.39 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹7,572.38 lakhs in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher sales volumes of CNG and LPG kits. The Company sold 49,959 kits in Fiscal 2024 compared to 34,747 kits in Fiscal 2023.

In Fiscal 2023, revenue was lower as the Company's operations were impacted by the absence of clear guidelines for BS VI vehicle conversions and the requirement for mandatory certifications from testing agencies such as ICAT and ARAI. During this period, the Company's focus remained on obtaining the necessary approvals, which limited the number of conversions executed.

Following receipt of BS VI certifications between late Fiscal 2023 and early Fiscal 2024, the Company was able to expand its retrofitment activity to a larger vehicle base. This regulatory clearance enabled the execution of accumulated demand and new orders, resulting in a significant increase in kit sales and overall revenue in Fiscal 2024.

### Other Income

Other income decreased by 40.51%, falling to ₹57.14 lakhs in Fiscal 2024 from ₹96.05 lakhs in Fiscal 2023. The decline was mainly due to the absence of miscellaneous income (₹9.91 lakhs in FY23) and a lower contribution from foreign exchange gains (₹17.23 lakhs in FY24 vs. ₹47.70 lakhs in FY23).

Interest income on fixed deposits remained broadly stable at ₹39.90 lakhs in FY24 compared to ₹38.44 lakhs in FY23, partially offsetting the overall decline.

### Expenditure

#### Purchase of Stock-in-Trade

Our purchases of stock-in-trade increased by 43.07%, from ₹4,356.32 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹6,236.74 lakhs in Fiscal 2024. This growth was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of CNG and LPG kits, enabled by BS VI certification approvals. With the ability to service a wider vehicle base, the Company witnessed stronger demand, which necessitated larger procurement of kits and related components.

As a percentage of revenue, purchases declined from 92.64% in FY23 to 82.77% in FY24, reflecting improved operational efficiency, better absorption of fixed costs through higher capacity utilisation, and stronger contribution margins. The surge in orders also supported higher inventory turnover, ensuring smoother operations and more efficient resource allocation during the year.
