**Notes to Ind AS Restated Consolidated Financial Statements**

Assets and liabilities arising from lease are initially measured on present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- *Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable*

- *Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date*

- *Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees.*

- *The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and*

- *Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.*

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

- *where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received.*

- *uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by the Group, which does not have recent third party financing.*

- *makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.*

If a readily observable amortising loan rate is available to the individual lessee (through recent financing or market data) which has a similar payment profile to the lease, then the Group use that rate as a starting point to determine the incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Variable lease payments that depend on any key variable/condition are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payment occurs.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following

- *the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability*

- *any lease payments made at or before the commencement of date less any lease incentives received*

- *any initial direct costs, and*

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of IND AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**j Impairment of non-financial assets**

Assets are tested for impairment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

**k Cash and Cash Equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and on hand, and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of statement of cashflow cash and cash equivalent consist of cash and short-term deposit as defined above.

**l Trade Receivables**

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognized initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognized at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance.
