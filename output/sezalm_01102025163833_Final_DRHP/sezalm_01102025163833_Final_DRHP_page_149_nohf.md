We usually enter into long-term supply contracts with our suppliers and typically source products on a purchase order basis. The terms and conditions of these purchase orders contain provisions related to the supplier's product quantity, pricing, payment and delivery terms.

## OUR BUSINESS HISTORY

The company primarily engages in providing conversion kits, using critical components sourced from Lovato, Italy, which are then supplied to its dealers for sale to retail customers and in the case of tenders and corporate customers these kits are directly supplied and installed by Eco Fuel. Accessories like cylinders, cylinder valve, cylinder cover, timing advancer, and hardwares for these kits are sourced locally. The company's products are distributed through a network of distributors, who deliver them to Retrofitting Centres (RFCs) for installation, following training provided by Ecofuel to ensure standardized installation practices. The conversion kits are backed by warranties managed by Landi Renzo SpA and Eco Fuel jointly. In addition, Ecofuel provides ongoing maintenance and after-sales services through RFCs.
