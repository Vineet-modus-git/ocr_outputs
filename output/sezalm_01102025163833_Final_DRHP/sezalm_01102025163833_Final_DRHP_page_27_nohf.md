Our operations are subject to government policies in both India and Italy, which directly influence our ability to conduct business effectively. As Landi Renzo S.p.A. is an Italy-based company, any regulatory shifts, trade restrictions, or policy changes in Italy that impact the export of alternative fuel kits could disrupt our supply chain. Such disruptions may lead to procurement challenges, increased costs, shipment delays, or even supply shortages, ultimately affecting our ability to meet market demand. Changes in trade agreements, tariffs, or export regulations in Italy could further escalate costs and hinder smooth business operations.

Similarly, in India, our business is closely tied to government policies regarding alternative fuels, emissions standards, taxation, import duties, and vehicle retrofitting regulations. Any unfavourable regulatory changes, such as increased import duties on alternative fuel kits, modifications to emission norms, or new licensing requirements, could impact the affordability and adoption of our products. The withdrawal of government subsidies or incentives for alternative fuel vehicles, restrictions on CNG/LPG usage, or amendments to vehicle conversion policies could also significantly reduce market demand, negatively affecting our sales and revenue.

In addition, compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks requires continuous monitoring and adaptation. Any delays in obtaining necessary approvals for distribution, installation, or retrofitting of alternative fuel kits could affect our operational efficiency and financial performance. While we have not faced significant disruptions in past, while we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future. Failure to adhere to these regulatory requirements may lead to penalties, restrictions, or even suspension of our business activities.

Given our reliance on the regulatory landscape in both India and Italy, any sudden or adverse policy changes in either country could materially impact our business operations, financial stability, and long-term growth prospects. Maintaining flexibility and proactive engagement with regulatory authorities will be essential in navigating these challenges and ensuring business continuity.

4. **We are dependent on our exclusive dealership agreements with Landi Renzo SpA. If such agreements are terminated, we may consequently lose distributors and dealers that distribute our products, which could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.**

We are significantly dependent on our exclusive distribution agreement with Landi Renzo SpA, our primary supplier of alternate fuel kits. As their sole distributor, we manage all aspects of the Lovato-branded products in India, including promotion, distribution, marketing, sales, installation, and after-sales support. This concentrated reliance on a single supplier creates various vulnerabilities for our business. A potential termination of the agreement could expose us to multiple challenges across legal, contractual, and regulatory domains. Our use of the supplier's Lovato trademark, while necessary for business operations, carries inherent risks including brand dilution, reduced pricing flexibility, compressed profit margins, and potential market confusion. Furthermore, if the supplier decides to compete directly in our territory or revokes our exclusivity, the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives could be significantly compromised. Consequently, our business success and financial performance are inextricably linked to the supplier's performance and our ongoing relationship with them. Any deterioration in this relationship or adverse changes in the supplier's business could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and future prospects.

We are also exposed to legal and regulatory risks associated with the use of the brands of Lavato, such as trademark infringement claims or changes in intellectual property laws. Non-compliance with these regulations could result in legal disputes and financial penalties. Additionally, our dependency on the brands of Lavato extends to the supply chain, where any disruptions or quality issues could affect our ability to meet production targets and maintain product quality.

Our exclusive dealership agreement is terminable by Landi Renzo SpA by giving one-month advance notice to us without any cost and reason and also immediately upon misuse or breach of the terms and conditions of the agreements. If such agreements are terminated, we could lose sales to our customers and also could consequently lose distributors and dealers that distribute our products, any of which materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As a distributor of alternative fuel kits under the LOVATO brand, we are subject to strict quality requirements and regular inspections by Landi Renzo SpA, our brand licensor. Any failure to meet their prescribed quality standards may result in penalties, reputational damage, or even the termination of our agreement, which could severely impact our business operations and revenue.
