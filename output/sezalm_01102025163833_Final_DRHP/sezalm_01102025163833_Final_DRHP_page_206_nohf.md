**Notes to Ind AS Restated Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Equity instruments**

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. The Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in Other Comprehensive Income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss as other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

Changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in other gain/ (losses) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Where the asset is disposed off, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the 'FVOCI - Equity Instrument' is directly reclassified to retained earnings. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses), if any on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost less impairment loss, if any.

**III. Impairment of financial assets**

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables only, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109- 'Financial Instruments', which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables.

**IV. Derecognition of financial assets**

A financial asset is derecognized only when:

* The Group has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or

* retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients

Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognized. Where the entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognized.

Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognized if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Group retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognized to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.

**p Income recognition**

**Interest income**

Interest income from financial assets is recognized using the effective interest rate method.

Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance).

**Dividend**

Dividends are received from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and at FVOCI. Dividends are recognized as other income in profit or loss only when the right to receive payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.

**q Property, plant and equipment**

All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment, if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
