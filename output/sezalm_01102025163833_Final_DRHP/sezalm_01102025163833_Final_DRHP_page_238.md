### 48. FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS

These are the Group's first financial statements prepared in accordance with Ind AS. The accounting policies set out in note 2 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and in the preparation of an opening Ind AS balance sheet at March 31, 2022 (the Group's date of transition). In preparing its opening Ind AS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted the amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting standards notified under Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 (as amended) and other relevant provisions of the Act (previous GAAP or Indian GAAP). An explanation of how the transition from previous GAAP to Ind AS has affected the Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables and notes.

#### A. Exemptions and exceptions availed

Set out below are the applicable Ind AS 101 optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions applied in the transition from previous GAAP to Ind AS.

##### A.1.1 Ind AS optional exemptions

###### A.1.1.1 Deemed cost

Ind AS 101 permits a first-time adopter to elect to continue with the carrying value for all of its property, plant and equipment as recognised in the financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition.

Accordingly, the Group has elected to measure all of its property, plant and equipment at their previous GAAP carrying value.

###### A.1.1.2 Investments in associates

Under previous GAAP, investment in associates is carried at cost less impairment loss, if any in the Financial Statements. On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to use the previous GAAP carrying amount on its investment in associates on the date of transition as its deemed cost on that date, in its Financial Statements

#### A.1.2 Estimates

The entity's estimates in accordance with Ind AS at the date of transition shall be consistent with estimates made for the same date in accordance with previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any difference in accounting policies), unless there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error.

Ind AS estimates as at March 31, 2022 are consistent with the estimates as at the same date made in conformity with previous GAAP. The Group has made estimate relating to investment in equity instruments carried at FVOCI in accordance with Ind AS at the date of transition as these were not required under previous GAAP:
