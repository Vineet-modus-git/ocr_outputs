Further, please note that as disclosed in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus read with the General Information Document, Bid Cum Application Forms are liable to be rejected in the event that the Bid in the Bid cum Application Form "exceeds the Issue size and/or investment limit or maximum number of the Equity Shares that can be held under applicable laws or regulations or maximum amount permissible under applicable laws or regulations, or under the terms of the Red Herring Prospectus."

For example, an FPI must ensure that any Bid by a single FPI and/ or an investor group (which means the same multiple entities having common ownership directly or indirectly of more than 50% or common control) (collective, the "FPI Group") shall be below 10% of the total paid-up Equity Share capital of our Company on a fully diluted basis. Any Bids by FPIs and/ or the FPI Group (including but not limited to (a) FPIs Bidding through the MIM Structure; or (b) FPIs with separate registrations for offshore derivative instruments and proprietary derivative instruments) for 10% or more of our total paid-up post Issue Equity Share capital shall be liable to be rejected.

Post the repeal of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996, venture capital funds which have not re-registered as AIFs under the SEBI AIF Regulations shall continue to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 until the existing fund or scheme managed by the fund is wound up and such fund shall not launch any new scheme after the notification of the SEBI AIF Regulations. The SEBI FVCI Regulations prescribe the investment restrictions on FVCIs.

Category I and II AIFs cannot invest more than 25% of their investible funds in one investee company. A category III AIF cannot invest more than 10% of its investible funds in one investee company. A VCF registered as a category I AIF, cannot invest more than one-third of its investible funds, in the aggregate, in certain specified instruments, including by way of subscription to an initial public offering of a venture capital undertaking whose shares are proposed to be listed. Additionally, the VCFs which have not re-registered as an AIF under the SEBI AIF Regulations shall continue to be regulated by the SEBI VCF Regulations until the existing fund or scheme managed by the fund is wound up and such funds shall not launch any new scheme after the notification of the SEBI AIF Regulations.

Participation of AIFs, VCFs and FVCIs shall be subject to the FEMA Rules.

Further, the shareholding of VCFs, category I AIFs or category II AIFs and FVCIs holding equity shares of a company prior to an initial public offering being undertaken by such company, shall be exempt from lock-in requirements, provided that such equity shares shall be locked in for a period of at least six months period from the date of purchase by the venture capital fund or alternative investment fund or foreign venture capital investor.
