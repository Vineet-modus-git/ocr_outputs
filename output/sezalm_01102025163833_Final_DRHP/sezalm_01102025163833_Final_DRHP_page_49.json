Investors may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of capital gains on sale of Equity Shares."}, {"bbox": [336, 1313, 1496, 2136], "category": "Text", "text": "Under current Indian tax laws and regulations, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares in an Indian company are generally taxable in India. A securities transaction tax (\"STT\") is levied on and collected by an Indian stock exchange on which equity shares are sold. Any capital gain exceeding ₹100,000, realized on the sale of equity shares held for more than 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer, which are sold using any other platform other than on a recognized stock exchange and on which no STT has been paid, are subject to long-term capital gains tax in India. The Finance Act, 2019 amended the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 with effect from July 1, 2020, and clarified that, in the absence of a specific provision under an agreement, the liability to pay stamp duty in case of sale of securities through stock exchanges will be on the buyer, while in other cases of transfer for consideration through a depository, the onus will be on the transferor. The stamp duty for transfer of securities other than debentures on a delivery basis is specified at 0.015% and on a non-delivery basis is specified at 0.003% of the consideration amount. The Finance Act, 2020, has, among others things, provided a number of amendments to the direct and indirect tax regime, including, without limitation, a simplified alternate direct tax regime and that dividend distribution tax will not be payable in respect of dividends declared, distributed or paid by a domestic company after March 31, 2020, and accordingly, that such dividends not be exempt in the hands of the shareholders, both resident as well as non-resident, and that such dividends likely be subject to tax deduction at source. The Company may or may not grant the benefit of a tax treaty (where applicable) to a non-resident shareholder for the purposes of deducting tax at source from such dividend. Investors should consult their own tax advisors about the consequences of investing or trading in the Equity Shares. Further, any gain realized on the sale of listed equity shares held for a period of 12 months or less will be subject to short term capital gains tax in India. In cases where the seller is a non-resident, capital gains arising from the sale of the equity shares will be partially or wholly exempt from taxation in India in cases where the exemption from taxation in India is provided under a treaty between India and the country of which the seller is resident. Historically, Indian tax treaties do not limit India's ability to impose tax on capital gains. As a result, residents of other countries may be liable for tax in India as well as in their own jurisdiction on a gain upon the sale of the equity shares. Further, we cannot predict whether any tax laws or other regulations impacting it will be enacted or predict the nature and impact of any such laws or regulations or whether, if at all, any laws or regulations would have a material adverse"}]
