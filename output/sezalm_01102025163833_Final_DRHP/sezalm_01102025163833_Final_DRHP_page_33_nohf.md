on Research and Development and technology and are thus able to come out with very effective and highly improved versions of the kits. Hence, these lower prices force us to face substantial competition.

Further, the approvals to be obtained has resulted in the entry barrier in alternate fuel category. The period for development and obtaining approval for each type of vehicle can run into several months. If a competitor obtains the approval faster than our company, it could take a long period for us to find and supply a suitably to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of our competitors may have, or are subsidiaries of large international corporations that have, significantly greater resources than those available to us. If we are unable to compete effectively, including in terms of pricing or providing quality products, our market share may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

20. **Our warehouse facilities are concentrated in Mumbai and Gujarat in India. Any significant social, political, economic or seasonal disruption, natural calamities or civil disruptions in such a states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.**

Our warehouse facilities are primarily located in Mumbai and Gujarat, making our business heavily reliant on these regions for storage and distribution. This geographic concentration presents certain operational risks, as any significant social, political, economic, or seasonal disruptions in these states could adversely impact our supply chain, delay deliveries, and affect overall business performance.

Apart from environmental risks, civil disruptions such as labor strikes, protests, regulatory changes, or local policy amendments could affect warehouse operations and the movement of goods. Prolonged periods of labor unrest or supply chain bottlenecks may lead to increased operational costs, delays in fulfilling customer orders, and potential revenue loss. Furthermore, any unexpected government regulations or taxation changes affecting logistics and warehousing in these regions could impact our cost structure and overall business efficiency.

The concentration of warehousing in limited geographic regions increases our vulnerability to localized disruptions. Unlike businesses with a diversified network of warehouses across multiple states, we face a higher degree of exposure to risks associated with Mumbai and Gujarat. Any prolonged disruption in these regions, whether due to infrastructure failures, political instability, or force majeure events, could significantly affect our revenue, profitability, and financial condition.

If our existing storage and distribution infrastructure faces prolonged disruptions, it could have a material adverse impact on our supply chain resilience, operational efficiency, and long-term growth prospects.

21. **Our success largely depends upon the knowledge and experience of our Promoters, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management Personnel as well as our ability to attract and retain personnel with technical expertise. Our inability to retain our Promoters, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management Personnel or our ability to attract and retain other personnel with technical expertise could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.**

We depend on the management skills and guidance of our Promoters and Board of Directors for development of business strategies, monitoring their successful implementation and meeting future challenges. Further, we also significantly depend on the expertise, experience and continued efforts of our Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management Personnel. Any loss of our Promoters, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management Personnel or our ability to attract and retain them and other skilled personnel could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future performance will depend largely on our ability to retain the continued service of our management team. If one or more of our Key Managerial Personnel or Senior Management Personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present position, it could be difficult for us to find a suitable or timely replacement and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Additionally, we may require a long period of time to hire and train replacement personnel when personnel with technical expertise terminate their employment with us. We may also be required to increase our levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining personnel with technical expertise that our business requires. The loss of the services of such persons could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

While these positions have been appropriately filled and we have not faced any impact due to the resignations, we cannot assure that future resignations will not have any impact on the Company's business or operations.
