**Notes to Ind AS Restated Consolidated Financial Statements**

* Estimation of defined benefit obligation

The present value of obligations under defined benefit plan is determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual development in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary escalations, attrition rate and mortality rates etc. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these obligations are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Refer note 40 for the details of the assumptions used in estimating the defined benefit obligation.

* Impairment of trade receivables

The impairment provisions for trade receivables are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Group's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.

* Fair value measurements and valuation processes

Some of the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. The Management determines the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs for the fair value measurements.

In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, fair values are determined on the basis of the third-party valuations. The models used to determine fair values including estimates/ judgements involved are validated and periodically reviewed by the management. Refer note 41 to the financial statements.

* Inventory obsolescence

The Group writes down inventories to net realisable value based on an estimate of the realisability of inventories. Write downs on inventories are recorded where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the balances may not realised. The identification of write-downs requires the use of estimates of net selling prices of the down-graded inventories. Where the expectation is different from the original estimate, such difference will impact the carrying value of inventories and write-downs of inventories in the periods in which such estimate has been changed.

* Taxes

Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
