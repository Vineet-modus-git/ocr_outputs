This trend underscores the need for policy reforms, investments in advanced extraction technologies, and a strategic shift toward sustainable and diversified energy sources to stabilize and potentially revitalize the natural gas industry.

## Alternative Fuel and Clean Energy Sector

The global energy landscape is experiencing a significant transformation due to factors like climate change, dwindling fossil fuel reserves, and rising energy costs. This shift has fueled a growing demand for clean and sustainable energy solutions. As a result, the alternative fuel and clean energy sector has become a dynamic and rapidly expanding industry, creating numerous opportunities for companies such as Eco Fuel Systems Inc.

**Growing Environmental Concerns:** The increasing impact of climate change has prompted both governments and consumers to focus on environmentally friendly solutions. Strict emission regulations and the implementation of carbon taxes are encouraging the shift toward cleaner fuels.

**Depleting Fossil Fuel Reserves:** The limited availability of fossil fuels, along with geopolitical tensions related to their supply, has intensified the search for alternative energy sources.

**Economic Viability:** The falling costs of renewable energy technologies, combined with rising fossil fuel prices, have made alternative fuels and clean energy solutions more economically appealing.

**Technological Advancements:** Innovations in battery technology, fuel cell development, and renewable energy generation have significantly advanced the industry.

**Government Support:** Numerous countries are providing incentives, subsidies, and supportive policies to foster the adoption of clean energy technologies.

## Hydrogen Mission by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas

Hydrogen is a clean source of energy for the future. It can be an important pillar of energy security of the country. While India has to continue in R&D efforts to bring down the cost of production as well as storage and transportation, it has to be ready for pilot scale production and use for various applications.

The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG) is undertaking few initiatives with respect to the greater use of hydrogen in the energy mix. The first pilot is based on Grey Hydrogen [1], or Hydrogen CNG (H-CNG) initiative, where hydrogen is blended with compressed natural gas (CNG) to the extent of 18%, for use as transportation fuel at Rajghat Bus depot. Under this pilot, 50 buses in Delhi are plying on blended Hydrogen in Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).

Secretary P&NG convened a meeting of the petroleum sector oil and gas marketing companies with prominent solar power producers to explore the possibility of utilization of solar power to generate hydrogen. As an outcome of these deliberations, five other pilots are planned based on Green Hydrogen where hydrogen produced is to be used as transportation fuel as well as an industrial input to refineries.

Following Pilots based on Green Hydrogen are being planned:

1. Two Pilot for Setting up of Solar hydrogen refueling station at two locations (locations to be identified upon consultation with the Green Hydrogen suppliers) for demonstration of fuel cell vehicles at tourist sites like Delhi-Agra, Gujarat (Statue of Unity), etc.

2. One Pilot for setting up a green hydrogen plant to explore an opportunity of replacing conventional hydrogen in refinery with green hydrogen.

3. One Pilot for production of green hydrogen and its blending with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) at an appropriate site in Rajasthan for dispensing at retail outlets.

4. One Pilot for setting up of green hydrogen infrastructure and pipeline injection of green hydrogen in City Gas Distribution (CGD) network.

These pilots are at preliminary stage of preparation and different modalities are being worked to achieve the purpose of pilots mentioned above.
