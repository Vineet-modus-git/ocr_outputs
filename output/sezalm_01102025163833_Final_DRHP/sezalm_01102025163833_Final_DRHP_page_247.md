C. Employee benefit expenses increased by 28.17%, to ₹352.52 lakhs in FY25 from ₹275.04 lakhs in FY24. The rise was mainly due to salary revisions, performance incentives, and addition of manpower to manage steady CNG conversion volumes and AMC activities.

D. **Finance Costs**

E. Finance costs decreased by 47.71%, to ₹81.31 lakhs in FY25 from ₹155.51 lakhs in FY24. The reduction was primarily due to lower utilisation of working capital limits and improved borrowing terms.

F. **Depreciation & Amortisation**

G. Depreciation and amortisation expenses increased marginally by 2.84%, to ₹58.21 lakhs in FY25 from ₹56.60 lakhs in FY24, reflecting the impact of assets capitalised in the previous year and normal depreciation on the existing asset base.

H. **Other Expenses**

Other expenses increased by 106.53% to ₹497.79 lakhs in Fiscal 2024 from ₹241.03 lakhs in Fiscal 2023, primarily due to a significant rise in homologation and certification costs for BS VI CNG conversion kits. Homologation expenses rose to ₹155.87 lakhs in Fiscal 2024 from ₹32.01 lakhs in Fiscal 2023, representing 31.31% of total other expenses in Fiscal 2024 as compared to 13.28% in the previous year.

The increase was attributable to higher testing and approval requirements from agencies such as ICAT and ARAI to obtain certifications for BS VI-compliant retrofitment kits. These expenses were necessary to expand the product portfolio and meet regulatory compliance for conversions, enabling the Company to cater to a larger vehicle base in line with market demand.
