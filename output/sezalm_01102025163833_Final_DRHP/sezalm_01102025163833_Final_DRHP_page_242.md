**Key Performance Indicators**

In evaluating our business, we consider and use certain key performance indicators that are presented below as Supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of these key performance indicators are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Restated Financial Information included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. We present these key performance indicators because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Further, these key performance indicators may differ from the similar information used by other companies and due to non availability of peer's company comparability may be limited. Therefore, these matrices should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to as measures of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or results of operation. A list of our KPIs for the period ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 is set out below:
