## PRODUCTS PROCUREMENT PROCESS- Materials, Suppliers and Utilities

*Procurement of raw material and Logistics*

The procurement process begins with Eco fuel placing orders with suppliers such as Landi Renzo SpA for kits, and other required components like empty cylinders are procured from Indian suppliers. Payments are handled either through advance payments or Letters of Credit (L/Cs) based on agreed terms. Once the components are procured, they are imported using appropriate transportation modes and stored in warehouses equipped with tracking systems to maintain inventory accuracy and ensure smooth operations.

Assembled kits are distributed to authorized distributors and dealers, who, in turn, supply the kits to Retro fitment Centres (RFCs) for vehicle installations. Eco fuel also provides training to distributors and RFCs, ensuring the proper installation of conversion kits to maintain quality and customer satisfaction.

Warranty services are jointly managed by Landi Renzo SpA and Eco Fuel. Maintenance services are conducted via RFCs to provide ongoing support for customers.

Our company sources empty cylinders from a network of trusted suppliers. Upon procurement, these cylinders are systematically stored in our secure warehouses, where they undergo thorough quality checks to ensure compliance with safety and regulatory standards. Once cleared, the cylinders are dispatched to our authorized dealers, who oversee their installation in vehicles and facilitate the necessary gas refilling process. This structured supply chain ensures the seamless distribution of high-quality cylinders while maintaining operational efficiency and safety at every stage.

Our company, in collaboration with Landi Renzo SpA, organizes training camps for its dealers across India as part of the agreement for supplying alternate fuel kits. The Landi Renzo SpA Engineers from Italy conduct training sessions only when a new product is introduced to the market. Otherwise, the training camps are regularly led by Eco Fuel Systems Engineers, who provide hands-on demonstrations to equip dealers with the necessary technical expertise to install and maintain the kits. These sessions ensure that dealers stay updated on the latest techniques, upholding the quality, reliability, and safety of installations across all markets.

Supply chain management plays a crucial role in our business operations. We maintain strong relationships with our supply chain partners, particularly Landi Renzo SpA. During the period September 2024, Fiscal Years 2024, 2023, and 2022, 40.04%, 68.01%, 46.43% and 43.47% of our total purchases, respectively, were sourced from Landi Renzo SpA. Our ability to maintain reliable supply chain relationships ensures the consistent availability of products to our customers.
