**Principles of consolidation :**

(i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the group

(ii) Associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting (see (ii) below), after initially being recognised at cost.

(iii) Equity method:

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of post acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the group's share of other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the group's interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred

The carrying amount of equity accounted investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy mentioned in note 2O below.

After application of the equity method of accounting, the Group determines whether there are any objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the net investment in an associate and that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows from the net investment that can be reliably estimated. If there exists such an objective evidence of impairment, then an impairment loss is recognised with respect to the Group's investment in the associate.

The Group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the investment ceases to be an associate, or when the investment is classified as held for sale.
