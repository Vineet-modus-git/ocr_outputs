aggregate holding of FPIs in a company, holding of all registered FPIs shall be included.

In case of Bids made by FPIs, a certified copy of the certificate of registration issued under the SEBI FPI Regulations is required to be attached to the Bid cum Application Form, failing which our Company, in consultation with the BRLM reserves the right to reject any Bid without assigning any reason, subject to applicable laws.

Subject to compliance with all applicable Indian laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and approvals in terms of regulation 21 of the SEBI FPI Regulations, an FPI, may issue, subscribe to or otherwise deal in offshore derivative instruments (as defined under the SEBI FPI Regulations as any instrument, by whatever name called, which is issued overseas by a FPI against securities held by it in India, as its underlying) directly or indirectly, only in the event (i) such offshore derivative instruments are issued only by persons registered as Category I FPIs; (ii) such offshore derivative instruments are issued only to persons eligible for registration as Category I FPIs; (iii) such offshore derivative instruments are issued after compliance with 'know your client' norms; and (iv) such other conditions as may be specified by SEBI from time to time.

An FPI issuing offshore derivative instruments is also required to ensure that any transfer of offshore derivative instruments issued by, or on behalf of it subject to, inter alia, the following conditions:

(i) such offshore derivative instruments are transferred to persons subject to fulfilment of SEBI FPI Regulations; and

(ii) prior consent of the FPI is obtained for such transfer, except when the persons to whom the offshore derivative instruments are to be transferred are pre-approved by the FPI.

The FPIs who wish to participate in the Issue are advised to use the Bid cum Application Form for non-residents. Bids received from FPIs bearing the same PAN shall be treated as multiple Bids and are liable to be rejected, except for Bids from FPIs that utilize the multiple investment manager structure in accordance with the operational guidelines for FPIs and designated Depository Participants issued to facilitate implementation of SEBI FPI Regulations (such structure referred to as "MIM Structure"), provided such Bids have been made with different beneficiary account numbers, Client IDs and DP IDs.

Accordingly, it should be noted that multiple Bids received from FPIs, who do not utilize the MIM Structure, and bear the same PAN, are liable to be rejected. In order to ensure valid Bids, FPIs making multiple Bids using the same PAN, and with different beneficiary account numbers, Client IDs and DP IDs, are required to provide a confirmation in the Bid cum Application Forms that the relevant FPIs making multiple Bids utilize the MIM Structure. In the absence of such confirmation from the relevant FPIs, such multiple Bids shall be rejected.

Further, in the following cases, Bids by FPIs shall not be treated as multiple Bids:

(i) FPIs which utilise the MIM structure, indicating the name of their respective investment managers in such confirmation;

(ii) Offshore derivative instruments which have obtained separate FPI registration for ODI and proprietary derivative investments;

(iii) Sub funds or separate class of investors with segregated portfolio who obtain separate FPI registration;

(iv) FPI registrations granted at investment strategy level/sub fund level where a collective investment scheme or fund has multiple investment strategies/sub-funds with identifiable differences and managed by a single investment manager;

(v) Multiple branches in different jurisdictions of foreign bank registered as FPIs;

(vi) Government and Government related investors registered as Category 1 FPIs; and

(vii) Entities registered as collective investment scheme having multiple share classes.

The Bids belonging to any of the above mentioned seven structures and having same PAN may be collated and identified as a single Bid in the Bidding process. The Equity Shares allotted in the Bid may be proportionately distributed to the Applicant FPIs (with same PAN). In order to ensure valid Bids, FPIs making multiple Bids using the same PAN, and with different beneficiary account numbers, Client IDs and DP IDs, are required to provide a confirmation along with each of their Bid cum Application Forms that the relevant FPIs making multiple Bids utilize any of the above-mentioned structures and indicate the name of their respective investment managers in such confirmation. In the absence of such confirmation from the relevant FPIs, such multiple Bids shall be rejected.

Please note that in terms of the General Information Document, the maximum Bid by any Bidder including QIB Bidder should not exceed the investment limits prescribed for them under applicable laws. Further, MIM Bids by an FPI Bidder utilising the MIM Structure shall be aggregated for determining the permissible maximum Bid.
