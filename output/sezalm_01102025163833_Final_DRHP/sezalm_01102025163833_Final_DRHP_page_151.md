## QUALITY POLICY AND CONTROL MEASURES

As the exclusive distributor of Lovato kits in India, we ensure that all products meet quality standards set by Landi Renzo SpA. Lovato's manufacturing facilities hold various local and international certifications, ensuring reliability and compliance with industry norms.

While we do not have in-house quality certifications, we conduct inspections and quality checks at multiple stages before distributing the kits to our dealers and retrofitment centers. Our goal is to provide customers with certified, quality products at competitive prices, backed by Lovato's globally recognized expertise.

## SALES & MARKETING

Our marketing strategy focuses on building customer loyalty and expanding our client base. To attract new clients, we are targeting top industry players such as OEMs through direct engagement and tendering process for retrofitment and highlighting our expertise in conversion kit distribution. This approach helps us with customer retention and also assisting in new client acquisition. The marketing practices adopted by the Company includes Advertising through social media, pamphlets and brochures. We have appointed a P.R agency to work on social media marketing.

## COMPETITION

We operate within a specialized and regulated industry. The market is made up of numerous independent service providers. In this competitive landscape, a significant share is held by local, unorganized players who are cost-efficient but lack experienced staff, leading to issues with quality and warranty, and resulting in low customer satisfaction. As an established, we hold a competitive advantage by offering products of a globally recognized brand, this helps us build trust among our customers.

We believe that our employees are the key to the success of our business and hence we have a structured organization plan to take care of the growth and motivation aspects of our team. Our manpower is a prudent mix of experienced and young personnel which gives us the dual advantage of stability and growth.
