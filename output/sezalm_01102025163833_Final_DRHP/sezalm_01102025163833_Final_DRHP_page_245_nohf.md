## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INFORMATION FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2025 COMPARED WITH FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2024

### Revenue from Operations

Revenue from operations increased by 7.00%, from ₹7,572.37 lakhs in Fiscal 2024 to ₹8,102.61 lakhs in Fiscal 2025. The growth was primarily attributable to the steady execution of CNG conversion orders, supported by a consistent demand trend across the Company's customer base.

Unlike the significant increase in the previous year, which was driven by the commencement of BS VI conversions post-certification, revenue in Fiscal 2025 reflected a stable volume of retrofitment activities without any major regulatory or market-driven surge. The business maintained its scale of operations, ensuring a consistent flow of installations and service income during the year.
