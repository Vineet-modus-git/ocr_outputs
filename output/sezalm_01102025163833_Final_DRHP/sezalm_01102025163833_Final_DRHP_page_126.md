As traders awaited the next OPEC+ meeting, WTI crude oil futures rose above $68 per barrel on Monday, bolstered by positive economic statistics from China. Following a series of stimulus measures implemented in late September, China's manufacturing activity increased in November for the second consecutive month and at the strongest rate in five months, indicating a fragile rebound in the world's top oil importer. The postponed OPEC+ meeting, which was rescheduled for later this week, is still a major topic of discussion. It is anticipated that the organization would delay a planned output rise for the third time. Furthermore, the Middle East's geopolitical unrest keeps driving up oil prices with a risk premium.

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for petroleum (crude) highlights a notable and persistent decline in the production levels of crude petroleum over the years, signaling a challenging phase for the sector. In 2017-18, the index stood at 93.7, serving as a relatively strong benchmark. However, the following years saw a steady decline, with the index falling to 89.8 in 2018-19 and further dropping to 84.5 in 2019-20, indicating a weakening trend in production. This downward trajectory continued in 2020-21, with the index decreasing to 80.1, followed by further declines to 77.9 in 2021-22 and 77.1 in 2023-24. The consistent drop over seven years suggests that the sector has faced significant challenges, which may include resource constraints such as depletion of crude reserves, increased exploration and production costs, or declining efficiency in extraction technologies. Additionally, external factors such as regulatory

changes, environmental concerns, and global energy transitions towards renewable sources might have compounded the difficulties. This prolonged period of underperformance highlights the need for strategic interventions to revitalize the sector, such as exploring advanced extraction technologies, diversifying energy portfolios, and investing in sustainable alternatives to address the structural challenges faced by the crude petroleum industry.

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for natural gas reveals a consistent decline in production over the seven-year period from 2017-18 to 2023-24, highlighting challenges faced by the sector. The index began at 93.7 in 2017-18, declining steadily to 89.8 in 2018-19 and further to 84.5 in 2019-20. The downward trend continued through 2020-21, where the index dropped to 80.1, followed by 77.9 in 2021-22 and 77.1 in 2023-24.

This sustained decrease indicates several underlying issues affecting natural gas production. These may include declining efficiency in extraction processes, depletion of easily accessible reserves, and increased operational and exploration costs. Moreover, external pressures such as changing global energy policies, growing emphasis on

renewable energy, and environmental concerns around fossil fuel usage may have further impacted production levels.
