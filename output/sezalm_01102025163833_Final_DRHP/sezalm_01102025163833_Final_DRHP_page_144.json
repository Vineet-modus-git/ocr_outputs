This ensures safe handling, optimal engine performance, and compliance with regulations. The reducer works by gradually reducing pressure through valves and chambers, delivering the reduced-pressure CNG to the engine. Regular maintenance is essential for its proper functioning and longevity.</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>ECU Wiring Harness - Smart-II</td><td>The Smart-II ECU and wiring harness are essential components in modern vehicles. The ECU serves as the \"brain\" of the CNG System, managing various aspects of its operation. The wiring harness connects the ECU to sensors and actuators, allowing for data transmission and control. Together, they ensure efficient performance, safety, emissions control, and diagnostics.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>ECU - C-OBDII-4 Cyl</td><td>The C-OBDII-4 Cyl ECU and wiring harness are essential components in four-cylinder vehicles. The ECU ensures emissions compliance, optimizes performance, and facilitates diagnostics. The wiring harness connects the ECU to various sensors and actuators, enabling data transmission and control. Together, they play a crucial role in modern vehicles, ensuring efficient operation and compliance with environmental regulations.</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [362, 500, 850, 915], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [362, 995, 871, 1424], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [362, 1559, 857, 2014], "category": "Picture"}]
