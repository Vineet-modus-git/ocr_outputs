A downgrading of India's credit ratings may occur, for example, upon a change of government tax or fiscal policy, which is outside our control.

Under the Competition Act, any formal or informal arrangement, understanding, or action in concert, which causes or is likely to cause an AAEC, is considered void and may result in the imposition of substantial penalties. Further, any agreement among competitors which directly or indirectly involves the determination of purchase or sale prices, limits or controls production, supply, markets, technical development, investment, or the provision of services, or shares the market or source of production or provision of services in any manner, including by way of allocation of geographical area or number of customers in the relevant market or directly or indirectly results in bid-rigging or collusive bidding is presumed to have an AAEC and is considered void. The Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by any enterprise. On April 11, 2023, the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2023 received the assent of the President of India to become the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 (“Competition Amendment Act”), amending the Competition Act and giving the CCI additional powers to prevent practices that harm competition and the interests of consumers. It has been enacted to increase the ease of doing business in India and enhance transparency. The Competition Amendment Act, inter alia, modifies the scope of certain factors used to determine AAEC, reduces the overall time limit for the assessment of combinations by the CCI and empowers the CCI to impose penalties based on the global turnover of entities, for anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant position. The Competition Act aims to, among others, prohibit all agreements and transactions which may have an AAEC in India. Consequently, all agreements entered by us could be within the purview of the Competition Act. Further, the CCI has extraterritorial powers and can investigate any agreements, abusive conduct, or combination occurring outside India if such agreement, conduct, or combination has an AAEC in India. However, the impact of the provisions of the Competition Act on the agreements entered by us cannot be predicted with certainty at this stage. We may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or interpretation of any provision of the Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the CCI, or any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the CCI or if any prohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects."}, {"bbox": [234, 1827, 1185, 1862], "category": "List-item", "text": "77. **Investors may not be able to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against us.**"}, {"bbox": [335, 1888, 1497, 2137], "category": "Text", "text": "Our Company is a company incorporated under the laws of India.
