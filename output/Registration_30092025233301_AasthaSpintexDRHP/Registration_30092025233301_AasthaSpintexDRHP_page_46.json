We rely on third-party transportation and logistics service providers for procurement of raw materials and supply of our products, and any disruption or inefficiency in such services may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.**\n\nWe do not maintain an in-house transportation fleet and depend entirely on third-party service providers for the movement of raw materials to our ginning and spinning facility at Halvad, Morbi, Gujarat, as well as for the delivery of our products to our customers. These services are typically engaged on a transactional, needs-based basis, and we do not generally enter into long-term contractual arrangements with such logistics providers.\n\nThis reliance exposes us to risks such as limited availability of vehicles during peak cotton procurement season, rising fuel and freight costs, delays in transit, accidents, strikes, natural calamities, regulatory restrictions, and congestion at ports or warehouses. Moreover, the value of cotton bales and yarn transported is significantly higher than the freight charges paid, making it difficult to recover adequate compensation in the event of loss, damage, or delay of goods in transit.\n\nAny disruption in transportation services or delays in delivery of raw materials or products could impact our production schedules, lead to order cancellations, contractual penalties, or rejection of consignments, and damage customer relationships. Such events may materially and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and overall business operations.\n\n**20. Any change in government policies relating to the textile or cotton sector, including Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), subsidies, or incentive schemes, may adversely affect our cost structure, supply chain, or customer demand, thereby impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition.**\n\nOur business performance is closely linked to agricultural and textile sector policies formulated by the Central and State Governments. Cotton is an agricultural commodity and is significantly affected by government interventions such as MSPs, procurement programs, input subsidies to farmers, and restrictions on cotton imports or exports. Any change in such measures may materially impact the availability, pricing, and quality of cotton in the domestic market, thereby affecting our procurement planning and cost structure.\n\nAdditionally, several government schemes and incentives, including the Textile PLI (Production Linked Incentive) scheme, the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS), National Textile Policy, 2000 and Gujarat Textile Policy, 2024, are critical for maintaining competitiveness in the spinning and textile value chain. A rollback, reduction, delay, or uncertainty in the implementation of such schemes could increase operating costs or reduce profitability across the industry. Conversely, the introduction of new subsidy schemes could intensify competition, as existing and new players may undertake fresh capital investments, thereby increasing overall industry capacity and putting pressure on margins.\n\nBeyond cotton pricing and textile-specific incentives, the industry is also vulnerable to wider regulatory and policy shifts. Labour law reforms, changes in environmental compliance norms, and disruptions arising from political or social unrest in key cotton-growing or textile-manufacturing states could lead to volatility in raw material supply chains or demand patterns.\n\nWe cannot assure that current levels of government support or favourable policy frameworks will continue. Any future adverse change in MSPs, subsidies, export-import regulations, or incentive schemes may materially and adversely impact our business operations, revenues, margins, and financial performance.\n\n**21.
