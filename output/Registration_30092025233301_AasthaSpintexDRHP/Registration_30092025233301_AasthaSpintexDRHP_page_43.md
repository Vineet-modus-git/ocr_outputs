**11. Our ginning operations are seasonal in nature, which may result in variability in production, inventory management challenges, and lower in-house consumption of cotton bales, thereby exposing us to operational and financial risks.**

Raw cotton, the primary raw material for our ginning operations, is a seasonal crop available largely between October and March each year. Consequently, our ginning unit typically operates only for a period of approximately six to seven months during the cotton season, commencing in mid-September or October and continuing until March. During this period, we procure cotton in bulk from a large number of farmers and traders to meet both our in-season production requirements and to maintain stock for off-season sales.

The seasonal concentration of ginning operations creates several risks. First, we are required to make significant procurement commitments during the harvest period, which increases our dependence on availability of working capital and exposes us to fluctuations in cotton prices. Second, storing large inventories of cotton bales for off-season sales involves costs, requires robust storage infrastructure, and exposes us to risks of quality deterioration, pest infestation, or obsolescence during prolonged holding. Third, variations in the quality of raw cotton procured directly affect the grade of cotton bales produced. While superior quality cotton enables us to produce higher-grade cotton bales, such quality may not always align with the specifications required by our spinning unit, where consumption depends on yarn count and technical parameters. As a result, in-house utilization of cotton bales produced by our ginning unit is relatively lower, and a significant portion of the bales are sold in the market.

This seasonality and quality mismatch may lead to variability in production planning, reduced efficiency in vertical integration between our ginning and spinning operations, and reliance on external sales for monetization of cotton bales. Any disruption in the cotton season, whether due to adverse weather conditions, government policy interventions, or pricing volatility, may impair our ability to procure raw cotton, operate our ginning unit efficiently, or monetize the output. Such developments could adversely affect our operational performance, working capital cycle, cash flows, and overall financial condition.

**12. We procure our raw materials primarily from farmers, traders and other ginning mills located across Gujarat, and any disruption in this supply region could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.**

Our operations depend on the uninterrupted procurement of raw cotton (for ginning unit during cotton season period from October to March) and cotton bales (for spinning unit throughout the year), which are primarily sourced from farmers, traders and other ginning mills located across Gujarat. While this regional concentration allows us to reduce transportation costs and lead times, it also exposes us to supply chain risks in the event of adverse developments affecting the cotton market in Gujarat.

Factors such as fluctuations in cotton production due to climatic conditions, pest infestations, changes in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), government procurement or export restrictions, and regional labour unrest could materially affect the availability, pricing, or quality of cotton supplied from this region. Further, any disruption in logistics, regulatory interventions, or socio-political unrest within Gujarat may adversely impact our ability to source raw materials in a timely and cost-efficient manner.

As we do not maintain long-term contracts with our suppliers and generally procure raw materials through purchase orders, we may have limited ability to secure alternative sourcing arrangements on short notice if supply in Gujarat is constrained. Any prolonged disruption or adverse development in cotton availability in Gujarat could lead to increased procurement costs, production delays, underutilization of installed capacity, and ultimately, a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, and financial performance.

**13. Our business is subject to seasonal volatility on account of the nature of main raw material i.e. raw cotton as an agricultural commodity, and such seasonality may cause significant fluctuations in our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.**
