We have initiated the process of updating such documents with the relevant counterparties and authorities. However, there can be no assurance that all such changes will be completed in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or failure in updating these documents to reflect our current name may result in difficulties in relying on such approvals, complications in enforcing contractual rights, increased compliance costs, and potential regulatory or legal challenges. These factors may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

**51. Under-utilization of our manufacturing capacities, or our inability to effectively utilize our installed capacities, could adversely affect our business, prospects, and financial performance.**

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Manufacturing Facility at Halvad, Morbi, Gujarat has an installed capacity of 25,920 spindles across 15 compact ring spinning machines, a cotton yarn production capacity of 7,700 MT per annum, and an annual ginning capacity of 12,000 MT of cotton bales.

The following table sets forth the capacity utilization of the Company's products at our Manufacturing Facility for the specified periods:

Capacity utilization is calculated on the basis of installed production capacity and actual production for the respective financial periods. For further details, see "*Our Business – CapacityUtilization*" on page 165

Our capacity utilization is subject to fluctuations depending on factors such as market demand, seasonality in cotton procurement, availability and pricing of raw cotton, customer order visibility, competitive pricing dynamics, availability of skilled labour, maintenance shutdowns, and external disruptions. Prolonged under-utilization may result in sub-optimal usage of assets, lower economies of scale, and an increase in per unit production costs.

Although we have historically maintained near-optimal capacity utilization, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate at similar levels in the future. Any significant reduction in demand for cotton yarn or cotton bales, inability to procure cotton at viable prices, or failure to secure sufficient sales orders could lead to lower utilization of our Manufacturing Facility. This may affect our ability to absorb fixed overheads, erode margins, and impact our profitability. In the event of sustained under-utilization, we may also be unable to recover the investments made in our plant and machinery, while incurring increased maintenance and holding costs.

**52. Any non-compliance with the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and the Gujarat Legal Metrology (Enforcement) Rules, 2011 may expose us to penalties and regulatory actions, which could adversely affect our business and operations.**

Our operations include procuring raw cotton and cotton bales, processing them into yarn, and selling the finished yarn to domestic and international customers. In the course of business, we use weighing equipment and measuring instruments for the procurement, storage, and sale of cotton and cotton yarn. Such activities are governed by the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and the Gujarat Legal Metrology (Enforcement) Rules, 2011, which prescribe standards for weights and measures, licensing requirements for their use in trade, and mandatory verification and stamping by the Office of the Controller of Legal Metrology, Gujarat.

Any lapse in compliance with the above requirements such as usage of non-verified weighing equipment, expired verification certificates, or failure to obtain or renew the requisite licenses may attract monetary penalties, suspension or cancellation of licenses, and even seizure of goods being weighed or measured. Such actions could disrupt our procurement or sales processes, delay delivery schedules, and adversely affect our reputation with suppliers and customers.
