Consequently, our ginning unit typically operates only for a period of approximately six to seven months during the cotton season, commencing in mid-September or October and continuing until March. During this period, we procure cotton in bulk from a large number of farmers and traders to meet both our in-season production requirements and to maintain stock for off-season sales."}, {"bbox": [195, 711, 1457, 1003], "category": "Text", "text": "The seasonal concentration of ginning operations creates several risks. First, we are required to make significant procurement commitments during the harvest period, which increases our dependence on availability of working capital and exposes us to fluctuations in cotton prices. Second, storing large inventories of cotton bales for off-season sales involves costs, requires robust storage infrastructure, and exposes us to risks of quality deterioration, pest infestation, or obsolescence during prolonged holding. Third, variations in the quality of raw cotton procured directly affect the grade of cotton bales produced. While superior quality cotton enables us to produce higher-grade cotton bales, such quality may not always align with the specifications required by our spinning unit, where consumption depends on yarn count and technical parameters. As a result, in-house utilization of cotton bales produced by our ginning unit is relatively lower, and a significant portion of the bales are sold in the market."}, {"bbox": [195, 1030, 1457, 1226], "category": "Text", "text": "This seasonality and quality mismatch may lead to variability in production planning, reduced efficiency in vertical integration between our ginning and spinning operations, and reliance on external sales for monetization of cotton bales. Any disruption in the cotton season, whether due to adverse weather conditions, government policy interventions, or pricing volatility, may impair our ability to procure raw cotton, operate our ginning unit efficiently, or monetize the output.
