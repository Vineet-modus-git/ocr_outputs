are required to source the additional demand from third-party manufacturers and provide the same to the reseller. While this arrangement has worked effectively for over a decade, our reliance on a single reseller for majority of sales outside Gujarat and exports amplifies our dependency risk. Any change in the terms of engagement with 7 Seas Impex or operational or financial difficulties faced by this reseller could materially constrain our ability to access important domestic and international markets.

Although we have not experienced any disruption in sales under this arrangement, there can be no assurance that such stability will continue in the future. Any adverse development relating to 7 Seas Impex or its ability to perform its obligations under the exclusivity agreement could materially and adversely affect our revenues, cash flows, business operations, and financial performance.

## 2. Our proposed utilisation of a portion of the Net Proceeds towards payment of the purchase consideration for the acquisition of Falcon Yarns Private Limited exposes us to funding, timing, and integration risks.

Pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated September 22, 2025 (the "Falcon SPA"), our Company has agreed to acquire 100% of the equity share capital of Falcon Yarns Private Limited ("Falcon") from its existing shareholders for an aggregate cash consideration of up to ₹ 13,151 lakhs. As set out in the Falcon SPA, the consideration is payable in three parts: (i) ₹ 1,000 lakhs payable by September 20, 2025 or such other date as mutually agreed between Falcon and our Company, which has already been paid by our Company as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus; (ii) ₹ 1,000 lakhs payable prior to January 1, 2026 or such other date as mutually agreed between Falcon and our Company; and (iii) the balance consideration of up to ₹ 11,151 lakhs payable within 30 days post completion of our proposed initial public offering. We propose to utilise a portion of the Net Proceeds of the Issue for the payment of this balance consideration.

In the event of a delay or shortfall in raising funds from the Issue, we may face challenges in discharging the balance purchase consideration payable under the Falcon SPA within the stipulated timelines. In such circumstances, we would be required to arrange alternate funding through internal accruals, additional debt, or further equity issuance, which may not be available on favourable terms or within the required timeframe. Any failure or delay in making the required payments could constitute a default under the Falcon SPA, expose us to legal and financial consequences, and adversely impact our acquisition strategy.

Further, while we believe the acquisition of Falcon will provide synergies with our existing operations and expand our scope of business, there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits will be realised in the expected time frame, or at all. Integration of Falcon's operations with our own may involve unforeseen risks, costs, and liabilities, and our consolidated financial results will also be exposed to the operational performance of Falcon. The Falcon SPA provides only limited representations and warranties from the sellers, which may limit our recourse in the event of undisclosed liabilities or operational issues.

Accordingly, any delay in completing the payment of consideration, inability to arrange alternative funding, or failure to integrate Falcon effectively may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. For further details, see the chapters titled "Objects of the Issue – Payment of Purchase Consideration for the Acquisition of Falcon Yarns Private Limited" and "Our Business" on pages 106 and 156 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

## 3. We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for procurement of raw cotton and cotton bales, our principal raw material, and any disruption in supply or adverse movement in cotton prices may materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Raw cotton and cotton bales are the principal raw material used in our manufacturing operations and constitute the single largest component of our production costs. Our ability to remain cost competitive and operationally efficient is closely linked to the procurement of raw cotton and cotton bales in adequate quantities, of consistent quality, and at commercially viable terms. Our factory is located within major cotton growing area of Gujarat and hence, we procures raw cotton from farmers and traders for processing at our ginning unit for production of cotton bales. In addition, we source cotton bales for our spinning unit from other ginning mills and traders across Gujarat, which helps reduce transportation costs, shorten lead times, and support timely production. Over the years, we have built relationships with the farmers and a network of reliable suppliers; during the last three Fiscals, we procured cotton bales from more than 125 Suppliers out of which 8 suppliers are in top 10 suppliers where 6 Suppliers are associated with us over 5 years and top 10 suppliers contribute 73.05 %, 79.62 % and 44.30% of the total purchase during the last three fiscals.
