62. Our business operations are subject to extensive environmental, health, and safety regulations, and any failure to comply with such regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our manufacturing processes involve handling of raw cotton, cotton bales, and other by-products that are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These include requirements relating to air quality, dust emissions, solid waste disposal, effluent discharge, water consumption, noise levels, and fire safety. Accordingly, we are required to obtain and maintain approvals such as Consents and Authorizations from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, as well as other permits and clearances relating to storage, disposal of by-products, and compliance with workplace safety standards.

Environmental regulations in India, including those applicable to the textile sector, are evolving and are expected to become more stringent with the government's increased emphasis on sustainable manufacturing, energy efficiency, and resource conservation. Any tightening of norms relating to effluent treatment, dust emissions, or disposal of cotton waste and by-products may require us to incur significant capital expenditure for new pollution control equipment, modifications to existing processes, or adoption of new technologies.

Further, our operations depend on natural resources such as water and power, both of which are subject to usage restrictions and regulatory oversight. Any adverse changes in regulations, stricter enforcement, or failure to obtain or renew the required approvals could result in higher compliance costs, penalties, reputational harm, suspension of approvals, or even temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facility.

While we endeavour to comply with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws, we cannot assure you that inadvertent non-compliances will not occur in the future. Any failure to comply with such regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.

63. Compliance with stringent environmental, health, and safety laws may lead to higher capital expenditures.

Our business operations are subject to a comprehensive framework of Central and State environmental laws and regulations in India, which govern pollution control and environmental protection. These regulations address the discharge of chemicals, dust, and other pollutants into the air, soil, or water. Any non-compliance with these regulations, including emissions exceeding prescribed limits, may result in liability for environmental damage and require us to implement remedial measures, potentially leading to increased costs.

Given the evolving nature of environmental regulations in India, compliance requirements may become more stringent over time. Amendments introducing more rigorous standards, stricter enforcement mechanisms, or enhanced regulatory scrutiny could necessitate significant capital expenditures for pollution control measures and compliance-related infrastructure. Such developments could impact our operational efficiency, increase costs, and adversely affect our financial condition and business prospects.

While we are currently not involved in any environmental legal proceedings, there is no assurance that we will remain unaffected in the future. Any potential litigation or regulatory action concerning environmental compliance could lead to financial liabilities, diversion of management attention, and operational disruptions. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully resolve all such matters in our favor, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.

64. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, working capital requirements, capital expenditure, and restrictive covenants in our financing arrangements.

We may retain all our future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of our business. As a result, we may not declare dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination regarding the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on factors that the Board of Directors deem relevant, including, among others, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, business prospects, and any other financing arrangements. For details of our dividend history, please refer to the Chapter titled "Dividend Policy" on page 219 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

65. Our future fund requirements, in the form of the issue of capital or securities and/or loans taken by us, may be prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders depending upon the terms on which they are eventually raised.
