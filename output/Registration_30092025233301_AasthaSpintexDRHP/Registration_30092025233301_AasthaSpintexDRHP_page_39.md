revenue from sale of products respectively, with the top five customers accounting for over 51.66%, 79.05% and 75.47% of our total revenue from sale of products in each of these periods. In particular, our largest customer, 7 Seas Impex (a reseller for domestic sales outside Gujarat and export sales), accounted for 33.88%, 54.73% and 66.61% of our total revenue from sale of products in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively.

The table below sets forth the revenue from our top five and top ten customers in the last three fiscals:

Except for 7 Seas Impex, we do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers, and our sales are primarily conducted through individual purchase orders that set out terms, volumes and delivery schedules. The absence of long-term commitments exposes us to the risk of customer retention and creates uncertainty in production planning. If one or more of our key customers reduce their orders, cease to source from us, or are unable to perform their obligations due to financial distress, insolvency, business restructuring, regulatory actions, or shifts in procurement policies, our revenue and profitability could be materially impacted.

Moreover, as we expand our customer base, the composition of our revenue may change. Any adverse development involving one or more of our major customers including reduction in order volumes, disputes, discontinuation of business, or adoption of alternative suppliers could have a significant effect on our revenues, cash flows and liquidity. Our reliance on our reseller, 7 Seas Impex, for facilitating sales outside Gujarat and exports further amplifies this dependency risk. If this reseller were to change the terms of our engagement or face operational or financial difficulties, our access to key domestic and international markets could be adversely affected.

Although we have not experienced a material loss of a key customer in last 3 Fiscals, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing customers, secure equivalent replacement customers on comparable terms, or continue to maintain the current level of revenues. Any such event could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

5. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from cotton yarns, particularly carded, combed, and compact combed varieties, and cotton bales, and any adverse development in demand, pricing, or industry conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are engaged in the business of manufacturing and trading of carded, combed and compact combed cotton yarns and cotton bales. Our product portfolio includes 100% cotton yarns in counts ranging from Ne 26 to Ne 40, cotton bales, cotton waste by-products such as comber, licker-in, and hard waste and cotton seeds, which is by-product during the ginning process for production of cotton bales. These yarns are used across knitting and weaving applications and cater to a wide range of end-use industries including denim, terry towels, shirting, sheeting, sweaters, socks, bottom wear, home textiles and industrial fabrics. While we also generate revenue from cotton bales, cotton seeds and cotton waste by-products, a significant portion of our total revenue is concentrated in cotton yarn sales, specifically carded, combed and compact combed yarns.
