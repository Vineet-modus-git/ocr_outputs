**44. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, including our trademarks, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our business, reputation, and goodwill.**

Building recognition for our brand and maintaining its distinctiveness is critical to our business, as it enables us to compete effectively in domestic and export markets. Our brand name and logo are important in establishing trust with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has registered the following trademark with the Registrar of Trademarks under the Trademarks Act, 1999:

<table><thead><tr><td>Sr. No.</td><td>Name of the IPR registration/ license</td><td>Type of Trademark</td><td>Registration Number</td><td>Date of registration/ application</td><td>Class</td><td>Status</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>AASTHA Spintex*</td><td>Device</td><td>2937732</td><td>April 9, 2015</td><td>23</td><td>Registered</td></tr></tbody></table>

*As on the date of this DRHP, the online records of the Trademarks Registry reflect the proprietor's name as 'Aastha Spintex Private Limited'. An application dated July 10, 2025, has been submitted to record the change of name from 'Private Limited' to 'Public Limited' with the Trademarks Registry, and approval is awaited. The trademark proprietor details will be updated to reflect the new name upon approval.

Our rights to use this registered trademark are subject to renewal at periodic intervals. Any failure to renew such registration may impair our right to use the mark in future. Further, while we have made efforts to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that our measures will be adequate. Unregistered or unprotected elements of our intellectual property may be vulnerable to third-party claims, which could result in erosion of our business value and reputation.

Third parties may attempt to infringe, imitate, or misuse our registered trademark, brand name, or logo. We may not always be able to detect such unauthorised use or take timely and effective legal action to prevent it. The use of deceptively similar or identical marks by competitors or other parties could mislead customers, dilute our brand equity, and result in loss of reputation or business opportunities.

Although we have not encountered any unauthorised use or infringement of our intellectual property during the last three Fiscals, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property in the future. Any failure to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights, or defend against third-party claims, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and goodwill. For further details, see the section titled "Government and Other Statutory Approvals" on page 308 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

**45. Our business depends on our ability to consistently maintain stringent quality standards. Any failure to meet customer-prescribed specifications may result in product rejections, order cancellations, reputational harm, and adverse impact on our financial performance.**

We are engaged in the manufacturing and trading of carded, combed and compact combed cotton yarns and cotton bales, which are primarily supplied to textile manufacturers, yarn exporters, bulk purchasers, and fabric processors in the B2B segment. These buyers often operate under strict technical parameters driven by both domestic and export market requirements. Our customers prescribe benchmarks relating to strength, uniformity, twist, elongation, and appearance. Consistent adherence to these specifications is critical to sustaining long-term relationships and repeat orders.

Our spinning operations at Halvad, Morbi, Gujarat involve multiple interdependent processes including opening, cleaning, carding, combing, spinning, winding, and final packaging. Each stage requires precision, skilled manpower, and continuous monitoring. Variations in raw cotton quality, equipment malfunction, operator error, or deviation from prescribed process norms may result in defects such as unevenness, excessive hairiness, or low tensile strength. Such defects could lead to rejection of consignments, customer complaints, cancellation of orders, or erosion of our reputation in the textile value chain.

Our reputation in both domestic and export-linked markets is closely tied to our ability to deliver cotton yarns that meet consistent and reliable quality standards. Customers may conduct internal testing or engage accredited third-party laboratories before accepting shipments, and in many cases, we are required to provide samples for technical evaluation before bulk orders. Any failure to meet these benchmarks at the sample stage, during pre-dispatch
