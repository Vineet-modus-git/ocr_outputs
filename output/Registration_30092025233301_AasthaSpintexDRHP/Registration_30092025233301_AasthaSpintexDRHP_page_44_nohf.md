Our business is primarily dependent on cotton, while raw cotton is available only during specific harvest period in India i.e. from October to March. The procurement cycle is concentrated during the harvest season, when cotton and cotton bales can be purchased in bulk and generally at more favorable terms. In contrast, during the off-season, the supply raw cotton is not possible and that of cotton bales becomes constrained, and prices are subject to significant fluctuations. This seasonality affects our procurement strategy and results in varying stocking requirements, which in turn impacts our working capital cycle and cost structure.

As a result, our revenues and profitability may be higher in certain quarters and lower in others, and the results of any one period may not accurately indicate the overall performance of our Company for a full financial year. Adverse weather conditions or unexpected disruptions in the cotton supply chain may further intensify these seasonal variations. While we adopt diligent procurement and inventory practices to mitigate such volatility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage these seasonal fluctuations effectively or that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**14. Our dependence on cotton exposes us to risks of price volatility, supply chain disruptions, and changes in government policies on cotton, which may materially affect our cost structure and margins.**

Raw cotton and cotton bales constitute a major portion of our input costs. The price and availability of raw cotton and cotton bales are influenced by factors beyond our control, including crop yields, climatic conditions, pest infestations, government policies such as minimum support price (MSP), restrictions on exports or imports, and global demand-supply imbalances. Any increase in cotton prices or shortage in supply could materially raise our cost of production and compress our operating margins, especially in a competitive industry where increase in cost cannot always be passed on to customers. Our procurement arrangements are primarily short-term, and we do not have long-term supply contracts that guarantee fixed pricing or assured availability. This leaves us exposed to spot market fluctuations.

Although we maintain good relationships with multiple vendors and brokers and adopt procurement planning practices, there can be no assurance that such measures will insulate us from supply-side disruptions or price volatility, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**15. We have certain contingent liabilities which, if materialized, may adversely affect our financial condition.**

As of March 31, 2025, our contingent liabilities is as under:

(Amount in ₹ Lakhs)

<table><thead><tr><th>Contingent Liabilities and Commitments</th><th>As at 31st March 2025</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bank Guarantee given to PGVCL</td><td>239.31</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>239.31</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

In the event any such contingencies mentioned above were to materialize or if our contingent liabilities were to increase in the future, our financial condition could be adversely affected. For further details, see the section entitled “Summary of Issue Document-Summary of contingent liabilities” and “Restated Financial Statements” on page 21 and page 220 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus respectively.

**16. Delays or defaults in payments by our customers could increase our working capital requirements, impact our cash flows, and adversely affect our financial performance and condition.**

We are engaged in the business of manufacturing and trading of carded, combed, and compact combed cotton yarns as well as cotton bales. Our sales are primarily undertaken on a credit basis, and we are exposed to the risk of delays or defaults in customer payments. Our ability to maintain a stable cash flow and liquidity position depends on the creditworthiness and timely payment behaviour of our customers. Any delay or default in payments, particularly where we have already deployed resources for fulfilling orders, can increase receivables, extend our working capital cycle, and adversely affect our operating cash flows.
