Cash flow of a company is a key indicator to show the extent of cash generated from operations to meet capital expenditure, pay dividends, repay loans and make new investments without raising finance from external resources. Our inability to generate and sustain adequate cash flows in the future could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For further please refer chapter titled "Restated Financial Information" beginning on Page 220 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

**9. Our Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is a key indicator of our ability to service debt obligations, and any weakening of this ratio may adversely affect our financial flexibility and overall business performance.**

Our DSCR reflects the extent to which our internal accruals are sufficient to meet scheduled debt servicing obligations. A DSCR below 1.00x indicates that internal cash accruals from operations are insufficient to fully cover scheduled debt obligations, necessitating reliance on refinancing, improved operating performance, or alternative funding arrangements.

Set forth below is a summary of our DSCR analysis for the last three Fiscals:

<table><thead><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Fiscal 2025</td><td>Fiscal 2024</td><td>Fiscal 2023</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Debt Service Coverage Ratio</td><td>2.37</td><td>1.35</td><td>0.65</td></tr></tbody></table>

As reflected above, our DSCR has improved in Fiscal 2025 to 2.37x, compared to 1.35x in Fiscal 2024 and 0.65x in Fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher internal accruals resulted from improvement in profitability as compared to debt obligations due for payment during the corresponding financial year. This demonstrates a positive trend; however, there can be no assurance that such improvement will be sustained in the future.

A sustained DSCR at or below 1.00x will require us to raise alternate source of funds to meet our debt obligation and funds for operations at the same time may constrain our financial flexibility, restrict our ability to raise incremental borrowings on favourable terms, and adversely affect our credit profile. In such circumstances, we may be required to provide additional collateral, accept more stringent covenants, or bear higher borrowing costs. Further, any increase in raw material costs, higher interest expenses, or decline in revenue could exert additional pressure on our DSCR.

If we are unable to maintain or further improve our DSCR through operational efficiencies, cost optimization, or capital structure adjustments, we may be exposed to risks of delayed repayments, penal interest, or enforcement of security by lenders. Any such development may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

**10. Cotton is a highly flammable commodity, and any fire, accident, or mishap at our facilities could result in significant property damage, business interruption, and financial loss.**

Cotton is highly flammable, combustible and susceptible to ignition at almost every stage of handling, including procurement, storage, processing, transportation, and trading. The risk of fire is particularly acute in areas such as the ginning unit, blow room and carding section, where fine cotton dust accumulates and increase the likelihood of sparks or short circuits leading to an outbreak. With the use of high-volume air circulation and semi-automated material-handling systems for handling large volumes of cotton, the probability of fire or a small incident in one section can rapidly spread across machines and production lines.

An outbreak of fire or similar accident at our manufacturing facility could result in extensive damage to raw material inventory, finished goods, plant, and machinery. Such an event may also cause injury to workers, attract compensation claims, and lead to regulatory scrutiny or suspension of operations. Beyond the immediate property loss, prolonged business interruption may impair our ability to service customer orders, erode trust and materially reduce our revenues and profitability.

Although we have not experienced any major fire incident in the past and have taken adequate insurance policies for raw material, stock in process and finished stock covering fire-related losses, coverage may not be adequate
