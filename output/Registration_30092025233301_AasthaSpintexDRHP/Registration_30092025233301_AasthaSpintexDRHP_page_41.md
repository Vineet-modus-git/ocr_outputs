c. **Contravention of Section 138 of the Companies Act (Appointment of Internal Auditor):** For Financial Years 2021-22 to 2023-24, our Company failed to appoint an Internal Auditor despite being required to do so under Section 138 of the Companies Act read with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, on account of its turnover and borrowings.

Our Company subsequently appointed Ms. Anita Lalwani as Company Secretary with effect from June 1, 2016. The Company filed Form No. GNL-1 on September 27, 2025, bearing SRN No. AB7629058 with the RoC, Gujarat at Ahmedabad, for a suo moto adjudication application under Section 454 of the Companies Act, 2013, in respect of non-compliance under Section 203 of the Companies Act, 2013.

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, no penalties have yet been imposed in respect of the above matters. However, we cannot assure you that the Registrar of Companies or other competent authorities will not levy fines, impose penalties, or initiate other regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings in connection with such defaults. While our Company has taken steps to strengthen its compliance and governance framework, there can be no assurance that similar lapses will not occur in the future or that such non-compliances, if they arise, will be addressed in a timely manner. Any adverse regulatory orders, monetary penalties, or recurrence of non-compliance could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

**7. Our acquisition-driven growth strategy, including the acquisition of Falcon Yarns Private Limited, exposes us to risks of integration, hidden liabilities, and increased financial commitments.**

As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand our business through acquisitions that complement our operations, enlarge our value chain, and provide access to new customers, products, and markets. In line with this strategy, we have agreed to acquire Falcon Yarns Private Limited. While acquisitions present opportunities for growth and diversification, they also expose us to a number of risks, including:

* unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities in the acquired entity, due to the limited scope of representations and warranties;
* challenges in integrating operations, systems, controls, and personnel of the acquired company with our own;
* diversion of management time and resources from existing business operations;
* potential cultural differences or operational inefficiencies during consolidation; and
* increased financial commitments arising from acquisition-related payments or additional debt.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate acquisitions on favourable terms or achieve the expected benefits and synergies within the anticipated timeframe. If we fail to integrate Falcon Yarns or any future acquisition effectively, or if the acquired business does not perform in line with expectations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

**8. We have experienced negative cash flows in the past. Any such negative cash flows in the future could affect our business, results of operations and prospects.**

Our Company had reported certain negative cash flows from our operating, investing activities and financing activities in the previous years as per the Restated Financial Statements and the same are summarized as under:
