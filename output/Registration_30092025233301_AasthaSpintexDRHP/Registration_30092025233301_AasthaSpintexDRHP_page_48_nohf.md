While we have not experienced any material operational disruptions at our Manufacturing Facility in preceding three Fiscal years. Any significant disruption at our Manufacturing Facility could delay production, result in inventory build-up, impair our ability to meet customer orders, and disrupt our supply chain. These factors could lead to order cancellations, contractual penalties, customer attrition, and reputational harm, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. Given the absence of geographic diversification in both our operations and customer base, any adverse event impacting the state of Gujarat may have a material and disproportionate effect on our overall business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

**25. Continued operations at our Manufacturing Facility are critical to our business, and any disruption could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.**

We operate through our semi-automated and integrated ginning and spinning manufacturing facility located at Halvad, Morbi, Gujarat. Our Manufacturing Facility is central to our operations, and any disruption may have a direct adverse impact on our ability to procure cotton bales, produce yarn, and deliver products to our customers on time. For details of our facility, see "*Our Business – Our Manufacturing Facility*" on page 164 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

The facility is subject to a number of operating risks, including breakdown or failure of critical equipment, interruptions in power supply, labour disputes, natural disasters, industrial accidents, fire hazards, or the need to comply with directives of governmental and regulatory authorities. Any significant malfunction or breakdown of machinery could entail substantial repair or replacement costs, lead to suspension or slowdown of operations, and result in underutilization of installed capacity. Further, delays in addressing such disruptions could cause us to miss delivery schedules, adversely affecting our customer relationships and reputation in the market.

Although we have not experienced any material disruption at our Manufacturing Facility in last three Fiscals, we cannot assure you that such events will not occur in the future. Any prolonged or repeated disruption at our Manufacturing Facility may materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows, and overall financial condition.

**26. Our business is dependent on the adequate and uninterrupted supply of power and water at a reasonable cost, and any shortage or increase in cost may adversely impact our operations and profitability.**

Our manufacturing operations are power-intensive and require continuous and reliable electricity to run our machinery at optimal capacity. We have access to the necessary utilities such as air, electricity, and water at our manufacturing facility in Halvad, Morbi, Gujarat. Our power requirements are met partly through renewable energy and partly through grid supply. Specifically, our facility is supported by an installed 1 MW rooftop solar power unit, a 4 MW ground-mounted solar power plant, and a 2.7 MW wind power plant, in addition to power drawn from our connection with PGVCL (Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited). During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, solar and wind power together constituted 80% of our total power consumption.

Despite these measures, we remain exposed to risks relating to fluctuations in power availability, grid outages, variability in renewable energy generation, and increases in per-unit power costs. Any material increase in tariffs or reduction in renewable energy benefits may raise our operating expenses, and we may not always be able to pass such increases on to our customers, which could impact our margins.

Our operations also depend on the adequate supply of water, which is typically met through borewells and third-party sources, supported by storage tanks within our facility. Any shortage in water availability, deterioration in quality, or increase in associated costs may disrupt production schedules, impair product quality, or necessitate additional expenditure on alternative sourcing.

While we have invested in renewable energy assets and water storage facilities to minimize such risks, there can be no assurance that we will always have access to adequate and cost-effective power and water. Any disruption or material increase in costs of these critical inputs may adversely affect our capacity utilization, business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

**27. Our investments in renewable energy assets such as wind turbines and solar plants involve significant capital costs, ongoing maintenance, and lifecycle risks, which may reduce the expected benefits of such projects.**

We have made substantial investments in renewable energy infrastructure, including wind turbines, ground-mounted solar plants, and rooftop solar panels, to cater to our captive power requirements. These assets involve
