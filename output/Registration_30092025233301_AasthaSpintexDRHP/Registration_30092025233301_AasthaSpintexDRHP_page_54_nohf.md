The demand for our products such as carded, combed and compact combed cotton yarns and cotton bales is closely linked to trends in the domestic and international textile industries. Our yarns are used in both weaving and knitting applications, catering to a broad range of end-use segments including denim, shirting, home textiles, terry towels, sweaters, socks, and industrial fabrics. The consumption of cotton yarn is influenced by macroeconomic conditions, growth in apparel and home textile industries, urbanisation, household income levels, and export demand from global buyers. Any slowdown in economic growth, reduction in disposable incomes, or contraction in consumer spending could adversely affect demand for downstream textile products, which in turn may reduce demand for our yarns and bales.

The demand for cotton yarn is also sensitive to government interventions such as changes in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), procurement policies, export restrictions, or modifications in import duties on cotton. Unfavourable changes in such policies could affect both the cost and availability of raw cotton and the competitiveness of cotton yarn compared to synthetic or blended yarn alternatives. In addition, the continuation or withdrawal of industry schemes and incentives, such the Textile PLI (Production Linked Incentive) scheme, the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS), may impact sectoral competitiveness and demand.

In international markets, our sales are exposed to factors such as global cotton price movements, exchange rate fluctuations, changes in trade policies of importing countries, tariff or non-tariff barriers, and shifting customer preferences toward man-made fibres. Geopolitical tensions, regulatory restrictions, or global trade disruptions could also impact export volumes routed through our reseller.

Given the concentration of our revenues in cotton yarn and bales, any sustained downturn in demand whether due to economic slowdown, consumer preference shifts, policy changes, or adverse global trade developments may materially and adversely affect our growth prospects, revenues, profitability, cash flows, and overall financial condition.

**42. Our growth is directly linked to the performance of the textile and apparel industry, and any slowdown or shift in demand within these segments may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.**

We are engaged in the manufacture of cotton yarn, which serves as an intermediate product in the textile value chain. Our yarn is primarily used by fabric manufacturers and subsequently in the production of apparel, garments, home textiles, and other end uses. Accordingly, the demand for our products is closely tied to the growth, consumption patterns, and competitiveness of the textile and apparel sectors, both in domestic and export markets.

The cotton yarn industry faces intense competition from man-made and synthetic yarns, which have gained wider acceptance due to evolving fashion trends, cost advantages, and government incentives for man-made fiber-based textiles. Any shift in consumer preference from cotton to synthetics, or prolonged downturn in the domestic or international apparel markets, could directly affect the demand for our products. In such circumstances, our sales volumes, pricing power, and profitability may come under pressure. There can be no assurance that growth in the textile and apparel industry will remain robust, or that demand for cotton yarn will not decline in favor of substitutes. Any such slowdown or shift in demand may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**43. Our inability to maintain an optimal level of inventory may adversely affect our operations, working capital, and ability to meet customer demand.**

Our operations are heavily dependent on maintaining adequate inventory levels of raw materials and finished goods, which in turn are determined by projected sales and seasonal procurement cycles. Maintaining optimal inventory is critical to ensuring timely production, meeting customer orders, and sustaining consistent sales.

If we overstock inventory, our working capital requirements increase, and we are exposed to risks of higher storage costs, deterioration or obsolescence of stock, and pressure on liquidity. Conversely, if we understock inventory, we may not be able to respond to customer demand on time, resulting in potential loss of sales, strained customer relationships, and reduced market share. Further, any mismatch between our demand forecasts and the actual offtake by customers could disrupt production planning and adversely affect our operating performance. However, we adopt inventory monitoring practices, there can be no assurance that our inventory levels will always remain optimal, and any such imbalance may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
