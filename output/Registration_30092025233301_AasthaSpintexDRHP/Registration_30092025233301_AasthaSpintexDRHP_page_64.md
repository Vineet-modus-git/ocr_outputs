We may require additional capital from time to time based on our business needs. Any issuance of shares could lead to the dilution of the shareholding of existing shareholders, and such issuances may occur on terms and conditions that may not be favorable to the current shareholders. If such funds are raised in the form of loans or debt, it could substantially increase our interest burden, thereby reducing our cash flows. This may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.

**66. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly or deviate adversely from our past performance.**

Our operating results may vary significantly in the future and may not align with past performance due to several factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in demand for our products, shifts in market conditions, challenges in maintaining strategic alliances, and unforeseen operational or economic disruptions. Consequently, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected, particularly if growth in product demand declines or if strategic partnerships fail to yield expected benefits or become unprofitable. As a result, our future performance may exhibit fluctuations or deviate materially from past trends, making it inherently unpredictable.
