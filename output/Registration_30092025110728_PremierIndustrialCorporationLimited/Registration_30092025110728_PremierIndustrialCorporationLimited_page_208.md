with higher purchasing power and growing demand for welding consumables, thereby improving our margins. Our strategy includes strengthening global customer relationships, enhancing visibility through trade fairs, appointing distributor(s) / external consultants, investing in localized supply chains, and leveraging our sales and marketing network to expand into Vietnam, Ukraine, Russia, Australia, Germany, United Kingdom and other regions. We have also entered into warehousing arrangements with warehouse operator in USA to facilitate storage and movement of our products.

We believe our proven ability to meet international specifications and customer requirements positions us well to capture higher-margin opportunities. In addition, global supply chain realignments, including the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, create potential for India to emerge as an attractive sourcing alternative. According to the CRISIL Report, this pattern suggests an accelerating shift in global economic gravity toward emerging markets, with India positioned to be a primary driver of global growth. By continuing to diversify geographically, both within India and internationally, we expect to strengthen our brand presence, enhance revenue visibility, and mitigate risks associated with economic fluctuations in any single region.

### Penetration into existing customer base

### Driving operational efficiency through Backward Integration

In order to improve our operational efficiencies, we intend to implement backward integration measures by manufacturing products such as ferro chrome low carbon, ferro molybdenum, ferro titanium at our Wada Unit which will be consumed captively by our Company as a raw material in the process of manufacturing powder. These backward integration measures will allow us to gain competitive advantage. With backward integration measures, we will be in a position to control the quality and availability of some of our raw materials which in turn will reduce reliance on external suppliers and enhance our ability to negotiate more favourable pricing from customers.

These backward integration measures are expected to strengthen our supply chain, improve cost efficiency and minimize supply failure risks. By exercising greater control over the sourcing of critical raw materials, we believe we will be better positioned to manage lead times, mitigate production delays, and deliver products to customers on competitive timelines and at optimal cost.

Our product range can be categorized as under:

1. Powders

2. Wires

#### Powders

Metal and ferro alloy Powder play a critical role in enhancing the performance and quality of various welding processes in the welding consumables industry. These powders are integral components in several products, including electrodes, wires and fluxes, each serving a unique purpose in welding applications.

This segment includes manufacturing of metal, ferro alloy, mineral and chemical powders as per customer requirements. The metal and ferro alloy Powder are used either directly in welding or form a part of the flux powder used in the welding consumables industry. Some of the major category of metal, ferro alloy, mineral and chemical powders which are additives to flux coatings/fillers along their respective properties are as below:
