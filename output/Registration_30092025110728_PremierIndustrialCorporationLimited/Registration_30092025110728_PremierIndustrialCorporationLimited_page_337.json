The Profit After Tax (PAT) for the financial year 2023-24 reached ₹ 335.68 million, marking an increase from ₹ 126.69 million in the financial year 2022-23. In the financial year 2023-24, PAT constituted 9.78% of the total income, in contrast to 3.38% in the financial year 2022-23. The company achieved a PAT margin of 9.89% in financial year 2023-24 compared to 3.42% in financial year 2022-23, representing a significant improvement of 6.47%. This enhancement can be primarily attributed to decrease in the raw material cost from domestic vendors year on year. During the financial year 2024, the procurement cost per metric tonnes from domestic vendors was ₹ 157.96 as compared to ₹ 193.48 for the financial year 2023. This was mainly due to the raw material costs going down in that year and because of which, we could save up to 22.49% in procurement costs. Our procurement of raw material from domestic vendors went up in this period from 79.95% to 85.48%. The decline in raw material costs led to a decrease in the selling price of finished goods per metric ton, but the reduction in selling price was less significant compared to the drop in raw material costs. As far as the change in revenue is concerned, the quantity sold in metric tonnes saw a growth of 6.77%. This emphasis that there was no decline in sales volume and the resultant decline in raw material cost led to the increase in profitability. The company also saw this as an opportunity to capitalise this decrease in cost of raw material procurement and bought inventory in excess to cater to the growing demand of the manufactured product. The Inventory at the end of the year was ₹ 1,161.53 million of raw material and for finished goods, it was ₹ 142.95 million. The movement in the profit and loss for the inventory was the primary reason for increase in the profit for the financial year."}, {"bbox": [197, 1671, 326, 1699], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Cash Flow"}, {"bbox": [197, 1734, 1454, 1797], "category": "Text", "text": "The table below summarizes our cash flows from our Restated Financial Information for the financial years ended in 2025, 2024, and 2023:"}, {"bbox": [197, 1821, 1452, 2136], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>Fiscal 2025</th><th>Fiscal 2024</th><th>Fiscal 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net cash (used in)/ Generated from operating activities</td><td>(113.74)</td><td>176.76</td><td>68.75</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash (used in)/ Generated from investing activities</td><td>(70.42)</td><td>33.76</td><td>(34.55)</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash (used in)/ Generated from finance activities</td><td>110.46</td><td>(158.81)</td><td>(54.17)</td></tr><tr><td>Net increase/ (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents</td><td>(73.70)</td><td>(51.71)</td><td>(19.96)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and Cash Equivalents at the beginning of the period</td><td>87.65</td><td>35.93</td><td>55.90</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and Cash Equivalents at the end of period</td><td>13.95</td><td>87.65</td><td>35.93</td></tr></tbody></table>"}]
