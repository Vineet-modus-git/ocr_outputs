consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, price concessions, incentives, and returns, if any, as specified in the contracts with the customers. Revenue excludes taxes collected from customers on behalf of the government. Accruals for discounts/incentives and returns are estimated (using the most likely method) based on accumulated experience and underlying schemes and agreements with customers. Due to the short nature of credit period given to customers, there is no financing component in the contract.

## ii) Other operating revenue

Export incentive entitlements are recognised as income when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds. These are presented as other operating income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## iii) Other Income

1) Dividend and interest income:

Dividend income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying amount on initial recognition.

2) Rental Income – Rental income from investment property under operating lease recognized as and when it accrues.

3) Insurance claims_ Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis of claims admitted / expected to be admitted and to the extent that there is no uncertainty in receiving the claims.

## k) EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted for treasury shares held. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for options, except where the results would be anti-dilutive. The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any splits and bonus shares issues including for change effected prior to the approval of the Financial Statements by the Board of Directors.

## l) LEASES

The Company evaluates each contract or arrangement, whether it qualifies as lease as defined under Ind AS 116.

### The Company as a lessee

The Company makes an assessment of the lease at the time of inception of a contract and if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for consideration, same is recognised as Lease liability. The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

### Lease Liabilities

At the initial recognition, the Company measures lease liabilities at present value of all lease payments discounted, using the Company's incremental cost of borrowing, to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.
