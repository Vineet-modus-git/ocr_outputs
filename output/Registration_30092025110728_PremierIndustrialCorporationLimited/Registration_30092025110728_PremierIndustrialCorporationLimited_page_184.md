2. **Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) fluxes:** The process involves fluxes incorporated within the core of flux-cored welding wires, providing shielding and other benefits.

* **Types:**
  - **Self-shielded flux-cored wires:** Contain flux that generates its own shielding gas, eliminating the need for an external gas supply
  - **Gas-shielded flux-cored wires:** Require an external shielding gas, in addition to the flux within the wire. The type offers improved weld quality and reduced spatter
* **Applications:** Versatile welding applications, including construction, automotive and heavy equipment

3. **Others:** Other categories include fluxes used in Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and other specialty fluxes. The share of such fluxes is less than 5% of overall Fluxes used directly in the welding processes.

Various types of shielding gas used in the welding industry are as follows:
