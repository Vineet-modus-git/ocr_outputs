## Logistics

Roadways and waterways are the modes of transportation used for our raw materials as well as finished products. If urgency warrants, we also use airways as a mode of transport. Our suppliers directly deliver our raw materials to our units.

We do not own any vehicles for the transportation of our products and/or raw materials; we therefore rely on third party transportation and logistics providers for delivery of our raw materials and products. Further, we do not have any long-term contractual arrangements with such third-party transportation and logistics providers. Disruptions of logistics could impair our ability to procure raw materials and/or deliver our products on time.
