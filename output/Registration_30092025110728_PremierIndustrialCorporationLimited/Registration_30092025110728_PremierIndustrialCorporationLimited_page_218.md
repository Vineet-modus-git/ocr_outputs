## Technical Collaborations

Our Company does not have any technical collaboration as on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

## Competition

We operate in the welding consumables industry which is highly competitive and fragmented, and we compete with a range of unorganized players, at the national and regional level. As per CRISIL Report, the welding raw material & consumables market is highly competitive, with approximately 55-60% of the market being organized. The rest 40-45% of the market is unorganised and fragmented with small size players generally catering to last mile end users who do not require very high-quality products and mostly prefers low priced products. Such players usually do not go for third party approvals for quality control and assurances.

The expansion strategy reflects our Company proactive approach to scaling up operations to meet growing demand while maintaining efficient utilisation of its manufacturing capabilities. While we have an expanding portfolio of products, our competitors may have the advantage of focusing on concentrated products. Further, we compete against established players also, which may have greater access to financial, technical and marketing resources and expertise available to them than us in the products and services in which we compete against them. In order to counter the competition, our focus would be to provide products that would be in consonance with technical and quality requirements of our customer as well as by trying to offer a competitive pricing model without compromise on the quality.

We believe that we are able to compete effectively with them due to our product portfolio, marketing network, customized and quality processing services. We expect that our commitment to quality, and a past record of timely execution and transparency will provide us with an edge over our competitors. For further information on the competition, we face in the markets in which we operate, please see the chapter titled “*Industry Overview*” on page 152 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
