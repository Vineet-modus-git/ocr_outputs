some of these products which provide them better cost benefits as compared to us or source the products from our competitors. The price-pressure from our customers may adversely affect the prices of the products which we supply, which may lead to reduced revenues, lower profit margins or loss of market share etc., any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Additional risks that could significantly harm our customers as well as us, include:

a) action undertaken by the government to tax our business, or that of our customers

b) recession in countries in which our key customers operate their businesses

c) slowdown and reduced spending in the industries in which our customers operate

d) our customers' inability to effectively manage their operations

e) a change in their management which may result in us not being a preferred supplier to them

f) changes in laws affecting our customers to operate profitably

In relation to other end-use industries, the demand for our products and margin of our products is dependent on and directly affected by factors affecting such industries. Accordingly, our failure to effectively adapt to such end-use industry related disruptions, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, we must continually modify and improve our products in response to changes in our customers' requirements or end-user preferences.

**47. Our business is dependent on the performance of construction and infrastructure industry and other industrial sectors.**

As per CRISIL Report, the welding raw material & consumables industry is a critical component of the country's manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, playing a pivotal role in the nation's economic development. As India undergoes rapid industrialisation and urbanisation, the demand for products has surged, making it a key contributor to construction and infrastructure industry and other industrial sectors such as automotive, aerospace, energy and shipbuilding.

Any slowdown or lack of growth in these industrial sectors could have a material adverse impact on the demand and pricing of our products and services, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result of our dependence on end-customers in these other industries, we are exposed to fluctuations in the performance of these other industries globally, and in India. These other industries are sensitive to factors such as consumer demand, consumer confidence, disposable income levels and employment levels. Moreover, they are also affected by other factors such as national and international trade, changes in government policies, environmental, health and safety regulations and commodity prices. A decline in our customers' business performance may also lead to a corresponding decrease in demand for our products. Although there have been instances of variation in demand of our products (as provided in the table above) the same has not had a material adverse effect on the overall business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of our Company.

**48. If we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, including our ability to protect our brand through intellectual property, the sales of our products will suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.**

We believe that our brand plays a significant role in the success of our business and sustaining customer loyalty. The ability to differentiate our products from that of our competitors is an important factor in attracting customers. As of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has made two applications for trademarks which are currently used by us. For details, see "*Our Business – Intellectual Property*" on page 215. The laws governing intellectual property rights in India are evolving and enforcement mechanisms remain inconsistent which could involve substantial legal and operational risks to us. Failure to register new intellectual property rights or renew the registration of any of our registered intellectual properties may affect our right to use such intellectual properties in future or allow others to use our products and designs as available in the public domain, without our consent. This may lead to misappropriation of our goodwill or dilution of our brand value. If we are unable to register our trademarks or other intellectual property for any reason, including our inability to remove objections or resolve opposition proceedings, or if any of our unregistered marks are registered or used by a third party in India or other jurisdictions, we may not be able to enforce ownership rights and may be unable to seek remedies for infringement. Our trademark protection is currently limited to India. We may not be able to effectively protect or enforce our intellectual
