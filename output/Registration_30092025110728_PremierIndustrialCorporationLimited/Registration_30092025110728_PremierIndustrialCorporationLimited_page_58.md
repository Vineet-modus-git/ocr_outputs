these payments, our profit margins could be adversely affected. Our financial position and profitability therefore depend on the credit-worthiness of our customers. We may not be able to accurately assess the creditworthiness of all of our customers. They may also face limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or financial constraints triggered by macroeconomic conditions, which could cause them to delay payment, request modifications to their payment terms, or default on their payment obligations, all of which could increase our trade receivables and/or write-offs of trade receivables. Macroeconomic conditions, such as a potential credit crisis in the global financial system, could also result in financial difficulties for our customers, including limited access to the credit markets. Such conditions could cause our customers to delay payment, request modifications of their payment terms, or default on their payment obligations to us, all of which could increase our receivables. While we have not experienced any material credit losses, some of our customers may delay payments due to changes in internal payment procedures driven by rules and regulations to which they are subject or if, in their opinion, we have not met our contractual obligations. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our working capital estimations, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our products are offered at various price points and the pricing risk is suitably mitigated as majority of our sales are directly to our customers. Our sales and marketing team takes into consideration various factors such as consistency, landing costs and discounts, and applicable taxes to arrive at the list price of our offerings. Most of the production that we entail is carried by us after the receipt of the order at a pre agreed price and hence, as a result we are able to maintain the margins and work on a converter model and are largely immune to commodity price fluctuations. Our future earnings through the sale and distribution of our products may not be realized as forecasted, due to cancellations or modifications of firm orders or our failure to accurately prepare demand forecasts. If we are unable to appropriately estimate the demand for our products for any reason, it could result in excess inventory levels or the unavailability of our products during increased demand, resulting in loss in potential sales.

Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products is affected by various factors, including:

* a substantial increase or decrease in the demand for our products or for similar offerings of our competitors
* changes in customer requirements
* aggressive pricing strategies employed by our competitors
* failure to accurately forecast or changes in customer acceptance of our products
* limited historical demand and sales data for our products in newer markets fluctuations in foreign currencies
* weakening of general economic conditions or customer confidence that could reduce the sale of our products.

We maintain inventories of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods based on the existing and forecasted demand. However, if we are unable to accurately forecast such demand, we may accumulate excess inventory or face shortages. Excess inventory could lead to inventory write-downs or write-offs or require us to sell at discounted prices, adversely affecting our gross margins, financial performance, and brand positioning. Conversely, inadequate inventory during periods of increased demand may result in delayed deliveries, lost sales, and potential damage to customer relationships and reputation.

Our ability to accurately forecast demand is influenced by factors such as:

* significant shifts in customer preferences or demand,
* changes in customer specifications or ordering patterns,
* aggressive pricing strategies adopted by competitors,
* limited historical sales data in newer markets,
* general economic slowdown affecting customer purchasing power, and
* volatility in commodity or foreign exchange rates.

We usually keep about 107-167 days of inventory of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods at our facilities. Our number of inventory days with respect to any period is defined as the average inventory
