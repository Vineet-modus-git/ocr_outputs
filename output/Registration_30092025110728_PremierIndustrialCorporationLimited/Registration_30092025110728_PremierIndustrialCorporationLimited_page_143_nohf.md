## Qualitative Factors

Some of the qualitative factors which form the basis for computing the Offer Price are as follows:

### 1. Product portfolio tailored to customer requirements with the capability to expand SKUs.

We offer a product portfolio comprising powders (ferro alloys, metals, minerals and chemicals) and wires (low & non alloy steel wires, nickel-based alloy wires and stainless-steel wires), which are tailored to meet customer-specific requirements. While our powders are manufactured on a made-to-order basis, designed in line with customer specifications and application requirements, our wires include both standardised variants as well as customised offerings, enabling us to address a wider range of industrial applications.

As of March 31, 2025, our product portfolio includes more than 410 SKUs, comprising powders and wires. With over four decades of experience in the welding consumables industry, we have developed a strong understanding of customer and industry practices, which has enabled us to adapt and expand our portfolio in line with evolving requirements. Over the years, we have consistently added new SKUs to our range, with 73 new SKUs introduced in Fiscal 2025, 45 new SKUs in Fiscal 2024 and 34 new SKUs in Fiscal 2023, reflecting our capability to develop application-specific products and respond quickly to customer needs.

### 2. Strategic network of manufacturing facilities with advanced capabilities

The aggregate installed capacity of our manufacturing facilities as of March 31, 2025 was 23,703 MTPA for powder products and 4,194 MTPA for wire products. As of March 31, 2025, we operate five manufacturing facilities with four of them located in Maharashtra (at Mankholi, Taloja, Wada, Rabale) and one in Tamil Nadu (at Chennai). We manufacture powder products at our Mankholi, Taloja, Chennai, and Wada units, and wire products at our Rabale unit which are used as raw materials by the welding consumable industry. Our Chennai, Taloja, and Rabale units are located on land leased from state industrial corporations, while the Mankholi and Wada units are situated on freehold land owned by us.

In Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, our additions to our cost of plant and equipment were ₹27.44 million, ₹17.27 million and ₹13.73 million respectively constituting 38.95%, 49.02% and 35.29% respectively of our total capital expenditure for the respective Fiscal.

### 3. Long standing relationships with customers and suppliers with track record of repeat orders

Over the years, we have established long-standing relationship with several Indian and global customers and suppliers. We have a significant presence in the country's welding consumables industry, catering to the needs of leading welding electrode manufacturers (Source: CRISIL Report). According to the CRISIL Report, during Fiscal 2025 we contributed ~8% (~4.9 KTPA) of the overall demand for metal and ferro alloy powders generated in the domestic welding consumables industry.

We believe that the strength of our customer relationships is attributable to our ability to customize to our customers' specifications and requirements, as well as our track record of consistent delivery of quality and cost-effective products over the years. As a result of our deep-rooted association with our customers, our Company often receives new product requirements from our customers which in turn, helps us to expand our product base. We have been able to retain majority of our existing customers as well as acquire new customers to expand the customer base and diversity. Our key differentiators include: (i) our ability to ensure
