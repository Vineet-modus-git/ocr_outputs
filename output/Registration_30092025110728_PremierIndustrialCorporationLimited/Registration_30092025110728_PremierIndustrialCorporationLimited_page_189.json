However, prices rebounded during December 2023-February 2024, driven by supply constraints. The average price for H2FY24 was Rs 79,837 per tonne, marking an 11% decline, in line with global price trends.

During H1FY24, chrome alloy prices declined sequentially due to weak export demand and lower input costs, particularly coking coal. However, prices began to rise from May 2023 to September 2023, driven by improvements in Chinese chrome alloy prices and increased export demand."}, {"bbox": [195, 1502, 1456, 1728], "category": "Text", "text": "In H2FY24, ferrochrome prices followed a downward trajectory during October-November 2023, primarily due to weak Chinese market prices and reduced demand in the Indian stainless steel sector. Nevertheless, prices started to increase again during December 2023-February 2024, driven by rising chrome ore costs and healthy demand for stainless steel, amidst limited supply due to production cuts by some players. The average cost for H2FY24 stood at Rs 104,829 per tonne, representing a 1.3% year-over-year increase. The rise in prices was partially mitigated by the decline in power and coking coal costs. Overall, the ferrochrome market demonstrated resilience, driven by the interplay of global demand, supply dynamics, and input costs."}, {"bbox": [195, 1756, 449, 1792], "category": "Section-header", "text": "Impact of US Tariffs"}, {"bbox": [195, 1821, 1456, 2081], "category": "Text", "text": "The U.S. Commerce Department on Sept 24th announced that it has opened a new national security investigations into the import of personal protective equipment, medical items, robotics and industrial machinery. The robotics probe includes machine tools for cutting, welding, and handling workpieces, autoclaves and industrial ovens. Laser and water-cutting tools and machinery are also included. When tariffs are imposed on imported metals such as steel and aluminum—two key materials used in welding—the immediate effect is a rise in material prices. In addition to raising material costs, tariffs can disrupt global supply chains. Many welding companies operate in a tightly connected international network, sourcing materials or components from abroad while exporting finished goods. While currently tariffs are not directly affecting consumables it is a key monitorable."}]
