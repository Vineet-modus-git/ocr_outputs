## Overview of shielding gases

Shielding gases are used in various welding processes to protect the weld pool from atmospheric contamination, which can cause defects such as porosity, oxidation and weld bead irregularities. The choice of shielding gas can significantly affect the weld's quality, appearance and mechanical properties.

The types of shielding gas used in the welding industry are:

<table><thead><tr><td>Type and share (%)</td><td>Applications</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Argon (40-50%)</td><td><ul><li>Metal inert gas (MIG) welding</li><li>Tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding</li><li>Aluminium, stainless steel and non-ferrous metals</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) (30-40%)</td><td><ul><li>MIG welding (especially for steel and low-alloy steels)</li><li>Heavy equipment and structural steel welding</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Argon-CO<sub>2</sub> mixtures (10-15%)</td><td><ul><li>MIG welding of steel, stainless steel and aluminium</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Argon-oxygen mixtures*</td><td><ul><li>MIG welding of stainless steel</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Helium (5-10%)</td><td><ul><li>TIG welding of aluminium, stainless steel and high-strength alloys</li><li>MIG welding for higher deposition rates</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Hydrogen*</td><td><ul><li>MIG welding of high-strength low-alloy steels and stainless steels</li><li>GTAW of reactive metals</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Nitrogen*</td><td><ul><li>Stainless steel welding, particularly in some controlled environments</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

Note: Other gases, including argon-oxygen mixtures, hydrogen and nitrogen account for ~5-10%

Shielding gases account for less than 5% share (<25 KTPA) in the welding consumables market. The usage of shielding gases in the welding process is relatively new, compared with traditional welding consumables such as electrodes and wires. However, the role of shielding gases cannot be downplayed. The choice of shielding gas can have a significant impact on the overall cost of a welding operation, extending beyond just protecting the weld. It can influence labour costs as the amount of spatter generated impacts the time spent on post-weld cleaning. Furthermore, the shielding gas used can impact the efficiency of the filler metal, with optimal gas selection enabling welders to achieve the desired weld width and depth while minimising the risk of burn-through. Additionally, the right shielding gas can also play a crucial role in maintaining weld aesthetics, particularly when working with sensitive material, such as stainless steel, by preventing discolouration.
