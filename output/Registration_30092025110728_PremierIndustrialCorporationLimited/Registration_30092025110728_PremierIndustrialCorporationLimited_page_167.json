States are encouraged to follow suit and can seek support from the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IPDF).\n3. **Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM):** The JJM initiative will be extended until 2028 to ensure 100% coverage of clean drinking water across the country. It will receive a significantly enhanced outlay to accelerate its implementation.\n4. **UDAN Scheme:** Building on the success of the UDAN scheme, which has connected 88 airports and launched 619 operational routes, the government will introduce an upgraded version. This will add 120 new destinations and serve 40 million passengers over the next decade.\n5. **Infrastructure Development in Bihar:** The government plans to develop greenfield airports and provide financial support for the Western Koshi Canal ERM Projects to address Bihar's future infrastructure needs.\n6. **Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs):** Following the Interim Budget 2024, India signed BITs with two countries to boost foreign investment. To further these efforts, the government will revamp the BIT framework, making it more investor-friendly to align with the 'First Develop India' vision.\n7. **Asset Monetization Plan 2025-30:** Building on the success of the 2021 Asset Monetization Plan, the government will launch a new INR 10 Lakh Crore asset monetization plan for 2025-30.

This funding will support a wide range of initiatives, including highways, metro systems, airports, and water supply infrastructure. By providing states with greater financial flexibility, the government is decentralizing infrastructure development, ensuring that growth reaches not just metro cities but also emerging industrial and urban centers.\n* The development of a 3-year pipeline of PPP projects will encourage private sector participation in large-scale infrastructure initiatives, making these projects more viable by leveraging both public and private sector resources. Additionally, the government's INR 10 Lakh Crore Asset Monetization Plan for 2025-30 will unlock funds from existing infrastructure assets, enabling the construction of new expressways, smart logistics zones, and urban transit corridors.\n* The Jal Jeevan Mission's extension until 2028, with an increased outlay of INR 67,000 Crore, will significantly drive construction activity, particularly in water supply projects across rural and urban areas, contributing to a large-scale uplift in infrastructure.\n* The revamped UDAN scheme will enhance regional air connectivity, prompting the construction of new airport terminals and aviation infrastructure. This, in turn, will stimulate real estate development and commercial activity around airport zones.
