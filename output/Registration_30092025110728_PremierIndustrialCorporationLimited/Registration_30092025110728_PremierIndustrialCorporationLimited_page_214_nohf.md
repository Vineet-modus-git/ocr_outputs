1. Raw Material Availability
The process begins with checking the availability of raw materials. If not available in stock, procurement is initiated.
2. Raw Material Inspection
All procured raw materials are inspected for chemical composition and quality parameters. Based on results, materials are either approved, recycled, remelted, or rejected.
3. Melting (if required)
Where necessary, raw materials are melted in furnaces to achieve the required form before further processing.
4. Testing of Material
Melted or processed raw material undergoes quality testing to ensure it meets specifications. Materials are again approved, recycled, remelted, or rejected based on results.
5. Crushing
Approved material is subjected to crushing operations to reduce it into smaller, manageable sizes.
6. Grinding
The crushed material is further ground to finer sizes to prepare it for subsequent steps.
7. Sieving
The ground material is passed through sieves to classify and separate it according to the required size specifications.
8. Agglomeration and Blending
Where required, the material is agglomerated and blended with flux or additives to achieve uniformity.
9. Atomization (if required)
In specific cases, the material undergoes atomization to produce fine powder with controlled characteristics.
10. Testing and Quality Control
The processed material is tested for physical, chemical, and structural properties. Based on test results, it is either approved, recycled, remelted, or rejected.
11. Packaging and Labelling
Approved material is packaged and labelled in accordance with customer and regulatory requirements.
12. Final Inspection and Dispatch
All packaged material undergoes a final inspection before dispatch to ensure quality compliance.
13. Customer Feedback
Post-dispatch, customer feedback is collected to enhance quality and improve future processes.
