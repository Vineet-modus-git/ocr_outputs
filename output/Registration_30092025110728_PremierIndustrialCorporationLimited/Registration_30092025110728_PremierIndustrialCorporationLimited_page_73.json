India's sovereign rating decreased from Baa2 with a negative outlook to Baa3 with a stable outlook by Moody's in October 2021 which was reaffirmed in August 2023 and from BBB with a stable outlook to BBB- with a stable outlook by Fitch in June 2022 which was reaffirmed in January 2024.

A downgrading of the credit ratings of India may occur, for example, upon a change of government tax or fiscal policy, which are outside of our control.
