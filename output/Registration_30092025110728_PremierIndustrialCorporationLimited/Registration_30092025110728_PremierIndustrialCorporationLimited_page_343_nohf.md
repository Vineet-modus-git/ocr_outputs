### Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments

The Company does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

### Foreign currency exposure

The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations will arise.

### Commodity risk

The Company's activities are exposed to raw material price risks and therefore its overall risk management program focuses on the volatile nature of the raw material market, thus seeking to minimize potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance on account of such volatility. The risk management committee regularly reviews and monitors risk management principles, policies, and risk management activities.
