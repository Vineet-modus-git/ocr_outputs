m) CASH FLOW STATEMENT:

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.

n) GOVERNMENT GRANTS

The Company 12ecognized government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is 12ecognized as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed off. When the grant relates to an asset, the Company deducts such grant amount from the carrying amount of the asset.

o) EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS:

Exceptional items refer to items of income or expense, including tax items, within the statement of profit and loss from ordinary activities which are non-recurring and are of such size, nature or incidence that their separate disclosure is considered necessary to explain the performance of the Company.

p) SEGMENT REPORTING

As per Ind AS 108 – Operating Segments, the Chief Operating Decision Maker i.e Board of Directors evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates the resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Inter segment sales and transfers are reflected at market prices. Segment revenue, segment expenses, segment assets and segment liabilities have been identified to segments based on their relationship to the operating activities of the segment. The analysis of geographical segments is based on the areas in which the Company’s products are sold. Inter segment revenue is accounted based on transactions which are primarily determined based on market / fair value factors. Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities which relate to the Company as a whole and are not allocable to segments on a reasonable basis have been included under “unallocated revenue / expenses / assets / liabilities”.

q) INCOME TAX

Tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Restated Statement of Profit or Loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to realise the asset or to settle the liability on a net basis.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
