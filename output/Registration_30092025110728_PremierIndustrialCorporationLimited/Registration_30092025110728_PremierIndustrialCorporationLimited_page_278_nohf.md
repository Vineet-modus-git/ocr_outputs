## 2.4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

### a) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE)

An item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle is applied to the costs incurred initially to acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

The cost of PPE includes interest on borrowings directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be made ready for its intended use or sale. Borrowing costs and other directly attributable cost are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use, which generally coincides with the commissioning date of those assets.

The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision is met. Machinery spares that meet the definition of PPE are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the principal item of an asset.

All other repair and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, are recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. When a replacement occurs, the carrying value of the replaced part is de-recognised. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, these components are accounted for as separate items.

PPE acquired and put to use for projects are capitalised and depreciation thereon is included in the project cost till the project is ready for commissioning.

**Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value**

Depreciation on PPE (except leasehold improvements and PPE acquired under finance lease) is calculated using the Written Down Value Method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. However, leasehold improvements and PPE acquired under finance lease are depreciated on a straight-line method over the shorter of their respective useful lives or the tenure of the lease arrangement. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Schedule II to the Companies Act 2013 prescribes useful lives for various classes of assets. For certain class of assets, based on technical evaluation and assessment, Management believes that the useful lives adopted by it reflect the periods over which these assets are expected to be used. Accordingly for those assets, the useful lives estimated by the management are different from those prescribed in the Schedule. Management's estimates of the useful lives for various classes of fixed assets are as given below:

<table><thead><tr><td>ASSET</td><td>USEFUL LIFE</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Factory Building</td><td>30 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Plant & Equipment</td><td>15 to 30 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture & Fixtures</td><td>10 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Office Equipment</td><td>5 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>8 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical fittings</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>3 years</td></tr></tbody></table>
