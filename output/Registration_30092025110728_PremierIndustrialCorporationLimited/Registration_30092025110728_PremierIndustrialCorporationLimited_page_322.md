Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, these components are accounted for as separate items.

PPE acquired and put to use for projects are capitalised and depreciation thereon is included in the project cost till the project is ready for commissioning.

### Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value

Depreciation on PPE (except leasehold improvements and PPE acquired under finance lease) is calculated using the Written Down Value Method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. However, leasehold improvements and PPE acquired under finance lease are depreciated on a straight-line method over the shorter of their respective useful lives or the tenure of the lease arrangement. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Schedule II to the Companies Act 2013 prescribes useful lives for various class of assets. For certain class of assets, based on technical evaluation and assessment, Management believes that the useful lives adopted by it reflect the periods over which these assets are expected to be used. Accordingly for those assets, the useful lives estimated by the management are different from those prescribed in the Schedule. Management's estimates of the useful lives for various classes of fixed assets are as given below:

<table><thead><tr><td>ASSET</td><td>USEFUL LIFE</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Factory Building</td><td>30 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Plant & Equipment</td><td>15 to 30 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture & Fixtures</td><td>10 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Office Equipment</td><td>5 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>8 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical fittings</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>3 years</td></tr></tbody></table>

Useful lives and residual values of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. Losses arising from the retirement of, and gains or losses arising from disposal/adjustments of PPE are recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss.

### b) INTANGIBLE ASSET

Intangible Assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Profit or Loss on disposal of intangible assets is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

### c) CAPITAL WORK IN PROGRESS & CAPITAL ADVANCES:

Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of assets that are yet not ready for their intended use at the balance sheet date. Advances given towards acquisition of fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are classified as Capital Advances under Other Non-Current Assets.

### d) INVESTMENT PROPERTY

Investment properties are land and buildings that are held for long term lease rental yields and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties are initially recognised at cost including transaction costs. Subsequently investment properties comprising buildings are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation on buildings is provided over the estimated useful lives as specified in above note for property plant and equipment above. The residual values estimated useful lives and depreciation method of investment properties are reviewed, and adjusted on prospective basis as appropriate, at each reporting date. The effects of any revision are included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the changes arise.

An investment property is de-recognised when either the investment property has been disposed of or do not meet the criteria of investment property i.e. when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
