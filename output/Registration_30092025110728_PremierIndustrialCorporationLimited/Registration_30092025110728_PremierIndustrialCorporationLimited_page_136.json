The nature of our products, used for further manufacturing, and a customer base that supplies to both government and private entities, often results in longer payment cycles. The slight decrease in receivable days from 81 to 80 days in FY 2024 was due to decline in Revenue from Operations (₹311.57 million) compared to the decline in Trade Receivables (₹88.80 million). Although the debtor balance decreased, the larger reduction in the sales base over which the days are calculated resulted in the extension of the receivable period. Conversely, the sharp decrease to 67 days in FY2025 was driven by a 40.33% surge in Revenue from Operations (increase of ₹1,369.01 million), which significantly outpaced the 51.39% increase in Trade Receivables (increase of ₹357.84 million). The substantial increase in revenue, which is the denominator in the days calculation, led to a compression of the Trade Receivable Days, even with the growth in outstanding debtors. For FY 2026, FY 2027, and FY 2028, we project a reduction in trade receivable days to 75, 74, and 73 days, respectively. This is a strategic move to secure new customers with more stringent payment terms, thereby lessening our dependence on repeated customers. We anticipate our trade receivable days will stabilize and will be in line with industry standards.</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory days</td><td>Our inventory holding period has fluctuated from 79 to 120 days over the last three financial years. As a manufacturer of powder and wires used as a raw material in the welding consumables industry, maintaining a certain level of inventory is crucial. The increase to 117 days in FY 2024 was due to a significant 10% drop in raw material prices. The further increase to 120 days in FY 2025 was a result of revenue growth. For FY 2026, we project a further increase to 129 days as a strategic measure to mitigate price volatility in the metal market. For FY 2027 and FY 2028, we expect inventory days to decrease to 128 and 125 days, respectively, as we anticipate stabilization in raw material prices. Maintaining a 120-day inventory level is crucial for ensuring smooth order execution, timely delivery, and managing raw material price risks. This level also helps improve supply chain reliability and provides the flexibility needed to meet the demand from various sectors like construction and infrastructure, automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding and marine, energy, manufacturing, defence and military, mining and mineral processing, art and design, electronics and electrical, where customization is often required. The nature of our finished products, supplied to various sectors, necessitates customization in the process. Therefore, keeping an adequate inventory is crucial to ensure smooth order execution and timely delivery</td></tr><tr><td>Other Financial Assets and Current Assets days</td><td>These assets, which include balances for GST input credit and advances to suppliers, are expected to grow in line with the overall business expansion. The decrease in this category from ₹165 million in FY 2023 to ₹132 million in FY 2024 was primarily due to a ₹79.5 million GST refund claim. The subsequent increase to ₹160 million in FY 2025 was driven by an advance payment of ₹21.69 million for customs duty. As our operations scale, we</td></tr></table>"}]
