**Liquidity risk:**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to Company's reputation.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Company's debt financing plans, covenant compliance and compliance with internal statement of financial position ratio targets.

**(i) Maturities of financial liabilities:**

The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date:

**Market risk:**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices – will affect the Company's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of certain commodities. Thus, its exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure in revenues and costs.

**Interest Rate Risk**

Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk of changes in fair values of fixed and floating interest-bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of fixed and floating interest-bearing investments will fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Company's profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:
