The usage of shielding gases in the welding process is relatively new, compared with traditional welding consumables such as electrodes and wires. However, the role of shielding gases cannot be downplayed. The choice of shielding gas can have a significant impact on the overall cost of a welding operation, extending beyond just protecting the weld. It can influence labour costs as the amount of spatter generated impacts the time spent on post-weld cleaning. Furthermore, the shielding gas used can impact the efficiency of the filler metal, with optimal gas selection enabling welders to achieve the desired weld width and depth while minimising the risk of burn-through. Additionally, the right shielding gas can also play a crucial role in maintaining weld aesthetics, particularly when working with sensitive material, such as stainless steel, by preventing discolouration."}, {"bbox": [196, 1382, 858, 1415], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Company profile: Premier Industrial Corporation Ltd."}, {"bbox": [196, 1446, 1454, 1573], "category": "Text", "text": "PICL has been incorporated in the year 2007 pursuant to conversion of partnership firm M/s.
