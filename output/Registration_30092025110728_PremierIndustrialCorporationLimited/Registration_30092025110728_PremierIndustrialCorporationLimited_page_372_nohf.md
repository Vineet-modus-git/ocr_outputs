The Bidder shall be compensated in the manner specified in the SEBI ICDR Master Circular, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the deemed agreement of our Company with the SCSBs, to the extent applicable.

The above timetable, other than the Bid/Offer Closing Date, is indicative and does not constitute any obligation or liability on our Company, the Selling Shareholders or the BRLM.

While our Company shall ensure that all steps for the completion of the necessary formalities for the listing and commencement of trading of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges are taken within three Working Days from the Bid/Offer Closing Date, as may be prescribed by the SEBI, the timetable may be extended due to various factors, such as extension of the Bid/Offer Period by our Company, in consultation with the BRLM, revision of the Price Band or any delay in receiving the final listing and trading approval from the Stock Exchanges. The commencement of trading of the Equity Shares will be entirely at the discretion of the Stock Exchanges and in accordance with the applicable laws. The Selling Shareholders confirm that they shall extend reasonable support and co-operation in relation to the Offered Shares, as may be requested by our Company and the BRLM for the completion of the necessary formalities for listing and commencement of trading of the Equity Shares at the Stock Exchanges within three Working Days from the Bid/Offer Closing Date, as may be prescribed by the SEBI.

In terms of the UPI Circulars, in relation to the Offer, the BRLM will be required to submit reports of compliance with listing timelines and activities prescribed by the SEBI, in connection with the allotment and listing procedure within three Working Days from the Bid / Offer Closing Date or such other time as prescribed by SEBI, identifying non-adherence to timelines and processes and an analysis of entities responsible for the delay and the reasons associated with it.
