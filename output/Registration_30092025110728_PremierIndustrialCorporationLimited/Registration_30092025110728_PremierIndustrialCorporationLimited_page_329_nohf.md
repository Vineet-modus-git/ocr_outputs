## r) PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

A present obligation that arises from past events, where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Claims against the Company, where the possibility of any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised.

## s) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Derivatives are recognized initially at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in profit or loss.

Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in fair value of derivatives and hedged items attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives is recognized in other comprehensive income, the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss immediately.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if the hedge no longer meets the criteria.

The Company discloses derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value, with classification as current or non-current based on the timing of expected cash flows.
