Useful lives and residual values of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. Losses arising from the retirement of, and gains or losses arising from disposal/adjustments of PPE are recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss.

b) INTANGIBLE ASSET

Intangible Assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if
any. Profit or Loss on disposal of intangible assets is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

c) CAPITAL WORK IN PROGRESS & CAPITAL ADVANCES:

Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of assets that are yet not ready for their intended use at the balance sheet date. Advances given towards acquisition of fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are classified as Capital Advances under Other Non-Current Assets.

d) INVESTMENT PROPERTY

Investment properties are land and buildings that are held for long term lease rental yields and/ or for capital appreciation. Investment properties are initially recognised at cost including transaction costs. Subsequently investment properties comprising buildings are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Depreciation on buildings is provided over the estimated useful lives as specified in above note for property plant and equipment above. The residual values estimated useful lives and depreciation method of investment properties are reviewed, and adjusted on prospective basis as appropriate, at each reporting date. The effects of any revision are included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the changes arise.

An investment property is de-recognised when either the investment property has been disposed of or do not meet the criteria of investment property i.e. when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period of de- recognition.

e) IMPAIRMENT OF PPE, CWIP AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The carrying values of assets / cash generating units('CGU') at each Balance Sheet date are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication of such impairment exists, the recoverable amount of such assets / CGU is estimated and in case the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor. Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether there is indication that an impairment loss recognized for an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have decreased, consequent to which such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss.

f) NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Non-current assets (including disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.
