## Metals, Ferro alloys, Minerals and Chemicals based Powders

The Metals, Ferro alloys, Minerals and Chemicals Powder are used either directly in welding or form a part of the flux powder used in the welding consumables industry.

This segment includes manufacturing of metal, ferro alloy, mineral and chemical powders as per customer requirements. The metal and ferro alloy Powder are used either directly in welding or form a part of the flux powder used in the welding consumables industry. Some of the major category of metal, ferro alloy, mineral and chemical powders which are additives to flux coatings/fillers along their respective properties are as below:

<table><thead><tr><th>Powder type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Metal Powder</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Nickel</td><td>Used to enhance corrosion resistance and improve the toughness of welding alloys in high-performance applications</td></tr><tr><td>Chromium</td><td>Serves as an alloying agent to increase hardness and oxidation resistance in stainless steel welds</td></tr><tr><td>Manganese</td><td>Effective deoxidizers and de sulphurizer of weld pool, imparts strength & adds toughness to the weld</td></tr><tr><td>Tungsten</td><td>Utilized in producing tungsten electrodes for TIG welding, providing high-temperature stability and a clean arc</td></tr><tr><td>Iron</td><td>Commonly used in flux-cored wires to improve weld metal properties, reduce porosity and improves deposition efficiency of welding consumables</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Ferro alloy Powder</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Medium carbon ferro manganese</td><td>Enhances the strength and wear resistance of steel welds while deoxidizing the weld pool, it provides the same action as manganese but at a lower cost</td></tr><tr><td>Medium carbon ferro chrome</td><td>At a lower concentration level, it Improves hardness and strengthens the weld metal whereas at a high concentration level, it improves corrosion resistance in weld metals</td></tr><tr><td>Ferro silicon</td><td>Plays several crucial roles in welding electrodes, including deoxidization, alloying, controlled cooling, fluxing, and arc stability, all of which contribute to the quality and performance of the welded joints. It improves the fluidity of weld metals and ensures refurbishment of weld microstructure</td></tr><tr><td>Ferro silicon manganese</td><td>Helps in improving toughness and reducing carbon content in steel welds, gives a combined type of effect of manganese and silicon but at a lower cost</td></tr><tr><td>Ferro tungsten</td><td>Used to produce high-performance welding electrodes to improve their performance in terms of arc stability, heat and corrosion resistance. Because of its high melting point, ferrotungsten is a robust alloy with applications in aerospace and making of tungsten-containing steel</td></tr></tbody></table>
