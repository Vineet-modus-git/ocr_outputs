The fund requirements, the deployment of funds and the intended use of the Net Proceeds, for the Proposed Expansion at the Wada Unit, as described hereinabove, are based on our current business plan, management estimates, current and valid quotations from suppliers, and other commercial and technical factors. However, such total estimated cost and related fund requirements have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution. We may have to revise our funding requirements and deployment on account of a variety of factors such as our financial and market condition, business and strategy, competition and interest or exchange rate fluctuations and other external factors, which may not be within the control of our management. This may entail rescheduling or revising the planned expenditure and funding requirements, including the expenditure for a particular purpose at the discretion of our management.

## Means of finance

We intend to fund the entire cost of the Proposed Expansion from the Net Proceeds and internal accruals. Accordingly, we confirm that there are no requirements to make firm arrangements of finance under Regulation 7(1)(e) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations through verifiable means towards at least 75% of the stated means of finance, excluding the amount to be raised from the Fresh Issue.

In case of a shortfall in the Net Proceeds or any increase in the actual utilization of funds earmarked for the objects, our Company shall bear such costs out of internal accruals. Our Company may also consider raising bridge financing facilities, including through secured or unsecured loans or any short-term instrument like non-convertible debentures, commercial papers or inter-corporate deposits, pending receipt of the Net Proceeds.
