## Certain Information for Bidders

The relevant Designated Intermediary will enter a maximum of three Bids at different price levels opted in the Bid cum Application Form and such options are not considered as multiple Bids. It is the Bidder's responsibility to obtain the Acknowledgement Slip from the relevant Designated Intermediary. The registration of the Bid by the Designated Intermediary does not guarantee that the Equity Shares shall be allocated/Allotted. Such Acknowledgement Slip will be non-negotiable and by itself will not create any obligation of any kind. When a Bidder revises his or her Bid, he /she shall surrender the earlier Acknowledgement Slip and may request for a revised Acknowledgement Slip from the relevant Designated Intermediary as proof of his or her having revised the previous Bid.

In relation to electronic registration of Bids, the permission given by the Stock Exchanges to use their network and software of the electronic bidding system should not in any way be deemed or construed to mean that the compliance with various statutory and other requirements by our Company, the Selling Shareholders and/or the BRLM are cleared or approved by the Stock Exchanges, nor does it in any manner warrant, certify or endorse the correctness or completeness of compliance with the statutory and other requirements, nor does it take any responsibility for the financial or other soundness of our Company, the management or any scheme or project of our Company, nor does it in any manner warrant, certify or endorse the correctness or completeness of any of the contents of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, nor does it warrant that the Equity Shares will be listed or will continue to be listed on the Stock Exchanges.
