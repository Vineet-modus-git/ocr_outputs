carrying amount of the asset is recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period of de-recognition.

### e) IMPAIRMENT OF PPE, CWIP AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The carrying values of assets / cash generating units ('CGU') at each Balance Sheet date are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication of such impairment exists, the recoverable amount of such assets / CGU is estimated and in case the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor. Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether there is indication that an impairment loss recognized as an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have decreased, consequent to which such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss.

### f) NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Non-current assets (including disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised from the date when they are classified as held for sale.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet.

A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed off or is classified as held for sale and:

* represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and ;

* is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations.

The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

### g) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

#### i. Financial Assets:

##### Recognition and measurement:

###### Initial recognition and measurement:

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit and loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company's business model for managing them.

###### Subsequent measurement:

* Financial assets carried at amortized cost: A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
