## China

China's GDP grew at 8.7% in 2021, driven by pent-up demand and strong exports. Despite a property market-driven downturn, growth is expected to slow gradually to 4.6% in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026, supported by better-than-expected net exports. Recent policy measures may provide upside risk to near-term growth.

## India

After a 5.8% contraction in 2020, the country's GDP rebounded, growing at 9.7%, 7.0%, 9.2% and 6.5% in 2021, 2022, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Growth is expected to moderate to 6.5% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025, as pent-up demand is exhausted, and the economy returns to its potential.

## Middle East and Central Asia

The Middle Eastern and Central Asian economy contracted 2.2% in 2020, then rebounded to grow at 4.4% and 5.5% in 2021 and 2022. Growth slowed to 2.2% in 2023 but is projected to pick up to 3.0% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026 as oil production and shipping disruptions fade. The 2024 projection was revised down to 2.4% owing to Saudi Arabia's oil production cuts and the ongoing conflict in Sudan.

## Sub-Saharan Africa

Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP contracted 1.5% in 2020, then grew at 4.7% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022. Growth slowed to 3.6% in 2023 and 4.0% in 2024 because of weather disruptions and supply constraints. However, growth is projected to increase to 3.8% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026 as weather shocks abate and supply constraints ease.

## Latin America and the Caribbean

The Latin America and the Caribbean region are projected to grow at 2.0% in 2025, slower than 2.4% in 2024, before rebounding to 2.4% in 2026. Brazil's growth has been revised upwards to 2.0% in 2025, driven by strong private consumption and investment, and is expected to continue to grow at 2.0% in 2026 owing to a restrictive monetary policy and cooling labour market.

The GDP growth data reveals distinct patterns across major economies. India emerges as the standout performer, maintaining robust growth projections of 6.5% through 2030P despite the pandemic-related contraction of -5.8% in 2020. China's growth is strong but is projected to decelerate from 8.4% in 2021 to 3.3% by 2030P, reflecting its economic maturation. The advanced economies display more modest growth trajectories. The US is projected to maintain a relatively stable growth between 2.1% throughout the forecast period, while Japan's growth remains tepid, not seen exceeding 1.1% after 2025P. European economies, particularly Germany, show concerning weakness with near-stagnant growth projections (0.0-0.7% from 2025P-2030P). The divergence between emerging and developed economies is particularly striking in the recovery patterns. While emerging markets like India and China demonstrate a resilient growth momentum, developed nations show a clear trend toward lower growth rates in the latter half of the forecast period. This pattern suggests an accelerating shift in global economic gravity toward emerging markets, with India positioned to be a primary driver of global growth.

## Inflation overview

Global consumer price inflation, after ranging 3-5% between 2019 and 2021, jumped to 8.6% in 2022 because of sharp increase in prices of oil, natural gas, fertilisers and other commodities in the wake of geopolitical conflicts early on in the year. Supply chain disruption exacerbated the situation. However, in CY 2023, global inflation slowed to 6.6% because of the resolution of supply-side issues in a few industries.

## Five-year historical data and growth forecast

The IMF projects global inflation to decelerate to 5.7% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025, driven by demand stabilization and a reduction in price-related pressures. The anticipated slowdown in inflation is attributed to a broad-based decline in global core inflation, influenced by the anticipation of tight monetary policies, a relative softening in labor markets, and a fading pass-through effect from previous price declines. In advanced economies, disinflation has come at a relatively low cost to employment, thanks to offsetting supply developments, including a faster-than-expected decline in energy prices and a surprising rebound in labor supply, bolstered by substantial
