would issue a public notice in the newspapers in which the pre-Offer advertisements were published, within two
days of the Bid/ Offer Closing Date or such other time as may be prescribed by SEBI, providing reasons for not
proceeding with the Offer. The BRLM, through the Registrar to the Offer, shall notify the SCSBs and the Sponsor
Bank(s) to unblock the bank accounts of the ASBA Bidders within one Working Day from the date of receipt of
such notification and also inform the Bankers to the Offer to process refunds to the Anchor Investors, as the case
may be. Our Company shall also inform the same to the Stock Exchanges on which the Equity Shares are proposed
to be listed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Offer is also subject to obtaining (i) the final listing and trading approvals of
the Stock Exchanges, which our Company shall apply for after Allotment; and (ii) the final RoC approval of the
Prospectus after it is filed with the RoC. If our Company, in consultation with the BRLM, withdraws the Offer
after the Bid/Offer Closing Date and thereafter determines that it will proceed with a public offering of Equity
Shares, our Company shall file a fresh draft red herring prospectus with the SEBI and the Stock Exchanges.
