## Overview of welding fluxes/SAW fluxes

Welding fluxes are materials used to protect the weld pool from atmospheric contamination, assist in the formation of a stable arc, and help clean the base material during the welding process. They are crucial for achieving high-quality welds, particularly in processes like SAW, FCAW and certain types of brazing.

Fluxes are made from a combination of metal Powder and minerals.
