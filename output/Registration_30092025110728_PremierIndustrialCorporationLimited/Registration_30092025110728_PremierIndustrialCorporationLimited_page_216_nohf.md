7. Copper Coating and Cutting

Based on customer specifications certain wires are coated for welding applications. Wires are cut to specific lengths, as per order requirements.

8. Quality Control and Testing

All wires undergo quality checks, including tensile strength, hardness, microstructure, and chemical composition analysis. Based on test outcomes, materials are either approved, recycled, remelted, or rejected.

9. Finishing and Packaging

Before shipment, packaged products undergo a final inspection to confirm integrity and compliance. Approved products are then dispatched to customers.

10. Dispatch and Customer Feedback

Post final inspection, products are dispatched to customers. We actively monitor customer feedback to drive continuous improvement in quality and service delivery.

Procurement of Raw Materials

Our primary raw materials include ferro alloys, metal like nickel plates, nickel metal, stainless steel wire, ferro chrome low carbon, ferro molybdenum, ferro titanium, ferro tungsten, ferro niobium, iron powder, high carbon ferro chrome, ferro manganese carbon, ferro silicon lumps, ferro niobium powder, iron powder. We procure raw materials from our suppliers based on purchase orders and we do not have any long-term agreements with our suppliers. We reserve the right to reject defective materials. We source raw materials from both domestic and international suppliers. We generally do not enter into long-term supply contracts and instead establish short-term purchase agreements with most suppliers, with staggered deliveries.

We source raw materials from our suppliers based on quality specifications and cost effectiveness. We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on orders received and our forecasts of customer demand, which may be unpredictable and can fluctuate over time.

Inventory Management

Our inventory is determined based on a combination of confirmed and expected orders based on past trends. We manage our inventory based on various parameters for maintaining minimum and maximum stock levels of raw materials and finished products. Further, stock is taken physically at defined intervals and our existing stock is reviewed at regular intervals for quality purposes. Our finished products are stored on-site at our manufacturing Units.
