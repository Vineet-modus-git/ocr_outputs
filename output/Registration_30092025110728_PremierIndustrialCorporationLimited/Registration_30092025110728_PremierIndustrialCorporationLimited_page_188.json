As a result, the cost of Hot Rolled Coil (HRC), a benchmark steel product, decreased to approximately Rs 36,000 per tonne, down from Rs 38,000 per tonne as of September last year."}, {"bbox": [194, 1113, 1458, 1279], "category": "Text", "text": "In fiscal 2025, the flat steel sector witnessed a correction in prices, driven by cheaper imports and a competitive global market. Prices declined by 10% year-over-year, with the average price of flat steel standing at Rs 51,983 per tonne. Globally, prices also corrected by approximately 12% year-over-year, averaging around $498 per tonne. Although potential production cuts in China may provide some support, weak steel demand is likely to maintain downward pressure on global prices."}, {"bbox": [194, 1306, 1458, 1503], "category": "Text", "text": "However, the Indian government's imposition of a safeguard duty is expected to provide a cushion for domestic prices. Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, HRC prices are anticipated to increase by 2.5-4.5%, following a 10% decline in fiscal 2025. This upward trend is expected to be driven by the recent announcement of a 12% provisional safeguard duty on certain non-alloy and alloy flat steel products, which will help mitigate the impact of cheaper imports and support domestic prices. Overall, the Indian steel industry is poised for a moderate recovery in fiscal 2026, driven by government support and a potential uptick in demand."}]
