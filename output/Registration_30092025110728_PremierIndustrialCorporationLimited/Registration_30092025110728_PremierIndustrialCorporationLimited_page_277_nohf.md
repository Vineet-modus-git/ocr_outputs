b) <u>USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT('PPE') AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS</u>

Management reviews the estimated useful lives and residual value of PPE and Intangibles at the end of each reporting period. Factors such as changes in the expected level of usage, technological developments and product life-cycle, could significantly impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets. Consequently, the future depreciation charge could be revised and may have an impact on the profit of future years.

c) <u>EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS</u>

Employee benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments. These include the estimation of the appropriate discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, the employee benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

**Short-Term Employee Benefits:**

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the services are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus, ex-gratia and compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is charged to the Statement of profit and loss in the period in which such services are rendered.

d) PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of each being subject to uncertainties inherent in litigation. A provision for litigation is made when it is considered probable that a payment will be made and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required when evaluating the provision including, the probability of an unfavourable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of potential loss. Litigation provisions are reviewed at each accounting period and revisions made for the changes in facts and circumstances.

Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the notes forming part of the financial statements. Contingent assets are not disclosed in the financial statements unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

e) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The functional currency of Premier Industrial Corporation Limited (i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates) is the Indian Rupee ("₹").

On initial recognition, all foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in a foreign currency, are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of statement of assets and liabilities and the resultant exchange gains or losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
