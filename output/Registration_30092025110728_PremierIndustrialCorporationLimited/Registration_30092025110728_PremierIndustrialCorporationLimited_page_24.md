FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Draft Red Herring Prospectus contains certain statements which are not statements of historical fact and may
be described as "forward-looking statements". These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by
words or phrases such as "aim", "anticipate", "believe", "goal", "expect", "estimate", "intend", "objective",
"plan", "project", "should" "will", "will continue", "seek to", "will pursue" or other words or phrases of similar
import. Similarly, statements that describe our strategies, objectives, plans or goals are also forward-looking
statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward-looking statement. For
the reasons described below, we cannot assure investors that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking
statements will prove to be correct. Therefore, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-
looking statements and not to regard such statements as a guarantee of future performance.

These forward-looking statements are based on our present plans, estimates and expectations and actual results
may differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements.

Although we believe that the assumptions on which such statements are based are reasonable, any such assumptions as well as statements based on them could prove to be inaccurate. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements due to risks or uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, but not limited to, regulatory changes pertaining to the industry in which we operate and our ability to respond to them, our ability to successfully implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general economic and political conditions in India and globally, which have an impact on our business activities or investments, the monetary and fiscal policies of India, inflation, deflation, volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices or other rates or prices, the performance of the financial markets in India and globally, changes in laws, regulations and taxes, changes in competition in our industry, incidence of natural calamities and/or acts of violence.

Certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our Company’s expectations
include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. We rely on third-party suppliers for raw materials, and any disruption in supply or price fluctuations may adversely affect our business.

2. A significant portion of our revenue comes from powder products, and reduced demand could impact our financial performance.

3. Delays or cost overruns in implementing our expansion and growth plans may negatively affect our operations and profitability.

4. Our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, and disruptions in these regions could impact our business.

5. Our exports are subject to foreign government policies, and any adverse changes may affect our revenue and growth prospects.

6. We have experienced negative cash flows from operations in the past and may continue to do so in the future.

7. Our domestic revenue is concentrated in the western and southern regions of India, and adverse developments in these areas may impact our business.

8. We are dependent on timely and adequate supply of raw materials, and any shortage or delay may affect our operations.

9. We depend on a few customers without long-term contracts, and the loss of any major customer may impact our revenues.

10. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from repeat orders, and a decline in such orders may adversely affect our financial performance.
