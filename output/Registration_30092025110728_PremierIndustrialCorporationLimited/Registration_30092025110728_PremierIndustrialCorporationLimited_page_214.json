If not available in stock, procurement is initiated.\n2. Raw Material Inspection\nAll procured raw materials are inspected for chemical composition and quality parameters. Based on results, materials are either approved, recycled, remelted, or rejected.\n3. Melting (if required)\nWhere necessary, raw materials are melted in furnaces to achieve the required form before further processing.\n4. Testing of Material\nMelted or processed raw material undergoes quality testing to ensure it meets specifications. Materials are again approved, recycled, remelted, or rejected based on results.\n5. Crushing\nApproved material is subjected to crushing operations to reduce it into smaller, manageable sizes.\n6. Grinding\nThe crushed material is further ground to finer sizes to prepare it for subsequent steps.\n7. Sieving\nThe ground material is passed through sieves to classify and separate it according to the required size specifications.\n8. Agglomeration and Blending\nWhere required, the material is agglomerated and blended with flux or additives to achieve uniformity.\n9. Atomization (if required)\nIn specific cases, the material undergoes atomization to produce fine powder with controlled characteristics.\n10. Testing and Quality Control\nThe processed material is tested for physical, chemical, and structural properties. Based on test results, it is either approved, recycled, remelted, or rejected.\n11. Packaging and Labelling\nApproved material is packaged and labelled in accordance with customer and regulatory requirements.\n12. Final Inspection and Dispatch\nAll packaged material undergoes a final inspection before dispatch to ensure quality compliance.\n13. Customer Feedback\nPost-dispatch, customer feedback is collected to enhance quality and improve future processes."}, {"bbox": [193, 2020, 1457, 2123], "category": "Text", "text": "Our manufacturing process for welding consumables, particularly metal and alloy wires, is structured to ensure product quality, process efficiency, and compliance with customer specifications.
