## 2. Flux-cored wires

Flux-cored wires are a type of welding raw material & consumable used in flux-cored arc welding (FCAW), a process that is similar to MIG welding but uses a tubular wire filled with flux instead of a solid wire. The flux within the wire provides shielding from the atmosphere, stabilises the arc, and can add alloying elements to the weld pool. These account for ~20% (44 KTPA) of the Indian welding wire market.

Flux-cored wires can be broadly categorised into two main types based on the shielding method they require:

<table><thead><tr><th>Wire type</th><th>Self-shielded flux-cored wires (FCAW-S)</th><th>Gas-shielded flux-cored wire (FCAW-G)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Brief</th><td>Self-shielded flux-cored wires do not require an external shielding gas because the flux within the wire produces enough shielding gas to protect the weld from atmospheric contamination.</td><td>Gas-shielded flux-cored wires require an external shielding gas (usually carbon dioxide or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide) to protect the weld from the atmosphere. The flux inside the wire assists in stabilising the arc and adding alloying elements.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Key characteristics</th><td>They have higher deposition rates compared with stick electrodes and are suitable for welding thicker materials and creating strong welds in a single pass. These wires often produce more spatter and require slag removal.</td><td>They produce cleaner welds with less spatter compared with self-shielded wires and are suitable for both thin and thick materials. They also require a shielding gas setup, making it less portable for fieldwork.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Application</th><td>Ideal for outdoor welding, construction and shipbuilding, and in environments where wind may disrupt the shielding gas when using gas-shielded methods.</td><td>Used in structural steel fabrication, manufacturing and industries requiring high-quality welds with good mechanical properties.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The material used for flux-cored wires mostly includes mild steel (~80%, 30 KTPA), stainless steel (~10%, 4 KTPA) and nickel (~4%, 1 KTPA).

## 3. Submerged arc welding (SAW) wires

Submerged arc welding wire is an essential component of the submerged arc welding process, known for its high efficiency, quality and suitability for thick materials. SAW wires account for ~18% (39 KTPA) of the welding wires and are mostly made of mild steel, constituting ~70% (27 KTPA) of overall SAW wires.

The process's ability to provide high deposition rates, minimal spatter and excellent weld properties makes it a preferred choice in below industries:

* Structural steel fabrication: Used for welding large steel structures, such as bridges, buildings and industrial facilities, where high deposition rates and strong welds are required

* Shipbuilding: Extensively used in shipbuilding for welding large steel plates and sections, benefiting from the process's ability to handle thick materials and produce high-quality welds

* Heavy equipment manufacturing: Employed in the manufacturing of heavy machinery and equipment, where the process's efficiency and weld quality are critical

* Pipeline construction: Used in pipeline welding for its ability to produce strong, reliable welds on thick pipeline sections

* Pressure vessels: Applied in the fabrication of pressure vessels and tanks, where high-quality, defect-free welds are essential for safety and performance

## 4. Other specialty wires

This category includes a variety of other welding wires, used for specific applications. Although they constitute a smaller share of the market (~<5%), their demand is growing due to the increasing use of specialised materials and advanced welding techniques in sectors such as automotive, aerospace and high-end manufacturing.

These are mostly used in applications requiring high corrosion resistance, such as food processing, chemical processing and marine industries, as well as in welding non-ferrous metals and alloys.
