Subsequently, the lease liability is

- increased to reflect the accretion of interest; and

- reduced the lease payments made and

- remeasured to reflect any change in the lease term, change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments), or change in option to purchase the underlying assets.

## Measurement of Right of use assets

The Company recognises 'Right-of-Use' assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). The cost of 'Right-of-Use' assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.

Subsequently 'Right-of-Use' assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation; and impairment losses; and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets whichever is short.

The Company has elected not to recognise 'Right of Use' asset and lease liabilities for short term leases of 12 months or less. The Company recognises lease payment associated with these leases as expense on a straight-line basis over lease term.

### Company as lessor

Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset is classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the Company to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.

## m) CASH FLOW STATEMENT:

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.

## n) GOVERNMENT GRANTS

The Company recognized government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed off. When the grant relates to an asset, the Company deducts such grant amount from the carrying amount of the asset.

## o) EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS:

Exceptional items refer to items of income or expense, including tax items, within the statement of profit and loss from ordinary activities which are non-recurring and are of such size, nature or incidence that their separate disclosure is considered necessary to explain the performance of the Company.
