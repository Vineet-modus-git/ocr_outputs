In the welding circuit, welding electrodes serve the purpose of conducting electrical current to the workpiece. At times, electrodes also act as filler metal, such as in manual arc welding and gas metal arc welding in the form of consumable electrodes. There are three key types of electrodes-bar electrodes, light-coated electrodes, and shielded arc electrodes. These are the most widely used consumables and come in two main types — stick electrodes (manual metal arc welding) and wire electrodes (used in gas metal arc welding and submerged arc welding).
