Note:

(i) Investments - Non-current - is classified in Level 3 of Fair Value Hierarchy

(ii) Other financial asset - current - is classified in Level 2 of Fair Value Hierarchy

### (b) Fair valuation techniques

The Company maintains policies and procedures to value financial assets or financial liabilities using the best and most relevant data available. The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The management assessed that fair value of Trade receivables (net), Cash and cash equivalents, Loans - current, Other financial asset - current, Borrowings - Current, Trade payables and Other financial liabilities - current approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

### (c) Fair value hierarchy

Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value in the financial statement and are grouped into three levels of a fair value hierarchy. The three Levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:

Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

## 49 Risk management framework

The Company's financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company's financial risk management policy is set by the Board. The Company is exposed to various financial risks. These risks are categorised into market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:

* Credit risk;

* Liquidity risk;

* Market risk

### (a) Credit risk:

Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and other financial instruments.

#### Trade receivable

Customer credit risk is managed by the business unit subject to the Company's established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. To manage trade receivable, the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial conditions, economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and aging of such receivables. For receivables, as a practical expedient, the Company computes expected credit loss allowance based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix is prepared based on historically observed default rates over the expected life of trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in Note 49. The Company does not hold collateral as security.

#### Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the management in accordance with the Company's policy. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the management on an annual basis, and may be updated throughout the year. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty's potential failure to make payments.

### (b) Liquidity risk:

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to Company's reputation.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Company's debt financing plans, covenant compliance and compliance with internal statement of financial position ratio targets.

(i) Maturities of financial liabilities:

The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date:
