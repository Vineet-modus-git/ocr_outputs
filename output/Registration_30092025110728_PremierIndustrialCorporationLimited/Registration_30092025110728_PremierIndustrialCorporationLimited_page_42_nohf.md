Given that our revenues are significantly dependent on our export sales, we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations due to the revenues that we receive. Further, our overseas operations are subject to risks that are specific to each country and region in which we operate, as well as risks associated with overseas operations in general. These risks include complying with changes in foreign laws, regulations and policies relating to foreign trade and investment, including restrictions on trade, import and export license requirements, and tariffs and taxes, intellectual property enforcement issues. Further, increased trade controls or sanctions as a result of political or economic conflicts including, among others, economic disruption may also affect our ability to market or sell our products, in the relevant country. Interest rate hikes may increase our customers' costs of borrowing and business expenses, reducing their disposable capital and inclination to make capital investments in projects where our products are applied. Certain other factors such as inflation, recession or other changes in economic conditions may also adversely affect the cost of our operations. If we are unable to effectively address or comply with changes in foreign laws, or meet the conditions stipulated in our certificates granted by the relevant foreign regulatory agencies, we may be subject to penalties and other regulatory actions, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, result of operations and financial condition.

**6. We have had negative cash flow from operating activities in recent past, and we may continue to have negative operating cash flows in the future.**

The following table sets forth net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating, investing and financing activities for Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023:

(₹ in million)

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>Fiscal 2025</th><th>Fiscal 2024</th><th>Fiscal 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net cash flow operating activities</td><td>(113.74)</td><td>176.76</td><td>68.75</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flows used in investing activities</td><td>(70.42)</td><td>33.76</td><td>(34.55)</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flows used in financing activities</td><td>110.46</td><td>(158.81)</td><td>(54.17)</td></tr></tbody></table>

We cannot assure you that our net cash flows will be positive in the future. If our Company is not able to generate sufficient cash flows, our Company may not be able to generate sufficient amounts of cash flow to finance our projects, make new capital expenditure, make new investments or fund other liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In Fiscal 2025, we have experienced negative cash flow in operating activities primarily due to (i) our Company having adopted a strategy of purchasing higher inventory at lower costs (on account of reduction in raw material prices) to mitigate potential price surge risks; and (ii) increase in trade receivables. As a result, a larger portion of funds was allocated towards inventory procurement.
