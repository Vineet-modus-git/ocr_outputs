There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Equity Shares will develop or be sustained after this Offer. The Offer Price of our Equity Shares is proposed to be determined by our Company based on various factors and assumptions, in consultation with the BRLM through the Book Building Process and may not be indicative of the market price of our Equity Shares at the time of commencement of trading of our Equity Shares or at any time thereafter. The Offer Price is based on certain factors, including our Key Performance Indicators, as described under \"Basis for Offer Price\" on page 138. The market price of our Equity Shares may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations in our operating results, market conditions specific to the industries and the countries in which we operate, developments relating to India and volatility in the stock exchanges and securities markets elsewhere in the world. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Equity Shares, regardless of our Company's performance. In addition, following the expiry of the six-month locked-in period on certain portions of the pre-Offer Equity Share capital, the pre-Offer shareholders may sell their shareholding in our Company, depending on market conditions and their investment horizon. Any perception by investors that such sales might occur could additionally affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. Consequently, the price of our Equity Shares may be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your Equity Shares at or above the Offer Price, or at all. A decrease in the market price of our Equity Shares could cause investors to lose some or all of their investment."}, {"bbox": [198, 805, 1454, 874], "category": "Section-header", "text": "71.
