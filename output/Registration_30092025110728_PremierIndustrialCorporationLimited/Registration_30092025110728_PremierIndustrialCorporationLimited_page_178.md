- Ceriated Tungsten (2% ceriated): Provides better arc starts and is suitable for welding both steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminium
- Lanthanated tungsten: Offers a balance between arc starting and longevity, suitable for various materials.

## Composition and coatings

* **Core material:** The core of the electrode is typically made of a metal compatible with the materials being welded such as mild steel, stainless steel, aluminium, or special alloys.

* **Coatings:** Consumable electrodes, especially SMAW electrodes, are coated with flux. The flux serves multiple purposes, such as stabilising the arc, protecting the weld pool from oxidation, and adding alloying elements to the weld. The type of coating varies:

- **Cellulosic coating:** Produces a deep penetrating arc, suitable for vertical and overhead welding

- **Rutile coating:** Provides a smooth arc and is easy to use, producing aesthetically pleasing welds

- **Basic or low-hydrogen coating:** Reduces hydrogen content in the weld, preventing cracking, and is ideal for high-strength steels

One of the most prevalent types of consumable electrodes includes stick electrodes.

## Stick electrode welding

Stick welding, also known as Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), uses a consumable electrode coated in flux to lay the weld. The electrode is commonly referred to as a 'stick' and is essential in creating a stable arc between the metal being welded and the electrode itself. Here are the main types of stick welding electrodes:

## Overview of welding wires

Welding wire, which are used to join materials together by welding them, is a special type of wire. The welding wire functions as a filler metal that melts during welding, mixing with the base material to form a strong bond. During fiscal 2025, welding electrodes accounted for ~40% (218 KTPA) of welding consumables by volume.

Welding wire is available in various materials, such as steel, stainless steel, aluminium and alloys. The material used in the welding wire depends on the metal to be welded.
