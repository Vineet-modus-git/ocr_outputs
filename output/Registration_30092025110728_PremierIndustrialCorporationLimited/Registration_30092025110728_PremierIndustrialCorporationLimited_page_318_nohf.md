4. We have had negative cash flow from operating activities in recent past, and we may continue to have negative operating cash flows in the future.

The following table sets forth net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating, investing and financing activities for Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023:

(₹ in million)

<table><thead><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Fiscal 2025</td><td>Fiscal 2024</td><td>Fiscal 2023</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net cash flow operating activities</td><td>(113.74)</td><td>176.76</td><td>68.75</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flows used in investing activities</td><td>(70.42)</td><td>33.76</td><td>(34.55)</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flows used in financing activities</td><td>110.46</td><td>(158.81)</td><td>(54.17)</td></tr></tbody></table>

We cannot assure you that our net cash flows will be positive in the future. If our Company is not able to generate sufficient cash flows, our Company may not be able to generate sufficient amounts of cash flow to finance our projects, make new capital expenditure, make new investments or fund other liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In Fiscal 2025, we have experienced negative cash flow in operating activities primarily due to (i) our Company having adopted a strategy of purchasing higher inventory at lower costs (on account of reduction in raw material prices) to mitigate potential price surge risks; and (ii) increase in trade receivables. As a result, a larger portion of funds was allocated towards inventory procurement.
