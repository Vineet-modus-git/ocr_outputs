These Powder not only aid in stabilising the arc during welding but also protect the molten weld pool from atmospheric contamination. The demand for metal and ferro alloy Powder used for the flux coating in electrodes stood at ~34 KTPA in fiscal 2025. Common ferro alloys included ferromanganese and ferrosilicon Powder.\n2. **Welding wires:** Filler wires, such as flux-cored wires, contain a core filled with these Powder, allowing for a self-shielding effect that eliminates the need for external shielding gases. In fiscal 2025, almost 6 KTPA of demand for metal and ferro alloy Powder was generated to manufacture such flux cored wires.\n3. **SAW fluxes:** Metal and ferro alloy Powder are directly used in the SAW process. They offer several benefits such as additional heat during welding operations and improved quality of high strength welds. Fluxes are crucial in processes such as SAW and FCAW. The manufacturing of SAW fluxes generated a direct demand of ~19 KTPA of metal and ferro alloy Powder in fiscal 2025."}]
