is recognised as Lease liability. The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

## Lease Liabilities

At the initial recognition, the Company measures lease liabilities at present value of all lease payments discounted, using the Company's incremental cost of borrowing, to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.

Subsequently, the lease liability is

- increased to reflect the accretion of interest; and

- reduced the lease payments made and

- remeasured to reflect any change in the lease term, change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments), or change in option to purchase the underlying assets.

### Measurement of Right of use assets

The Company recognises 'Right-of-Use' assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). The cost of 'Right-of-Use' assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.

Subsequently 'Right-of-Use' assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation; and impairment losses; and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets whichever is short.

The Company has elected not to recognise 'Right of Use' asset and lease liabilities for short term leases of 12 months or less. The Company recognises lease payment associated with these leases as expense on a straight-line basis over lease term.

### Company as lessor

Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset is classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the Company to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
