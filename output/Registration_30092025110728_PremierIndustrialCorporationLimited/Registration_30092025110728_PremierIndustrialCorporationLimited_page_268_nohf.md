5. As informed to us by the management of the Company, the predecessor auditor viz. Sudhir C Oltikar & Co., Chartered Accountants did not hold a valid peer review certificate as issued by the 'Peer Review Board' of the ICAI and have therefore, expressed their inability to perform any work on the Restated Financial Information for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 to be included in the DRHP. Hence, in accordance with ICDR Regulations, we have audited the Special Purpose Financial Statements referred above in paragraph 3(b) and issued our special purpose audit report thereon, as referred above in paragraph 4(b). However, we have relied on the audit report issued by the previous auditors in so far as it relates to the Companies Auditors Report Order, 2020 ("CARO, 2020") for our reporting as referred above in paragraph 4(b).
