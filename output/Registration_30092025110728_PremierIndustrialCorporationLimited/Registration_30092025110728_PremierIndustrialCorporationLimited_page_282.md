Repurchase of the Company's own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments.

**_Initial recognition and measurement:_**

All financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company's financial liabilities include loans and borrowings including bank overdraft, trade payable, trade deposits and other payables.

**_Subsequent measurement:_**

All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities, including derivatives and embedded derivatives, which are designated for measurement at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at fair value.

**_Derecognition:_**

Financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying amount of financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

## h) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value with maturity within three months or less from the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks, which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

## i) INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at lower of cost (on First In First Out basis) and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence and other losses, where considered necessary. Cost includes all charges in bringing the goods to their present location and condition, including other levies, transit insurance and receiving charges. Work-in-progress and finished goods include an appropriate proportion of overheads and, where applicable, taxes and duties. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

## j) REVENUE RECOGNITION

### i) Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is usually on delivery of goods, based on contracts with the customers. Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, price concessions, incentives, and returns, if any, as specified in the contracts with the customers. Revenue excludes taxes collected from customers on behalf of the government. Accruals for discounts/incentives and returns are estimated (using the most likely method)
