## Contingency

We have also accounted for an aggregate of ₹28.08 million, which is approximate 5.00% of total estimated cost, as contingency cost towards unforeseen circumstances and/or costs that cannot be reliably estimated at this stage, that could occur when placing the order for the plant and machinery to various vendors. The actual cost of the equipment may increase due to price inflation, further change in currency exchange rate, change in logistics and any other such reasons beyond our control.

## Schedule of Implementation
