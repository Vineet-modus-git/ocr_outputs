The Company makes such an election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, including foreign exchange gain or loss and excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit or loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on derecognition. Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the profit or loss.

### Derecognition of financial instruments

The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset, and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset and recognizes a borrowing for the proceeds received. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

### Impairment of financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset.

The application of a simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historically observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## ii. Financial Liabilities and equity instruments:

### Classification as debt or equity:

Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

### Equity instruments:

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
