Under the Air Act, the relevant state pollution control board may inspect any industrial plant or manufacturing process and give orders, as it may deem fit, for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. Further, under the provisions of the Air Act, the industrial plants and manufacturing processes are required to adhere to the standards for emission of air pollutants laid down by the relevant state pollution control board, in consultation with the central pollution control board. Under the Air Act, the state pollution control boards are empowered to declare air pollution control areas and consent of the state pollution control board is required prior to establishing and operating an industrial plant. The consent by the state pollution control board may contain provisions regarding installation of pollution control equipment and the quantity of emissions permitted at the industrial plant.

The Water Act aims to prevent and control water pollution as well as restore water quality by establishing and empowering the central and state pollution control board. Under the Water Act, any person establishing any industry, operation or process, any treatment or disposal system, using any new or altered outlet for the discharge of sewage or new discharge of sewage, must obtain the consent of the relevant state pollution control board, which is empowered to establish standards and conditions that are required to be complied with. In certain cases, the state pollution control board may cause the local magistrates to restrain the activities of such person who is likely to cause pollution. Penalty for the contravention of the provisions of the Water Act include imposition of fines and/or imprisonment.
