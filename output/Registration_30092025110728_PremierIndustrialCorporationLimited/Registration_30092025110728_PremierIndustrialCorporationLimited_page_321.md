### c) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

Employee benefit obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments. These include the estimation of the appropriate discount rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, the employee benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

**Short-Term Employee Benefits:**

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the services are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus, ex-gratia and compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is charged to the Statement of profit and loss in the period in which such services are rendered.

### d) PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of each being subject to uncertainties inherent in litigation. A provision for litigation is made when it is considered probable that payment will be made and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required when evaluating the provision including, the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of potential loss. Litigation provisions are reviewed at each accounting period and revisions are made for the changes in facts and circumstances.

Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the notes forming part of the financial statements. Contingent assets are not disclosed in the financial statements unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

### e) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The functional currency of Premier Industrial Corporation Limited (i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates) is the Indian Rupee ("₹").

On initial recognition, all foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities, denominated in a foreign currency, are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of statement of assets and liabilities and the resultant exchange gains or losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

### a) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE)

An item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle is applied to the costs incurred initially to acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

The cost of PPE includes interest on borrowings directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be made ready for its intended use or sale. Borrowing costs and other directly attributable cost are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use, which generally coincides with the commissioning date of those assets.

The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision is met. Machinery spares that meet the definition of PPE are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the principal item of an asset.

All other repair and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, are recognised in the Restated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. When a replacement occurs, the carrying value of the replaced part is de-recognised.
