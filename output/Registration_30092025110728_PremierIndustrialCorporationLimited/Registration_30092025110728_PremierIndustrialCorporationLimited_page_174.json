Urbanisation, characterised by the migration of people from rural to urban areas, necessitates the creation of new housing and public utilities. Construction heavily relies on metal frameworks, which require welding at various stages, demanding high-quality consumables. In addition, large infrastructure projects such as railways, airports, and dams have long life cycles and ongoing maintenance needs, making the durability of these projects closely linked to the quality of welding. This has prompted contractors and governments to invest in premium welding consumables to ensure longevity and safety."}, {"bbox": [196, 1853, 1457, 1983], "category": "List-item", "text": "3. **Automotive sector growth:** The expansion of the automotive industry in India, including the push towards electric vehicles, requires advanced welding technologies and consumables.
