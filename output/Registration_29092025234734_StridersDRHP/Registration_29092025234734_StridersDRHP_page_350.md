## BIDS BY SEBI-REGISTERED AIFs, VCFs AND FVCIs

The SEBI FVCI Regulations, SEBI VCF Regulations and the SEBI AIF Regulations prescribe, inter alia, the investment restrictions on the FVCIs, VCFs and AIFs registered with SEBI respectively. FVCIs can invest only up to 33.33% of the investible funds by way of subscription to an initial public offering. Category I AIF and Category II AIF cannot invest more than 25% of the investible funds in one investee company directly or through investment in the units of other AIFs. A Category III AIF cannot invest more than 10% of the investible funds in one investee company directly or through investment in the units of other AIFs. AIFs which are authorized under the fund documents to invest in units of AIFs are prohibited from offering their units for subscription to other AIFs. A VCF registered as a Category I AIF, as defined in the SEBI AIF Regulations, cannot invest more than 1/3rd of its investible funds by way of subscription to an initial public offering of a venture capital undertaking. Additionally, a VCF that has not re-registered as an AIF under the SEBI AIF Regulations shall continue to be regulated by the SEBI VCF Regulations (and accordingly shall not be allowed to participate in the Issue) until the existing fund or scheme managed by the fund is wound up and such funds shall not launch any new scheme after the notification of the SEBI AIF Regulations.

There is no reservation for Eligible NRIs, FPIs and FVCIs and all Bidders will be treated on the same basis with other categories for the purpose of allocation.

Further, the shareholding of VCFs, category I AIFs or category II AIFs and FVCIs holding Equity Shares prior to Issue, shall be locked-in for a period of at least one year from the date of purchase of such Equity Shares.

All non-resident investors should note that refunds, dividends and other distributions, if any, will be payable in Indian Rupees only and net of bank charges and commission.
