ANNEXURE TO THE STATEMENT OF POSSIBLE SPECIAL TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY
AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS

The information provided below sets out the possible special tax benefits available to the Company and the Equity Shareholder under the Income Tax Act 1961 (read with the rules, circulars and notifications issued in connection thereto), as amended by the Finance Act, 2021 presently in force in India. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive and is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice. Investors are advised to consult their own tax consultant with respect to the tax implications of an investment in the Equity Shares particularly in view of the fact that certain recently enacted legislation may not have a direct legal precedent or may have a different interpretation on the benefits, which an investor can avail.

A. SPECIAL TAX BENEFITS TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE INCOME TAX ACT, 1961 (THE “ACT”)

Benefit of deduction of additional employee cost under section 80JJAA:

In accordance with and subject to fulfilment of conditions as laid out under Section 80JJAA of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 ('IT Act') the Company may be entitled to claim deduction of an amount equal to thirty per cent of additional employee cost (relating to specified category of employees) incurred in the course of business in the previous year, for three assessment years including the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which such employment is provided.

Benefit of lower rate of tax under Section 115BAA of the Act and corresponding benefit under Minimum Alternative Tax ('MAT') provisions under section 115JB of the Act:

Section 115BAA has been inserted in the Act by the Finance Act, w.e.f. FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21), which grants an option to all domestic companies to compute corporate tax at a reduced rate of 25.168% (22% plus surcharge of 10% and cess of 4%). The said benefit is available subject to the condition that the Company does not claim the deductions/incentives as specified in subclause 2(i) of section 115BAA of the Act. In case a company opts for section 115BAA of the Act, provisions of MAT under section 115JB of the Act would not be applicable and MAT credit of the earlier year(s) will not be available for set-off.
The option needs to be exercised on or before the due date of filing the tax return of a specific year. Option once exercised, cannot be subsequently withdrawn for the same or any other tax year. The Company has opted for the lower tax regime under section 115BAA from FY 2019-20.
