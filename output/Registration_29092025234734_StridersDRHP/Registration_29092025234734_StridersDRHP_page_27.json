OVERVIEW OF INDUSTRY"}, {"bbox": [80, 588, 1578, 969], "category": "Text", "text": "A significant trend that is revolutionizing the global toy industry is the rise in popularity of educational toys, which is being fuelled by rapid technological innovation, shifting parental attitudes, improvements in child psychology, and an increasing focus on early childhood education. These days, educational toys—which combine play and learning—are seen as vital components of a child's development rather than simply extra or optional items. Through entertaining and engaging activities, these toys seek to develop children's motor, social, emotional, and cognitive abilities. The way parents view play has changed significantly over the past ten years. More than ever, they are actively looking for toys that provide both fun and significant educational value because they intend to prepare their kids for a world that is becoming more competitive and changing quickly. This change has its roots in contemporary parenting theories that prioritize experiential learning and holistic growth. Today's parents want toys that support language development, problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creativity, and early literacy and numeracy rather than just providing entertainment for their kids. Because of this, toys that teach STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills—like puzzles, building kits, coding robots, and electronic learning tools—have become increasingly popular in both developed and emerging markets."}, {"bbox": [80, 1003, 1578, 1140], "category": "Text", "text": "The increasing amount of scientific research emphasizing the value of early childhood learning is one of the main causes of the popularity of educational toys. The first five years of life are when the brain is most responsive to learning, according to developmental psychology studies.
