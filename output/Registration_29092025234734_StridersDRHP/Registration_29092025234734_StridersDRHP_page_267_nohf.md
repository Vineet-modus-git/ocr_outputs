**7. Taxes on Income:**

**Current Tax:** Striders Impex Limited (Formerly known as Striders Impex Private Limited) is recognized as a startup by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and is eligible for a tax deduction under Section 80-IAC of the Income Tax Act for the period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2025 (i.e., FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25). Accordingly, no provision for current tax has been made. However, Striders Distribution and Services Private Limited is liable to pay income tax in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and Striders FZ LLC, being a foreign entity, is subject to taxation under the laws of the respective foreign jurisdiction. Therefore, current tax has been provided for both entities as applicable.

**Deferred Tax:** Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax bases. They are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Changes in tax rates affect deferred taxes in the period of enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized when there is reasonable certainty of future realization; in cases of unabsorbed depreciation or carryforward losses, recognition requires virtual certainty backed by convincing evidence. These assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date. The net balance is presented as a deferred tax asset or liability and is used solely to reverse timing differences as they materialize.

**8. Inventories:**

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, conversion, and other costs necessary to bring the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.

Effective from 1st April, 2024, the Company includes landing costs such as freight, import duties, and handling charges as part of inventory cost.

**9. Foreign Exchange Differences:**

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company has incurred a net foreign exchange loss of ₹ 6.28 Lakhs, which has been recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss under "Other Expenses".

**10. Earnings per Share:**

The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with the 'AS 20 - Earnings per share' issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The Basic EPS has been computed by dividing the income available to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Equity shares outstanding during the accounting year. The Diluted EPS has been computed using the weighted average number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the end of the year.

**11. Retirement Benefits:**

**Gratuity:** The Company's obligations towards defined benefit plans and other long-term employee benefits, are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method which is suggested under Accounting Standard 15 (Revised 2005). The valuation of the gratuity liability is carried out by a Registered Valuer. Based on the valuation, the gratuity liability has been classified into current and non-current components, with ₹ 672 recognized as a current liability and ₹ 3.00 Lakhs as a non-current liability.

**12. Borrowing Cost:**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset (one that requires a substantial period to prepare for its intended use or sale) are capitalized as part of that asset until it is substantially ready for its intended use or sale.
