The Company has made strategic investments and efforts to develop, market, and expand its portfolio of proprietary brands, including but not limited to “Pugs at Play, Furry Pals, Fanster, Gurliez, Boujee, Minds at Play and Beezy kits”. While these brands represent a significant growth opportunity and potential for enhanced margins compared to licensed products, their successful scale-up remains contingent upon several factors, including consumer acceptance, brand recall, pricing competitiveness, distribution reach, marketing effectiveness, and product innovation.

The toy industry is characterized by rapidly changing consumer trends, intense competition from established global and local brands, and evolving safety and quality regulations. Any inability to effectively position and differentiate the Company’s proprietary brands in this environment may result in lower-than-anticipated sales volumes, excessive promotional expenses, or markdowns, thereby adversely affecting profitability.

Furthermore, the establishment and expansion of in-house brands require sustained investment in brand building, advertising, R&D, packaging, and promotional strategies. There is no assurance that such investments will generate proportionate or profitable returns. A failure to achieve sufficient scale in own-brand sales may result in continued reliance on third-party licensed products, limiting strategic flexibility and impacting long-term financial performance.

**43. The Company faces risks of inventory obsolescence and overstocks. Poor demand forecasting or shifts in consumer preferences may cause excess or outdated inventory. This can increase holding costs and reduce profits. Such risks impact working capital and financial results.**

The Company operates in a highly dynamic and trend-sensitive industry, where consumer preferences, popular character franchises, and seasonal demand patterns can shift rapidly. A significant portion of the Company’s inventory consists of licensed and proprietary products, the demand for which may decline unexpectedly due to changes in market trends, licensing cycles, media popularity, or competitive offerings.

There is an inherent risk that the Company may overestimate market demand or misjudge the product mix required, resulting in accumulation of excess or slow-moving inventory. Additionally, licensed products often have a defined commercial shelf life linked to the term of the underlying license agreement or the continued popularity of the character or brand, beyond which such products may become commercially unviable or require markdowns.

Further, proprietary branded products may also become obsolete due to evolving consumer preferences, design fatigue, or entry of competing products with superior features or lower price points. The risk is compounded in cases where inventory has been procured in anticipation of projected sales volumes that do not materialize due to external or internal factors.

Such situations may require the Company to sell inventory at discounted rates, write-down or write-off inventory value, or incur additional storage and warehousing costs. These outcomes could adversely impact the Company’s margins, working capital cycle, and overall financial performance. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to accurately forecast demand or avoid inventory obsolescence in the future.

**44. The Company is exposed to risks arising from seasonal fluctuations in demand in the kids’ merchandising and toy industry**

The kids’ merchandising and toy industry is inherently seasonal, with peak demand typically observed during festive seasons with holidays and gift-giving occasions. In addition, demand for the Company’s back-to-school collection, including bags and school accessories, is subject to region-specific fluctuations driven by varying academic calendars across different parts of India.

During off-peak periods, sales volumes are relatively lower, which may result in reduced revenue, excess inventory, and higher holding costs. Conversely, peak seasons require accurate forecasting and effective coordination of procurement, production, and logistics to ensure timely product availability. Any disruption or misjudgment during these periods may lead to stockouts, missed sales opportunities, or delays in fulfilling customer demand, which could adversely impact revenue and market share.

Seasonal fluctuations also exert pressure on working capital and cash flow, as the Company must build up inventory and manage operating expenses ahead of high-demand periods, while revenue realization is concentrated within shorter cycles.

Although the Company seeks to mitigate the effects of seasonality through product diversification, broad distribution coverage, and targeted marketing strategies, there can be no assurance that such measures will fully offset these risks. Accordingly, seasonal variations in demand may materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.

**45. Our Company may be exposed to penalties for non-compliance with UAE regulatory requirements, including UBO, AML/CFT, VAT, and Free Zone regulations.**

Our overseas operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements in the United Arab Emirates, including but not limited to Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) regulations, Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism
