The IT Act facilitates electronic commerce by recognizing contracts concluded through electronic means, protects intermediaries in respect of third-party information liability and creates liability in the form of payment of damages by way of compensation on a body corporate for failure to protect sensitive personal data. The IT Act also prescribes civil and criminal liability including fines and imprisonment for computer related offences including those relating to unauthorized access to computer systems, tampering with or unauthorised manipulation of any computer, computer system or computer network and damaging computer systems, and creates liability for negligence in dealing with or handling any sensitive personal data or information in a computer resource and in maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures in relation thereto, among others.

The IT Act empowers the Government of India to formulate rules with respect to reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data. In exercise of this power, the Department of Information Technology, (DoIT) Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, in April 2011, notified the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (IT Security Rules) which prescribe directions for the collection, disclosure, transfer and protection of sensitive personal data by a body corporate or any person acting on behalf of a body corporate. The IT Security Rules require every such body corporate to provide a privacy policy for handling and dealing with personal information, including sensitive personal data, ensuring security of all personal data collected by it and publishing such policy on its website. The IT Security Rules further require that all such personal data be used solely for the purposes for which it was collected, and any third-party disclosure of such data is made with the prior consent of the information provider, unless contractually agreed upon between them or where such disclosure is mandated by law.

The DoIT also notified the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Intermediary Rules) requiring intermediaries and publishers receiving, storing, transmitting, or providing any service with respect to electronic messages or any other information to not knowingly host, publish, transmit, select or modify any information prohibited under the IT Intermediary Rules, to disable hosting, publishing, transmission, selection or modification of such information once they become aware of it, as well as specifying the due diligence to be observed by intermediaries. The IT Intermediary Rules further requires the intermediaries to provide for a grievance redressal mechanism and appoint a nodal officer and a resident grievance officer.
