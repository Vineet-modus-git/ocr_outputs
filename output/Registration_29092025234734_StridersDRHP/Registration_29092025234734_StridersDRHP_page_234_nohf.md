### 3. Depreciation:

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is provided on Written Down Value Method as per useful life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.

Amortization of Intangible Fixed assets is provided on SLM Basis as per Useful life prescribed in 'AS 26 - Intangible Assets'.

Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its estimated residual value.

The useful life of the assets are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Useful life</td><td>Remarks</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Computers and Printers</td><td>3-5 Years</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>3 Years</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vehicle</td><td>8 Years</td><td rowspan="3">As per Schedule II of companies Act</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and Fixtures</td><td>3 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Intangible Assets</td><td>3 Years</td></tr></tbody></table>

### 4. Taxes on Income:

**Current Tax:** Tax expense comprises of current and deferred tax. Current income tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. The company is recognized as a startup by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and is eligible for a tax deduction under Section 80-IAC of the Income Tax Act for the period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2025 (FY 2023-24 & 2024-25). Accordingly, no provision for current tax has been made for these financial years.

**Deferred Tax:** Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax bases. They are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Changes in tax rates affect deferred taxes in the period of enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized when there is reasonable certainty of future realization; in cases of unabsorbed depreciation or carryforward losses, recognition requires virtual certainty backed by convincing evidence. These assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date. The net balance is presented as a deferred tax asset or liability and is used solely to reverse timing differences as they materialize.

### 5. Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, conversion, and other costs necessary to bring the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.

Effective from April 01, 2024, the Company revised its inventory costing policy to include landing costs such as freight, import duties, and handling charges as part of inventory cost. Previously, such costs were expensed as incurred.

### 6. Change in Accounting Policy:

**Inclusion of Landing Costs in Inventory Valuation**

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company changed its accounting policy regarding the measurement of inventory cost to include landing costs (e.g., freight, duties, handling) as part of inventory valuation. Prior to the change these costs, directly attributable to the acquisition of the inventory, were charged to the statement of Profit and Loss instead of being apportioned to the cost of Inventory.

The management believes this change results in a more faithful representation of inventory value and is consistent with the requirements of AS 2 – Inventories, which states that inventory cost should include all costs necessary to bring the inventories to their present location and condition.

The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively from April 01, 2024, as it was impracticable to determine the cumulative effects on prior periods due to limitations in historical data and systems.

As a result of the change:

* Value of Inventory as at March 31, 2025 increased by ₹ 137.29 Lakhs

* Cost of goods sold for the year decreased by ₹ 137.29 Lakhs

* Net profit before tax increased by ₹ 137.29 Lakhs

### 7. Foreign Exchange Differences:

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company has incurred a net foreign exchange loss of ₹ 6.28 Lakhs, which has been recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss under "Other Expenses". This loss primarily pertains to exchange rate fluctuations on foreign currency transactions and the restatement of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end rates.

### 8. Earnings per Share:

The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with the 'AS 20 - Earnings per share' issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The Basic EPS has been computed by dividing the income available to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Equity shares outstanding during the accounting year. The Diluted EPS has been computed using the weighted average number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the end of the year.
