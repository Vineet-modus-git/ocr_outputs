Moreover, some jurisdictions may lack robust enforcement mechanisms, making our rights difficult to protect. The continued presence of counterfeit products in the market may adversely affect consumer trust, reduce the perceived value of our authentic products, and negatively impact our revenues, margins, and relationships with key licensors.

**59. We may be accused of infringing or misappropriating intellectual property rights or confidential know-how of third parties**

As we continue to develop and market products, including those based on licensed intellectual property ("IP") and our proprietary brands, there is a risk that third parties may allege that our products, packaging, branding, or content infringe upon their existing intellectual property rights or confidential information. These allegations may relate to trademarks, trade dress, designs, whether in India or in international jurisdictions where we operate or intend to expand.

While we take reasonable steps to ensure that our designs and products do not infringe on third-party rights, we may not always be aware of all existing rights or pending applications that could pose conflicts. Additionally, claims of infringement, even if unsubstantiated or frivolous, may lead to litigation, regulatory action, or forced changes in product design or branding, resulting in reputational damage, delays in product launches, or financial liabilities.

Further, defending against such claims could require significant legal and managerial resources and may divert attention from our core operations. Any adverse ruling could lead to monetary penalties, injunctions, or settlement obligations, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.

**60. Exposure to reputational and financial risks due to stringent indemnification clauses in licensing contracts and obligations to global licensors.**

The Company operates in the toys and consumer products sector, wherein a significant portion of its business is based on licensing arrangements with global licensors. These licensors are typically well-known brands and entertainment content owners that grant the Company rights to manufacture, market, and sell licensed products. Such licensing agreements often include stringent indemnification clauses, obligations to comply with brand guidelines, minimum guarantee payments, royalty obligations, and other specific contractual commitments.

Any breach of these licensing agreements, whether actual or alleged, or failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions, could expose the Company to substantial financial liabilities, including indemnification payments, damages, penalties, or claims for lost profits by the licensors. These obligations may be triggered even in cases where the breach arises inadvertently, such as non-compliance with packaging or labelling requirements, quality control issues, or delays in royalty payments.

In addition to financial exposure, such breaches could result in reputational damage, affecting the Company's standing in the market and its relationships with existing licensors. This could hinder the Company's ability to renew current licenses or enter into new licensing arrangements with other global brands.

Given the global nature of the licensors, disputes may also involve complex cross-border legal proceedings, which can be time-consuming, costly, and uncertain in outcome. The Company may also face operational disruptions, as licensors may exercise rights to terminate agreements, suspend supplies, or restrict distribution of licensed products in the event of non-compliance.

Overall, the Company's reliance on licensed intellectual property exposes it to both financial and reputational risks, and any material failure to adhere to these contractual obligations could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, profitability, and prospects.
