in renewal, non-renewal, or cancellation of the Trade Licence could result in termination of the Company's rights to use the facility, thereby adversely impacting its ability to continue operations from the said location.

## 29. Potential misalignment between shareholder records in India and UAE (FY25 shareholding shows 100% held by Striders Impex Pvt. Ltd. (India) whereas the audited and review report shows different individual shareholders)

The Company had previously identified a misalignment between its shareholder records in India and those maintained by its UAE entity, Striders FZ LLC. As per the FY25 shareholding in India, 100% of shares are held by Striders Impex Private Limited (India), whereas the audited and review reports for the UAE entity reflected a different set of individual shareholders. Although this issue has been resolved and the records have been reconciled, there can be no assurance that similar discrepancies will not arise in the future, particularly given the differences in corporate governance, regulatory frameworks, and reporting requirements across jurisdictions.

Any future misalignment or inconsistency between the shareholder records in India and the UAE could expose the Company to a range of risks, including:

* **Regulatory scrutiny** from authorities in India, the UAE, or other jurisdictions, which may require explanations, disclosures, or corrective actions;

* **Challenges in corporate governance**, including difficulties in board decision-making, approval of shareholder resolutions, or compliance with statutory requirements;

* **Complications in financial consolidation**, potentially affecting the preparation and accuracy of consolidated financial statements;

* **Potential ownership disputes**, which may arise if any party questions the accuracy of shareholding records or asserts rights inconsistent with the reconciled records;

* **Operational and reputational impact**, arising from prolonged investigations, corrective filings, or public perception issues.

Given the cross-border nature of the Company's operations and the potential for differing legal interpretations or procedural requirements, even minor discrepancies could have material operational, financial, or regulatory consequences. While the Company has taken corrective steps to align the records and mitigate such risks, there can be no assurance that similar issues will not occur in the future. Any such events could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and disclosures.

## 30. The Company faces the risk of failing to successfully develop its product portfolio. Inability to innovate or expand offerings may limit market competitiveness and growth potential. This could negatively impact revenue and long-term business sustainability.

Our future growth and competitive positioning are significantly dependent on our ability to continuously develop, diversify, and upgrade our product portfolio in line with changing consumer trends, technological advancements, and evolving preferences, particularly in the dynamic and trend-sensitive toy and lifestyle industry.

While we have historically introduced a variety of products based on popular licensed characters and consumer demand, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue identifying market opportunities, executing product innovations, or successfully launching new products in a timely or cost-effective manner. The process of conceptualizing, designing, developing, and commercializing new products involves substantial investment in terms of time, resources, and collaboration with licensors, manufacturers, and marketing partners.

Moreover, new products may face delays in development, failure to obtain regulatory approvals, poor market acceptance, or unfavourable customer feedback, any of which could result in revenue shortfalls, increased write-offs, and brand dilution. If we are unable to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behaviour, emerging technologies, or competing products, our business may be adversely affected.

Additionally, any failure to adequately protect or license intellectual property associated with new product lines or to meet contractual obligations under licensing agreements may further impact our ability to scale or monetize such offerings.

Accordingly, an inability to successfully evolve and expand our product portfolio could materially and adversely affect our growth prospects, financial results, and market reputation.
