## CURRENCY AND UNITS OF PRESENTATION

All references to:

* "Rupees" or "INR" or "Rs." Or "₹" are to the Indian Rupee, the official currency of India;
* "USD" or "US$" or "$" or "U.S. Dollar" are to the United States Dollar, the official currency of the United States of America.

In this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, any discrepancies in any table between the total and the sums of the amounts listed are due to rounding off. All figures derived from our Restated Financial Information in decimals have been rounded off to the second decimal and all percentage figures have been rounded off to two decimal places. However, where any figures may have been sourced from third-party industry sources, such figures may be rounded off to such number of decimal points as provided in such respective sources. In this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, (i) the sum or percentage change of certain numbers may not conform exactly to the total figure given; and (ii) the sum of the numbers in a column or row in certain tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row. Any such discrepancies are due to rounding off.

In this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has presented certain numerical information. All figures have been expressed in "lakhs" of units or in whole numbers where the numbers have been too small to be represented in lakhs. One lakh represents 1,00,000 and ten lakhs represents 10,00,000 and one crore represents 1,00,00,000 and ten crores represents 10,00,00,000. However, where any figures that may have been sourced from third-party industry sources may be expressed in denominations other than lakhs, such figures have been expressed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus in such denominations as provided in their respective sources.
