**7. We rely on third-party manufacturers for product supply, and any disruption in these arrangements could adversely affect our business and operations.**

Our Company relies significantly on third-party manufacturers for the production, assembly, and packaging of its product lines, including both licensed and own-brand offerings. These third-party arrangements form a critical part of our supply chain and operational model, enabling scalability, cost efficiency, and timely market entry. However, reliance on external manufacturers exposes us to risks such as production disruptions, delays in delivery, quality control issues, non-compliance with contractual obligations, and dependence on their financial and operational stability. While our contractual arrangements with Indian manufacturers are formalized through executed agreements, our oversight over their day-to-day operations, procurement practices, labour compliance, inventory management, and adherence to quality and regulatory standards remains inherently limited. Any lapses or deficiencies on their part, whether due to negligence, non-compliance, or capacity constraints, could lead to product quality issues, supply delays, increased costs, or even regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Further, our contractual arrangements with such manufacturers are generally subject to periodic renewals, revisions, and renegotiations, and any inability to maintain these arrangements on favourable terms, or at all, may materially and adversely affect our operations, product availability, financial condition, and overall business performance.

**8. The Company's reliance on purchase order-based arrangements with China-based manufacturers exposes it to potential supply chain disruptions and financial risks**

The Company sources certain products from China-based manufacturers; however, no formal agreements have been executed with these manufacturers. The business relationship is primarily governed by purchase orders, whereby the Company makes partial advance payments and clears the remaining balance only upon shipment of the products. While this approach allows operational flexibility, it exposes the Company to significant operational, financial, and legal risks.

Such arrangements may result in production or shipment delays, inconsistent product quality, or disputes regarding order specifications, pricing, or payment terms. The absence of formal contracts limits the Company's ability to enforce its rights, seek remedies for non-performance, or ensure adherence to agreed quality standards and delivery timelines. In particular, in the event of a dispute or default by a China-based manufacturer, the Company may face difficulties in claiming compensation or recovering advance payments, which could lead to financial losses.

Additionally, reliance on these manufacturers may result in supply chain disruptions, impacting the timely availability of products for sale. Delays or inconsistencies in product delivery could affect inventory management, disrupt order fulfilment, impact customer satisfaction, and lead to reputational harm. Given the international nature of these arrangements, legal recourse may involve cross-border enforcement complexities, higher costs, and extended timelines, which may further exacerbate operational challenges.

Any material disruption, dispute, or default in these arrangements could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's business, revenue, working capital, profitability, and financial position, and may also affect the Company's ability to maintain relationships with distributors and licensors.

**9. Our revenues are dependent on non-exclusive license agreements and few agreements are due to expire between 2025 and 2026, and renewal of these agreements is uncertain.**

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from non-exclusive license agreements that grant us rights to use certain characters, brands, and intellectual property in our product portfolio. Few of the agreements are due to expire between 2025 and 2026. Renewal of such agreements is subject to negotiations with licensors, compliance with contractual obligations, and prevailing commercial terms. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable terms, or at all. Non-renewal or termination of these agreements could materially affect our product offerings, market position, and revenue streams, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**10. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in royalty costs and licensing fee structures. Changes in these expenses can affect cost management. Unfavourable variations may increase operational costs and impact financial performance.**

The Company operates significantly under licensing arrangements with licensors for global brands, wherein it pays royalties, minimum guarantees (MGs), and other fees as part of the contractual obligations under such agreements. These royalty and licensing
