A securities transaction tax (\"STT\") is levied on and collected by an Indian stock exchange on which equity shares are sold. Any gain realized on the sale of listed equity shares held for more than 12 months may be subject to long-term capital gains tax in India at the specified rates depending on certain factors, such as STT paid, the quantum of gains and any available treaty exemptions. Accordingly, you may be subject to payment of long-term capital gains tax in India, in addition to payment of STT, on the sale of any Equity Shares held for more than 12 months. STT will be levied on and collected by a domestic stock exchange on which the Equity Shares are sold. Further, any gain realized on the sale of our Equity Shares held for a period of 12 months or less will be subject to short term capital gains tax in India. While non-residents may claim tax treaty benefits in relation to such capital gains income, generally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India's right to impose a tax on capital gains arising from the sale of shares of an Indian company."}, {"bbox": [101, 1284, 1571, 1764], "category": "Text", "text": "Further, the Finance Act, 2019 (\"Finance Act 2019\"), passed by the Parliament of India stipulates that the sale, transfer and issue of certain securities through exchanges, depositories, or otherwise shall be charged with stamp duty.

The stamp duty for transfer of certain securities, other than debentures, on a delivery basis is currently specified under the Finance Act 2019 at 0.015% and on a non-delivery basis is specified at 0.003% of the consideration amount.

Such taxes will be withheld by the Indian company paying dividends. The Government of India has recently announced the Union Budget for Financial Year 2025 (\"Budget\"). Pursuant to the Budget, the Finance (No.2) Act, 2024 was enacted which inter alia increased the rate of taxation of short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains arising from transfer of an equity share.
