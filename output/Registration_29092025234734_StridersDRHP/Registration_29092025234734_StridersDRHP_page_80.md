the minimum Bid Lot, and subject to availability of Equity Shares in the Individual Investor Portion, the remaining available Equity Shares, if any, shall be allocated on a proportionate basis.

(7) The SEBI ICDR Regulations permit the Issue of securities to the public through the Book Building Process, which states that, not less than 15% of the Net Issue shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to Non-Institutional Bidders provided (a) One third of the portion available to non-institutional investors shall be reserved for applicants with an application size of more than two lots and up to such lots equivalent to not more than ₹ 10 lakhs;(b) Two-thirds of the portion available to non-institutional investors shall be reserved for applicants with an application size of more than ₹ 10 lakhs. Provided that the unsubscribed portion in either of the sub-categories specified in clauses (a) or (b) may be allocated to applicants in the other sub-category and not less than 35% of the Net Issue shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to Individual Investor Bidders and not more than 50% of the Net Issue shall be allotted on a proportionate basis to QIBs, subject to valid Bids being received at or above the Issue Price. Accordingly, we have allocated the Net Issue i.e. not more than 50% of the Net Issue to QIB and not less than 35% of the Net Issue shall be available for allocation to Individual Investors and not less than 15% of the Net Issue shall be available for allocation to Non-institutional bidders.

(8) Subject to valid Bids being received at or above the Issue Price, undersubscription, if any, in any category, except in the QIB Portion, would be allowed to be met with spill-over from any other category or combination of categories of Bidders at the discretion of our Company, in consultation with the Book Running Lead Manager and the Designated Stock Exchange, subject to applicable laws.

(9) Our Company may, in consultation with the Book Running Lead Manager, allocate up to 60% of the QIB Portion to Anchor Investors on a discretionary basis in accordance with the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations. One-third of the Anchor Investor Portion shall be reserved for domestic Mutual Funds, subject to valid Bids being received from domestic Mutual Funds at or above the Anchor Investor Allocation Price. In the event of under-subscription in the Anchor Investor Portion, the remaining Equity Shares shall be added to the QIB Portion. Further, 5% of the Net QIB Portion shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to Mutual Funds only, and the remainder of the QIB Portion shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to all QIB Bidders (other than Anchor Investors), including Mutual Funds, subject to valid Bids being received at or above the Issue Price. However, if the aggregate demand from Mutual Funds is less than 5% of the Net QIB Portion, the balance Equity Shares available for allotment in the Mutual Fund Portion will be added to the Net QIB Portion and allocated proportionately to the QIB Bidders (other than Anchor Investors) in proportion to their Bids.
