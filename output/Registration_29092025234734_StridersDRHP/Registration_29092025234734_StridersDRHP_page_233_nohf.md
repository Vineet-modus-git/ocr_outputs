The financial statements have been prepared on accrual basis under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies have been framed, keeping in view the fundamental accounting assumptions of Going Concern, Consistency and Accrual, as also basic considerations of Prudence, Substance over form, and Materiality. These have been applied consistently, except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision in the existing accounting standards require a revision in the accounting policy so far in use. The need for such a revision is evaluated on an ongoing basis.

Based on the nature of products and services, and the time between the acquisition of assets and realization in cash or cash equivalents, the company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purposes of current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

### 2. Use of Estimates:

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date, the results of operation during the reported period and disclosure of contingent liabilities as on the reporting date. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable and are in their best knowledge of current event and actions. Actual results could differ from these estimates and differences between actual results and estimates are recognized in the period in which the results are known or materialize. Significant estimates used by the management in the preparation of these financial statements include provision for employee benefits, estimates of the economic useful life of plant and equipment, provision for expenses, provisioning for taxation etc.
