the CCI or any other competent authority. Any adverse interpretation, investigation, or order by a regulatory authority regarding such arrangements may lead to the imposition of penalties, modification or nullification of agreements, and reputational harm. Furthermore, the evolving nature of competition law jurisprudence in India, combined with increased regulatory vigilance, introduces uncertainty regarding the permissibility and structuring of certain business practices. Any such regulatory action or litigation, whether initiated or threatened, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, or ability to enter into or maintain strategic partnerships and distribution arrangements.

**80. The Company is vulnerable to the adverse impact of inflation and rising operational costs in India. Increased expenses related to raw materials, finished goods procured, labour, and overheads may reduce profit margins and affect overall financial performance.**

Our operations are susceptible to inflationary pressures in India, which may lead to increased costs of raw materials, packaging, logistics, warehousing, manpower, finished goods procured and other operational inputs. Any sustained or sudden rise in inflation levels may materially impact our cost structure, pricing flexibility, and profitability.

While we endeavour to optimize our cost base and pass on increases to customers wherever possible, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so without affecting demand, competitive positioning, or margins. In the event that we are unable to manage inflationary cost increases effectively, it may result in erosion of our operating margins, adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Furthermore, persistent inflation could impact consumer purchasing power and discretionary spending on non-essential goods such as toys and children's merchandise, which may in turn affect overall sales volumes.

**81. The entry of global e-commerce giants or large-scale retailers into India's baby and toy product segment may intensify competition. Such developments could exert pricing pressure, increase customer acquisition costs, and challenge the Company's market share and growth prospects.**

The Indian toy and baby product market is witnessing growing interest from global e-commerce players and large multinational retailers, who possess significant financial, technological, and logistical capabilities. The entry or expansion of such global entities offering wide assortments, aggressive pricing strategies, deep discounting, or exclusive partnerships may intensify competition in the segments in which we operate.

Such players often benefit from economies of scale, established global supplier networks, and access to advanced data analytics and marketing tools, which could adversely impact our ability to retain or grow market share, particularly in urban and high-potential Tier-I and Tier-II markets.

While we continue to strengthen our brand partnerships, distribution network, and e-commerce presence, the aggressive strategies of global entrants could lead to pricing pressures, reduced customer loyalty, increased marketing expenditure, or margin compression. These developments could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition, and operational results.

**82. There is no assurance that the Equity Shares will be listed on the NSE EMERGE Platform in a timely manner or at all**

There is no certainty that the Equity Shares will be listed on the NSE EMERGE Platform within the prescribed timelines or at all. Under Indian law, the approval for listing and commencement of trading of the Equity Shares will only be granted once all actions required in connection with this Issue have been completed and after the Allotment of Equity Shares.

As per the prevailing SEBI regulations and applicable circulars, including the UPI Circulars, Equity Shares are required to be listed within the time frame prescribed therein, subject to any modifications in the applicable regulatory timelines. However, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained or that trading in the Equity Shares will commence as scheduled.

Any delay in, or failure to, secure the final listing and trading approvals could restrict investors from disposing of their Equity Shares on the recognized stock exchange, limit liquidity, and adversely affect the value of their investment.

**83. Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties, including adverse application or interpretation of corporate and tax laws, may adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations**

The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and subject to change. Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavourable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and our business. In such instances, and including the instances mentioned below, our business, results of operations and prospects may be adversely impacted, to the extent that we are unable to suitably respond to and comply with any such changes in applicable law and policy. Any political instability in India, such as corruption, scandals and protests
