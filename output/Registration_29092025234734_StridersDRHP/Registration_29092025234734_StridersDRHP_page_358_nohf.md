The price discovery is a function of demand at various prices. The highest price at which the Issuer is able to Issue the desired number of Equity Shares is the price at which the book cuts off, i.e., Rs. 22.00 in the above example. The Issuer, in consultation with the BRLM, may finalise the Issue Price at or below such Cut-Off Price, i.e., at or below Rs. 22.00. All Bids at or above this Issue Price and cut-off Bids are valid Bids and are considered for allocation in the respective categories.

Anchor Investors are not allowed to withdraw their Bids after Anchor Investors bidding date.
