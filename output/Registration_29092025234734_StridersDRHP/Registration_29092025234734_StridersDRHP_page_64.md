regulatory action, and affect investor confidence, which in turn could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

**53. Broad territorial and character usage restrictions under our licensing contracts may create potential inadvertent breaches, exposing us to legal and financial consequences.**

Our Striders FZ LLC enters into licensing arrangements for use of characters, brands, and other intellectual property in connection with our products. These agreements generally contain detailed restrictions regarding territorial scope, character usage, distribution channels, and product categories. Given the complexity and breadth of such contractual restrictions, there exists a risk of inadvertent breach of the terms, particularly in relation to cross-border transactions, product design, or marketing practices. Any actual or perceived breach may lead to termination of the license, imposition of penalties, claims for damages, or restrictions on future licensing opportunities. Such events could adversely impact our product portfolio, brand value, business operations, and financial performance.

**54. The Company's international operations are exposed to various risks, including regulatory differences, geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations, and compliance challenges. These factors may adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, and growth prospects.**

The Company has presence in United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) through our Wholly Owned Subsidiary and may expand our presence into other international markets in the future. The year ended March 31, 2025, our revenue from international operations was Rs. 1097.81 Lakhs, representing 15.05% of our Total Group Revenue from Operations for FY 2024-25.

Our international business is subject to a number of risks that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects, including:

* Adverse geopolitical or macroeconomic conditions impacting consumer confidence and purchasing behaviour in foreign markets;

* Costs related to localization of our product offerings to suit regional preferences and compliance requirements;

* Limitations on intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions;

* Foreign exchange rate volatility and restrictions on currency convertibility;

* Changes in trade, customs, and import/export regulations;

* Differences in local business practices, legal standards, and cultural expectations;

* Exposure to political unrest, natural disasters, civil disturbances, terrorism, or warfare in international markets.

Additionally, our international operations are subject to a broad range of complex and, at times, conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, including those relating to:

* Data protection, privacy, and potential access to customer or employee data by foreign governments;

* Data localization and residency requirements in specific jurisdictions;

* Tax compliance, cross-border taxation, and interpretation of local tax laws;

* Labour and employment regulations, unionization, and immigration policies;

* Varying insolvency regimes and legal enforcement standards;

* Compliance with local industry-specific standards or certifications.

As we continue to expand our international footprint, the intensity and complexity of these risks may increase. Non-compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations could lead to financial penalties, reputational harm, operational disruptions, or restrictions on our ability to operate in certain markets. Any of these factors, individually or collectively, may adversely affect our global operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

**55. We have not paid any dividends in the past Financial Years. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, working capital requirements and capital expenditures.**

We have not declared or paid any dividends on our Equity Shares in the past financial years. Our future ability to declare dividends will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to our future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, capital expenditure requirements, working capital needs, applicable legal restrictions and other business considerations as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time.
