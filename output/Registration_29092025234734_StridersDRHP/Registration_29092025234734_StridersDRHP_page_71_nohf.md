currency movements, changes in governmental policies (including import/export duties), environmental regulations, geopolitical developments, and supply-demand imbalances.

Further, we source our raw materials and finished products through a supply chain that involves both domestic and international suppliers, including partners in China and other foreign jurisdictions. Disruptions to the supply chain caused by logistical bottlenecks, port congestions, container shortages, labour strikes, natural disasters, pandemics, or international conflicts may delay procurement, production, and order fulfilment, thereby impacting customer satisfaction and revenue realization.

Any prolonged disruption or unpredictability in the pricing or availability of raw materials and supply chain efficiency may adversely impact our margins, increase our working capital requirements, and materially affect our business operations and financial performance.

**75. The Company is exposed to disruptions in the global supply chain and shipping logistics. Such interruptions may cause delays in raw material procurement and product delivery, increasing costs and adversely affecting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.**

Our operations are significantly reliant on a global supply chain ecosystem, with a substantial portion of our products being imported from overseas markets, particularly from the People's Republic of China. Consequently, any disruption in global shipping and logistics networks, including port operations, customs clearance, freight availability, or international transportation corridors, may materially impact our procurement processes, inventory levels, and timely fulfilment obligations.

In recent years, events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine conflict, and Red Sea maritime security crisis have illustrated the fragility of global trade routes. These disruptions resulted in extended lead times, container shortages, unanticipated port closures, surging freight charges, and backlog at key ports all of which contributed to increased landed costs and compromised delivery schedules.

We are particularly exposed to:

*   **Cost Risks:** Any increase in ocean freight rates, customs duties, fuel surcharges, or emergency levies (as observed during post-pandemic recovery periods and ongoing Red Sea tensions) directly increases our input costs and may reduce margins, especially for price-sensitive SKUs.
*   **Availability Risks:** Delays in customs clearances, manufacturing slowdowns in China due to local lockdowns or power restrictions, or bottlenecks at transshipment hubs could impact our ability to maintain optimal inventory levels, thereby affecting the timeliness of product launches and festival-linked sales cycles.

Given the toy industry's dependency on seasonality and content-driven demand, such delays could lead to missed sales opportunities, inventory obsolescence, and order cancellations, adversely affecting our revenues and brand equity. Further, ongoing geopolitical tensions or any future war-like situation involving China could exacerbate these risks, potentially leading to a complete halt in imports from our key supply partners.

Any prolonged or repeated disruptions to global supply chains and shipping logistics may significantly impair our business continuity, financial results, and operational flexibility.

**76. The Company operates across diverse legal and tax jurisdictions, exposing it to complex regulatory compliance and varying tax obligations. This may increase the risk of non-compliance, legal disputes, and unforeseen tax liabilities, potentially impacting financial performance and business operations.**

Our Company, along with its subsidiaries, operates across multiple jurisdictions, both within India and internationally, including the United Arab Emirates through Striders FZ LLC. As we expand our operations globally, we are subject to the laws, regulations, and tax regimes of various countries, each of which imposes distinct compliance obligations and legal frameworks.

Operating across diverse legal and tax jurisdictions exposes us to several inherent risks, including but not limited to:
