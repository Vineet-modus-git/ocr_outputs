## BASIS OF ALLOTMENT

Allotment will be made in consultation with National Stock Exchange of India Limited (The Designated Stock Exchange). In the event of oversubscription, the allotment will be made on a proportionate basis in marketable lots as set forth here:

1. The total number of Shares to be allocated to each category as a whole shall be arrived at on a proportionate basis i.e., the total number of Shares applied for in that category multiplied by the inverse of the over subscription ratio (number of applicants in the category x number of Shares applied for).

2. The number of Shares to be allocated to the successful applicants will be arrived at on a proportionate basis in marketable lots (i.e. Total number of Shares applied for into the inverse of the over subscription ratio).

3. For applications where the proportionate allotment works out to less than [•] equity shares the allotment will be made as follows:

i. Each successful applicant shall be allotted [•] equity shares; and

ii. The successful applicants out of the total applicants for that category shall be determined by the drawl of lots in such a manner that the total number of Shares allotted in that category is equal to the number of Shares worked out as per (2) above.

4. If the proportionate allotment to an applicant works out to a number that is not a multiple of [•] equity shares, the applicant would be allotted Shares by rounding off to the lower nearest multiple of [•] equity shares subject to a minimum allotment of [•] equity shares.

5. If the Shares allocated on a proportionate basis to any category is more than the Shares allotted to the applicants in that category, the balance available Shares for allocation shall be first adjusted against any category, where the allotted Shares are not sufficient for proportionate allotment to the successful applicants in that category, the balance Shares, if any, remaining after such adjustment will be added to the category comprising of applicants applying for the minimum number of Shares.
