price of the Equity Shares at the time of commencement of trading of the Equity Shares or at any time thereafter. The market price of the Equity Shares may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations in our operating results of our Company, market conditions specific to the industry we operate in, developments relating to India, volatility in securities markets in jurisdictions other than India, variations in the growth rate of financial indicators, variations in revenue or earnings estimates by research publications, and changes in economic, legal and other regulatory factors.

**88. Any future issuance of Equity Shares may dilute the shareholding of the Investor, or any sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or other significant shareholder(s) may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.**

Any future issuance of Equity Shares by our Company or sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or significant shareholders may dilute your shareholding, adversely affect the trading price of our Equity Shares, and impact our ability to raise capital. We may, in the future, require additional capital and may raise such capital through further issuance of Equity Shares or other securities. Any future issuance of our Equity Shares could result in the dilution of your shareholding. Further, any sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or other significant shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely affect the trading price of our Equity Shares and could impact our ability to raise capital through an offering of our securities. While the entire post-Offer paid-up share capital will be listed, in accordance with SEBI ICDR Regulations, a minimum of 20% of the post-Offer Equity Share capital of our Company held by our Promoters shall be locked-in for a period of three years from the date of allotment in this Offer. The Promoters' shareholding in excess of the minimum promoter contribution ("MPC") shall be subject to lock-in as follows: (i) 50% of the Promoters' holding in excess of MPC shall be locked-in for a period of two years, and (ii) the remaining 50% of the Promoters' holding in excess of MPC shall be locked-in for a period of one year from the date of allotment in this Offer. The pre-Offer shareholding of other shareholders (i.e., non-promoter shareholders), to the extent not offered in the Offer, shall be locked-in for a period of one year from the date of allotment in this Offer.

For further details relating to lock-in, please refer to the section titled "Capital Structure" beginning on page 90 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. Despite these restrictions, any future issuance or sale of the Equity Shares of our Company by our Promoters or significant shareholders, or any perception or belief that such sales might occur, could significantly affect the market price of our Equity Shares. We cannot assure you that we will not issue Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to Equity Shares or that our Shareholders will not dispose of, pledge or encumber their Equity Shares in the future.

**89. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect the value of the Equity Shares and returns to investors**

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and foreign currencies may adversely impact the value of the Equity Shares, independent of the Company's operating performance. Upon listing, the Equity Shares will be quoted in Indian Rupees on the Stock Exchanges. Dividends, if declared, will be paid in Indian Rupees and, if repatriated, converted into the relevant foreign currency. Any adverse movement in exchange rates during such conversion could reduce the net dividend received by foreign investors.

Similarly, any adverse exchange rate movement during the repatriation of proceeds from the sale of Equity Shares outside India, including delays due to regulatory approvals, may reduce the amount ultimately received by shareholders. For instance, the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the U.S. Dollar has historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to do so in the future. Such volatility may negatively affect the trading price of the Equity Shares and the returns on investment, irrespective of the Company's operational performance.

**90. Foreign investment restrictions under Indian law may limit investment by non-residents and adversely affect the market price of the Equity Shares**

Foreign investors are subject to restrictions under Indian law that may limit the ability to invest in the Equity Shares, which could adversely impact the market price of the Equity Shares. Under the current foreign exchange regulations in India, transfers of shares between residents and non-residents are generally permitted, subject to compliance with pricing guidelines and reporting requirements prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India ("RBI").

If a proposed transfer of shares does not comply with the applicable pricing guidelines or reporting requirements, or falls under exceptions requiring specific approval, prior approval from the RBI will be necessary. Additionally, shareholders seeking to convert Rupee proceeds from the sale of shares in India into foreign currency and repatriate such proceeds must obtain a no-objection or tax clearance certificate from the Income Tax authorities.

There can be no assurance that any approval or clearance required from the RBI, the Income Tax authorities, or any other government agency will be granted on favorable terms or at all. Any inability to obtain such approvals may restrict foreign investment in the Equity Shares and adversely affect their market price.
