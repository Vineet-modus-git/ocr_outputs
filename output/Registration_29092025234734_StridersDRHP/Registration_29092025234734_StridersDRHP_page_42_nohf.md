fee structures may vary from licensor to licensor and are often subject to periodic revision, renegotiation, or escalation based on sales performance, currency fluctuations, or changes in licensor policies.

Any increase in royalty rates, changes in MG thresholds, or imposition of additional compliance requirements under such agreements could materially affect the Company's profit margins. In some cases, the Company may be liable to pay fixed MG amounts regardless of actual sales or revenue generated from licensed products, thereby exposing it to a risk of negative cash flows in case of underperformance of licensed SKUs or decline in product demand.

Additionally, licensors may impose restrictive covenants on the sales channels where products may be sold, as well as marketing and branding obligations that could involve additional costs for the Company. The termination or non-renewal of such licensing arrangements, or a decision by licensors to alter their pricing and fee structures globally, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operational economics and financial condition.

Further, as a significant portion of the Company's revenue is dependent on licensed products, any fluctuation in royalty or fee obligations without a corresponding increase in product pricing power may constrain the Company's ability to scale profitably and maintain its competitive positioning in the market.

**11. Following termination of a license, the Company may be subject to sell-off period restrictions. These limitations could delay the sale or distribution of licensed products, impacting revenue and inventory management. Compliance with such restrictions is essential to avoid legal and financial consequences.**

Upon the expiry or early termination of certain licensing agreements entered into by our Company, the licensors may provide for a limited sell-off period, during which we are permitted to continue selling existing inventory of licensed products. These sell-off rights are subject to specific terms and conditions stipulated in the respective agreements, including restrictions on duration, territory, pricing, and sales platforms.

Such limitations may adversely affect our ability to liquidate unsold stock and may result in potential revenue loss or write-down of inventory. Moreover, any early termination or non-renewal of key licensing arrangements without adequate sell-off provisions or with stringent restrictions could lead to disruptions in our revenue streams, negatively impacting our financial performance and cash flows.

We cannot assure that future licensing arrangements will contain favourable sell-off clauses, or that we will be able to comply with such conditions effectively.

**12. The Company may be obligated to fulfill minimum guarantee payments regardless of product performance. This commitment could result in financial liabilities even when sales targets are not met, potentially affecting profitability and cash flow.**

Our Company has entered into various licensing agreements with third-party intellectual property owners, including but not limited to licensors such as UTV Software Communications Limited, Jio Star India Pvt Ltd, Hasbro consumer products licensing limited, Dream Theatre Pvt Ltd, etc, which covers most of the popular toy brands and IP wherein we are contractually obligated to pay a fixed Minimum Guarantee (MG) amount + of the commercial performance of the licensed products.

These MG obligations are binding and payable even in scenarios where:

* The Company does not manufacture, distribute, or sell any products under the relevant license; or

* The market demand for the licensed product declines significantly due to changing consumer preferences, evolving trends, or product fatigue; or

* The product or character associated with the license fails to perform commercially or is discontinued prematurely by the licensor.

Such non-performance-based commitments expose our Company to a significant financial liability and may result in negative cash flows, erosion of profitability, and potential impairment of assets associated with such licensed products. Further, our ability to recover the MG amount paid is entirely dependent on successful sales performance, which remains inherently uncertain.
