Therefore, this WEO presents a range of global growth projections. First is a “reference forecast” based on measures announced as of April 4. This is what is presented in the tables of this report and the WEO database. Second, a pre-April 2 forecast (with a cutoff date of late March) incorporates all prior policy announcements and economic developments since the October 2024 WEO. Third, a post-April 9 model-based forecast is used to quantify the implications of the announced pause and associated additional exemptions, as well as the escalating tariff rates between China and the United States."}, {"bbox": [131, 488, 1572, 637], "category": "Text", "text": "For advanced economies, growth under the reference forecast is projected to drop from an estimated 1.8 percent in 2024 to 1.4 percent in 2025 and 1.5 percent in 2026.

Rising uncertainty and tariffs are key drivers of the subdued growth in 2025. Offsetting forces that support the modest pickup in 2026 include stronger consumption on the back of rising real wages and a projected fiscal easing in Germany following major changes to its fiscal rule (the “debt brake”). Within the region, Spain’s momentum contrasts with the sluggish dynamics elsewhere. The growth projection for 2025 for Spain is 2.5 percent, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point from that in the January 2025 WEO Update.
