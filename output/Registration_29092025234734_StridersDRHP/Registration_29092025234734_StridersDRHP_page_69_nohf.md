## EXTERNAL RISKS

**69. Risks arising from natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, and socio-political events that may adversely affect business and financial performance.**

Natural disasters (such as cyclones, flooding and earthquakes), epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks and other events, many of which are beyond our control, may lead to economic instability, including in India or globally, which may in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Our operations may be adversely affected by fires, floods, natural disasters and severe weather, which can result in damage to our property or inventory or that of our customers and suppliers, and generally reduce our productivity and may require us to evacuate personnel and suspend operations. Any terrorist attacks or civil unrest as well as other adverse social, economic and political events in India could have a negative effect on us. Such incidents could also create a greater perception that investment in Indian companies involves a higher degree of risk and could have an adverse effect on our business and the price of the Equity Shares.

A number of countries in Asia, including India, as well as countries in other parts of the world, are susceptible to contagious diseases and, for example, have had confirmed cases of diseases such as the highly pathogenic H7N9, H5N1 and H1N1 strains of influenza in birds and swine and more recently the COVID-19 virus. Certain countries in Southeast Asia have reported cases of bird-to-human transmission of avian and swine influenza, resulting in numerous human deaths. A worsening of any current outbreaks or future outbreaks of avian or swine influenza or a similar contagious disease could adversely affect the Indian, Asian or Global economy and economic activity and in turn have an adverse effect on our business and the trading price of the Equity Shares.

**70. A downgrade in India's credit ratings may negatively impact the trading price of the Company's Equity Shares. Such a downgrade could reduce investor confidence and increase market volatility, thereby affecting share valuation.**

Any adverse changes in the sovereign credit rating of India by international rating agencies could impact investor sentiment, increase the risk perception associated with Indian securities, and result in capital outflows from Indian equity markets. Such a downgrade may lead to a decrease in foreign investment in Indian equities, tightening of liquidity, and increased volatility in stock markets, including the market price of our Equity Shares.

Additionally, a rating downgrade may lead to depreciation of the Indian Rupee, increased borrowing costs, and a general slowdown in economic activity, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price at which our Equity Shares trade after the Offer.

**71. Exposure to regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties in India, many of which are beyond or control.**

Our business, financial condition and results of operations are significantly dependent on the prevailing economic, political and social conditions in India. Factors such as changes in government policies or regulations, introduction of new laws or interpretations, economic instability, civil disturbances, social unrest, regional conflicts, terrorism or changes in tax, trade or fiscal policies may adversely affect our operations or the Indian economy in general.

Additionally, changes in central or state government policies, inflation, interest rates, currency fluctuation, and other economic factors may affect business sentiment and consumer spending. Any slowdown in the Indian economy or disruptions caused by political or regulatory developments could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. As we continue to expand domestically and internationally, our exposure to such uncertainties remains a material consideration for our future performance.

Key factors that may adversely affect the Indian economy and, consequently, our performance, include:

* Sluggish growth or contraction in gross domestic product (GDP);

* Volatility in interest rates, inflation levels, or currency exchange rates;

* Changes in trade policies, tariffs, or import/export restrictions;
