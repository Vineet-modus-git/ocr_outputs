**31. Our Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offer for Sale. The Promoter Selling Shareholders will receive the net proceeds from the Offer for Sale.**

The Offer consists of a Fresh Offer and an Offer for Sale. The Promoter Selling Shareholders shall be entitled to the net proceeds from the Offer for Sale, which comprise proceeds from the Offer for Sale net of Offer expenses shared by the Promoter Selling Shareholders, and our Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offer for Sale.

**32. The Company faces payment-related risks, including delays or defaults associated with, B2B credit sales, cash-on-delivery transactions and failures in payment processing systems. These risks may result in revenue loss, increased collection costs, and cash flow disruptions, adversely affecting financial stability.**

Our business model includes transactions processed through various channels including Cash-on-Delivery (COD), prepaid online payments, and B2B credit cycles, each of which exposes us to distinct financial and operational risks.

In case of credit sales to B2B credit cycle, we are exposed to the risk of:

* Delayed or non-payment by debtors, which may result in increased receivable days, potential bad debts, and the need for provisioning;

* Disputes or disagreements regarding invoicing, product quality, or contractual terms, which may delay collections and increase administrative and legal costs;

* Adverse impact on cash flows and working capital management, as delayed collections can affect our ability to meet day-to-day operational expenses, fund inventory procurement, pay suppliers, or make timely royalty and licensing payments;

* Concentration risk, if a significant portion of credit sales is dependent on a few key B2B debtors, making the Company more vulnerable to financial difficulties of those debtors.

In case of COD orders, we are exposed to the risk of:

* High return rates or refusal to accept delivery by customers, resulting in reverse logistics costs and potential inventory damage or obsolescence;

* Cash mismanagement or leakage during collection and remittance, particularly when handled by third-party logistics (3PL) partners;

* Delayed cash flows, affecting our working capital cycle and liquidity planning.

Our electronic payment processing systems, whether through marketplaces, payment gateways, or quick-commerce partners, involve dependency on third-party service providers. Any technical failure, cyber-security breach, transaction dispute, chargeback, or settlement delay may lead to:

* Revenue loss or delayed realization of sales proceeds;

* Fraudulent transactions that may not be recoverable;

* Data breach implications, including violation of data protection laws, consumer trust erosion, and reputational harm.

In jurisdictions outside India, including the UAE where we operate through subsidiaries and partners, variations in payment infrastructure and cross-border remittance rules may also pose compliance, reconciliation, and repatriation risks.

Any failure to effectively manage these payment-related risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, working capital availability, customer experience, and overall business operations.

**33. The Company's historical performance may not reliably predict future results. Changes in market conditions, competition, or internal factors could lead to different outcomes. Investors should not solely rely on past performance when assessing future prospects.**

While the Company has experienced growth in revenue and operations in prior financial years, such historical performance should not be construed as an indicator of the Company's future prospects, performance, or financial results. The Company's growth and profitability are influenced by a variety of internal and external factors including, but not limited to, changes in consumer demand,
