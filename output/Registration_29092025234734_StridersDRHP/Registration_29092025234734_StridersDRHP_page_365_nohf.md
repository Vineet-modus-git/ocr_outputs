1) Total number of specified securities on offer @ `600 per share: 1 crore specified securities.

2) Specified securities on offer for individual investors' category: 35 lakh specified securities.

3) The issue is overall subscribed by 7 times, whereas the individual investors' category is over-subscribed 9.37 times.

4) The issuer has decided the minimum application/bid size as 20 specified securities (falling within the range of ten thousand to fifteen thousand rupees) and in multiples thereof.

5) A total of two lakh individual investors have applied in the issue, in varying number of bid lots i.e. between 1-16 bid lots, based on the maximum application size of up to two lakh rupees.

6) As per the allotment procedure, the allotment to individual investors shall not be less than the minimum bid lot, subject to availability of shares.
