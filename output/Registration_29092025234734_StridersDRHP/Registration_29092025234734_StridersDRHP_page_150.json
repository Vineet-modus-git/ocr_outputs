Physical stores—such as toy shops, department stores, and big-box retailers—allow children and parents to interact directly with products before purchase. This tactile experience is especially important for toys, where size, texture, and functionality play a significant role in buying decisions. In-store displays, product demonstrations, and knowledgeable staff enhance customer engagement and can influence impulse buying. Additionally, offline retail fosters brand visibility and trust, particularly for new or premium toy brands that benefit from physical shelf space and point-of-sale promotions. Seasonal sales, holidays, and events like in-store play zones or character meet-and-greets also drive foot traffic and sales. Moreover, offline retail is more accessible in regions with limited internet connectivity or where e-commerce logistics are underdeveloped. Despite the rise of online shopping, the physical retail experience remains a critical touchpoint for consumers, especially in the toy industry where emotional connection and immediate gratification are key. As a result, many toy manufacturers continue to prioritize offline retail in their distribution strategies, often integrating it with online efforts to create an omnichannel presence."}, {"bbox": [133, 708, 266, 743], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Toy Stores"}, {"bbox": [131, 765, 1571, 1064], "category": "Text", "text": "Toy stores play a crucial role in the toy retail industry by offering a specialized and immersive shopping experience.
