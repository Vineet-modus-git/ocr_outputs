Our Managing Director, Mr. Kumarshri Rajkumar Bahety, unintentionally obtained two Director Identification Numbers (“DINs”), namely DIN 08459040 and DIN 09159697. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 155 of the Companies Act, 2013, an individual who has already been allotted a DIN under Section 154 is prohibited from applying for, obtaining, or possessing another DIN.

DIN ‘09159697’ is currently used in all filings of the Company, whereas DIN ‘08459040’, which is the old one and was not associated with any statutory filings. For the surrender of current DIN, Form DIR-5 was filed on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) portal on September 4th, 2025, however, as per Section 155 of the Companies Act, 2013 and the remarks received from the ROC, the Managing Director had consequently filed an adjudication application dated September 26, 2025 to surrender the current DIN ‘09159697’. The application is currently under process, and there can be no assurance that the surrender will be approved without further clarifications or conditions from the Authority.

Any delay, rejection, or complication in the surrender process may result in technical defaults in statutory filings, including filings under the Companies Act, 2013, and related rules. Such defaults may adversely affect the Company’s compliance track record, attract regulatory scrutiny, or result in penalties against the Company and the Managing Director. Additionally, any ongoing or unresolved issues in relation to multiple DINs could affect investor perception, create operational or administrative challenges in filing documents with statutory authorities, and may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s reputation, business operations, and financial position.

**19. We operate without executed agreements with certain distributors and manufacturers, which may result into uncertainties in supply, pricing related risks, and potential business disruptions.**

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, the Company has not executed definitive written agreements with certain distributors and/or manufacturing partners, who are engaged in the production, assembly, packaging, warehousing, and/or distribution of our products. These business relationships are currently based on oral understandings, historical commercial dealings, or informal arrangements. Absence of such executed binding contracts exposes the Company to substantial operational and legal risks. Consequently, our ability to enforce contractual obligations, seek specific performance, or claim damages in the event of a breach may be significantly hampered.

Moreover, there is no assurance that such parties will continue their association with the Company on the same terms or at all. If any such partner discontinues its arrangement with us or enters into exclusive arrangements with a competitor, it could result in supply chain disruptions, delay in fulfilment of customer orders, increased procurement costs, or unavailability of certain products in the market. These events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

**20. The Company may experience delays or failures in launching new products. Such issues can affect market competitiveness and revenue growth. Failure to introduce successful products may harm the Company’s business prospects.**

The Company’s ability to grow its revenue, expand market share, and maintain relevance in a competitive and trend-sensitive industry is significantly dependent on the timely development, introduction, and successful market acceptance of new products. These include both licensed character-based merchandise and proprietary branded offerings.

Any delay or failure in conceptualizing, designing, developing, manufacturing, or launching new products whether due to internal constraints such as inadequate product planning, design revisions, supply chain disruptions, quality issues, or due to external dependencies like licensors’ approvals, regulatory requirements, or delayed receipt of prototypes, or marketing assets may adversely affect the Company’s ability to capitalize on prevailing consumer trends or seasonal demand windows (e.g., festive periods, school openings, film releases).

Further, the success of a new product launch is inherently uncertain and depends on multiple factors beyond the Company’s control, including changes in consumer preferences, competitive offerings, economic conditions, and the effectiveness of marketing and distribution strategies. Products based on emerging characters or newly acquired licenses may not achieve the anticipated market traction or acceptance, thereby resulting in underperformance or write-offs.

Failure to timely launch successful products or frequent delays may lead to loss of market opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, erosion of brand equity, inventory accumulation, and adverse financial impact. There can be no assurance that the Company’s future product launches will be timely, cost-effective, or commercially successful.

**21. The Company may face challenges in maintaining and expanding its distribution network. This may impact sales growth and overall business expansion.**

The Company’s business model and revenue generation are significantly dependent on an efficient, scalable, and reliable distribution network spanning domestic and international markets.
