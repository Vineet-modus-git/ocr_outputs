### 3. Incorporation and Investment in a newly proposed wholly owned subsidiary in mainland UAE and funding its working capital requirements.

As part of its international strategy, the Company is structuring its global business into two distinct verticals.

Striders FZ LLC, incorporated in 2018 under the Fujairah Free Zone, currently operates as an offshore trading entity with a B2B focus, managing all global markets outside the Middle East. Built on an order-based model, this entity will remain lean and agile, with its focus on sales execution, product expansion, and scaling proprietary IPs across international markets.

In parallel, the Strider Impex Limited is proposing to incorporate a 100% subsidiary in mainland United Arab Emirates to serve as the regional hub for the Middle East. Unlike the asset-light approach of Striders FZ LLC, this company will operate a direct distribution framework — overseeing sales, marketing, warehousing, fulfillment, and customer engagement with large-format retailers and e-commerce partners.

This strategic expansion will create a physical footprint in the UAE and enhance the company's role in the MENA market. The new proposed entity will serve the MENA market through a direct distribution model.

We propose the Net Proceeds will be allocated towards meeting the working capital requirements of the Company. Considering the working capital-intensive nature of our operations, this deployment will help reduce reliance on external borrowings, improve liquidity, and ensure uninterrupted business operations.

#### Basis of estimation of working capital requirements

The details of the working capital requirements of our Company as at March 31, 2026, and 2027 and the funding pattern for such periods, based on our projected financials, are set out in the table below:
