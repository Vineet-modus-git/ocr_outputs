Moreover, certain agreements may contain provisions for interest or penalties on delayed payments of MG, thereby increasing the Company's financial burden in the event of cash flow constraints or operational delays.

There can be no assurance that our Company will be able to accurately forecast the commercial success of products linked to MG obligations or that such obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity position.

**13. The Company is exposed to China-specific geopolitical risks, including the potential for war-like situations. Such risks may disrupt supply chains, affect market access, and lead to operational uncertainties, thereby adversely impacting the Company's business and financial condition.**

A substantial portion of our operations, particularly with respect to manufacturing relies on third-party partners based in the People's Republic of China (“China”). These include key manufacturing vendors, which play an integral role in the timely procurement, production, and delivery of certain licensed and own-brand products.

Geopolitical tensions between India and China such as military stand-offs, border conflicts, retaliatory trade actions, or deterioration of diplomatic relations pose a significant risk to our operations. In the event of war-like situations, such as armed conflict or prolonged military hostilities between the two nations, we may face sudden and severe disruptions in our supply chain, including:

* Suspension of cross-border trade and shipping routes;

* Imposition of embargoes or import/export restrictions;

* Revocation of business permits or licenses involving Chinese entities;

* Unavailability of manufacturing capacity due to factory closures or resource diversion;

* Breakdown in logistics and customs clearance processes.

Moreover, war-like conditions may also lead to currency volatility, insurance premium hikes, and force majeure claims, which could result in cost escalations, delays in fulfilling customer orders, and cancellation of supply agreements.

Given our current dependency on Chinese partners for manufacturing, any such escalation could materially and adversely affect our business continuity, financial performance, and future expansion plans. While we continue to evaluate alternate sourcing options, the reallocation of production and distribution capabilities may require significant time, investment, and regulatory clearances.

**14. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Variations in currency values may impact the cost of imports, export revenues, and overall financial results. Such exposure could lead to increased volatility in earnings and cash flows.**

A portion of our procurement, manufacturing, and licensing activities is conducted in foreign currencies, particularly in relation to imports of raw materials, procurement of finished goods, payment of royalties under licensing agreements, and services sourced from overseas partners, including those based in China and the Middle East. Consequently, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, especially the U.S. Dollar (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY), and other relevant currencies.

Any adverse movement in exchange rates could result in increased costs of imports or licensing fees, thereby negatively impacting our margins and profitability. While we may enter into hedging arrangements from time to time, such mechanisms may not always be effective or available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, in the absence of a formalized hedging policy, we are vulnerable to currency volatility risks.

In addition, abrupt currency fluctuations may also affect the pricing of our products in the domestic market, making them less competitive compared to locally manufactured alternatives. Our financial results may also be impacted by translation differences for any foreign assets, liabilities, or income.

Accordingly, significant depreciation of the Indian Rupee or volatility in currency markets may materially and adversely affect our business operations, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

**15. The Company relies on third-party warehouse and fulfilment service providers. Any disruptions or inefficiencies in these services may affect inventory management and timely order delivery.**
