## 1. Striders Distribution and Services Private Limited

Striders Distribution and Services Private Limited is the domestic distribution arm of Striders Impex Limited, sourcing its complete product portfolio from Striders Impex. The subsidiary is focused on the B2B distribution of Back-to-School products and School Bags, catering to small and mid-sized retailers across certain parts of northern India.

Its product range includes stationery, accessories, lunch boxes, bottles, and a wide variety of school bags - all of which see steady, predictable demand during the academic season. Operating on a wholesale model, it supplies primarily to mom-and-pop stores, educational supply outlets, and regional retailers, rather than direct-to-consumer channels. This allows the company to effectively serve a fragmented but high-volume market with consistent seasonal demand cycles.

Operations are anchored through a central warehouse in Delhi, which serves as the hub of its distribution network. Warehouse management is outsourced to third party under a commission based arrangement linked to monthly net sales - incentivizing operational efficiency and ensuring smooth inventory handling, order fulfilment, and dispatch.

Following a hub-and-spoke model, the Delhi hub supplies multiple spokes across Punjab, Chandigarh, and other northern states. Timely deliveries and seasonal readiness underpin its logistics value proposition, driving trust and stickiness among retail partners.

## 2. Striders FZ LLC

Striders FZ LLC, incorporated in 2018 under the Fujairah Free Zone, currently operates as an offshore trading entity with a B2B focus. The Company follows an offshore trading model wherein orders are placed with suppliers, primarily in China, and goods are shipped directly to regional distributors, who are the customers of Striders FZ LLC. Under this arrangement, Striders acts as a trading intermediary, facilitating FOB sales from manufacturers to distributors and retailers across international markets. This structure has provided operational simplicity, minimal fixed costs, and an asset-light presence in the UAE, but it also restricts direct access to customers and limits opportunities for brand building in the region.

### Proposed wholly owned subsidiary in mainland UAE

To strengthen the role in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) markets, Striders is in the process of transitioning to a direct distribution model through the establishment of a 100% owned mainland subsidiary in Dubai. The new entity will establish a physical presence in mainland UAE, with warehousing facilities and customer-facing operations such as sales, marketing, and account servicing. While sourcing from China will continue, fulfilment will be managed locally, enabling faster delivery cycles, improved service levels, and stronger engagement with modern retail, e-commerce, and organized trade partners.

Following the transition in its business model, Striders FZ LLC will primarily focus on international markets outside the MENA region, while the proposed 100% owned mainland subsidiary in Dubai will serve the MENA market through a direct distribution model. This strategic shift is expected to unlock multiple benefits for the Group, including:

* **Incremental Turnover Growth** – Direct sales to retailers and omni-channel partners, moving beyond FOB-based trading.
* **Improved Margins** – By eliminating middle distributors, Striders gains greater control over pricing, promotions, and customer relationships.
* **Enhanced Brand Ownership** – Direct distribution allows consistent brand positioning and reduces reliance on third-party distributors.
* **Faster Speed-to-Market** – Local warehousing and fulfilment improve responsiveness, reliability, and competitiveness.
* **Regional Expansion Platform** – The Dubai mainland presence will act as a launchpad for structured expansion into other MENA markets.
