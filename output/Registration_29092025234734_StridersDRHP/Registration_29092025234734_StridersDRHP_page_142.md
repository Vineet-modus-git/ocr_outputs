The popularity of educational toys has been greatly influenced by the development of technology, as well as by changes in academic pressures and parental expectations. A generation of digitally native kids who are at ease with interactive gadgets has been produced by the pervasiveness of technology in daily life. Because of this, toy companies are now creating a variety of tech-enabled educational toys that employ voice recognition, augmented reality (AR), mobile apps, and artificial intelligence to produce interesting and customized learning experiences. These toys can track a child's progress over time, give immediate feedback, and adjust to their learning style. For instance, children can learn the fundamentals of programming and logic through play with coding toys like tablet-connected puzzles and programmable robots. With visual, 3D contents, AR-based books and toys bring subjects like biology and geography to life, improving student engagement and retention. Learning has become more interactive, gamified, and appealing to kids who are naturally drawn to screens and gadgets due to these innovations, which have also helped redefine what education looks like in a play context. These toys are especially appealing to kids and their caregivers because they combine entertainment value with practical learning objectives.

## Growing Influence of Social Media and Online Marketing

The global toy industry has undergone a significant transformation due to the increasing impact of social media and online marketing, which has shaped how products are found, advertised, and bought. To reach and interact with their target audiences—children, parents, and even adult collectors—toy brands now depend heavily on social media sites. These platforms provide a quick, interactive, and visually appealing way to introduce new toys, show off how they operate, and establish a personal bond with customers. Social media marketing gives brands the opportunity to interact directly with consumers through relatable, entertaining, and highly shareable content, in contrast to traditional advertising, which mainly relied on print catalogs and television commercials.

Nowadays, a lot of toy companies actively collaborate with creators to take part in challenges, toy demos, or even comedic skits that feature their products. Because it feels natural and enjoyable rather than obviously commercial, this type of user-generated content is especially powerful. Additionally, the algorithm-based nature of social media helps small, or lesser-known toy brands gain exposure quickly, making the platform a level playing field for both established players and startups. With its powerful visual appeal, Instagram has emerged as a crucial channel for toy promotion, particularly among parents. In keeping with lifestyle branding and careful parenting ideals, influencer parents frequently post visually appealing photos or narratives that highlight educational, wooden, or environmentally friendly toys. Toy manufacturers can position their products as more than just playthings by using carefully chosen content that aligns with a family's identity, values, and children's developmental objectives.

The growing influence of peer recommendations and customer reviews in determining brand perception is another significant change brought about by social media. The consumer journey now includes community discussions, online reviews, and ratings. Many parents look to social media for real user reviews before making a purchase, particularly for more expensive or educational toys. As a result, there are now social media pages, parenting communities, and toy review channels where people can exchange stories and develop trust in specific brands. While negative online reviews can seriously harm a toy's reputation, positive reviews can significantly increase a toy's popularity. As a result, brands now need to be active and responsive on the internet, interacting with consumers, resolving issues, and establishing enduring bonds through community management and social listening.

## Expansion of E-Commerce Platforms

The global toy market has undergone a significant transformation due to the growth of e-commerce platforms, which have revolutionized the way consumers browse, buy, and interact with toys. Customers are moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar toy stores and toward digital platforms as online shopping becomes more convenient and accessible, particularly with the increasing number of smartphones and widespread internet connectivity. Without the geographical and logistical constraints of physical retail, this change has given toy manufacturers, retailers, and even small-scale creators a plethora of opportunities to reach wider, more varied audiences. With their extensive product selection, competitive pricing, quick delivery, and user reviews, online retailers like Amazon, Walmart.com, Alibaba, Flipkart, and local companies like Shopee and Mercado Libre have become the industry leaders in toy retail. Because e-commerce platforms can display thousands of products, unlike traditional stores with limited shelf space, it is easier for customers to find international, customized, or niche toys that may not be available in local stores.

The greater accessibility and convenience that e-commerce provides to parents and gift buyers is among its most noteworthy effects. Customers can compare prices, read product reviews, check safety ratings, and have toys delivered to their doorstep—often the same day or the next day—with just a few clicks. Shopping habits have been significantly altered by this degree of convenience, particularly during busy times like Christmas, birthdays, or back-to-school when availability and time savings are top priorities. Additionally, customers can shop whenever they want, which is particularly helpful for working parents. For those
