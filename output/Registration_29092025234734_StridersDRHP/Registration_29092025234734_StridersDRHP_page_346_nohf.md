d. The BRLM/ the SCSBs will enter each Bid option into the electronic bidding system as a separate Bid and generate a Transaction Registration Slip, ("TRS"), for each price and demand option and give the same to the Bidder. Therefore, a Bidder can receive up to three TRSs for each Bid cum Application Form.

e. Upon receipt of the Bid cum Application Form, submitted whether in physical or electronic mode, the Designated Branch of the SCSB shall verify if sufficient funds equal to the Bid Amount are available in the ASBA Account, as mentioned in the Bid cum Application Form, prior to uploading such Bids with the Stock Exchange.

f. If sufficient funds are not available in the ASBA Account, the Designated Branch of the SCSB shall reject such Bids and shall not upload such Bids with the Stock Exchange.

g. If sufficient funds are available in the ASBA Account, the SCSB shall block an amount equivalent to the Bid Amount mentioned in the Bid cum Application Form and will enter each Bid option into the electronic bidding system as a separate Bid and generate a TRS for each price and demand option. The TRS shall be furnished to the ASBA Bidder on request.

h. The Bid Amount shall remain blocked in the aforesaid ASBA Account until finalization of the Basis of Allotment and consequent transfer of the Bid Amount against the Allotted Equity Shares to the Public Issue Account, or until withdrawal/failure of the Issue or until withdrawal/rejection of the Bid cum Application Form, as the case may be. Once the Basis of Allotment is finalized, the Registrar to the Issue shall send an appropriate request to the SCSB for unblocking the relevant ASBA Accounts and for transferring the amount allocable to the successful Bidders to the Public Issue Account. In case of withdrawal/failure of the Issue, the blocked amount shall be unblocked on receipt of such information from the Registrar to the Issue.

## BIDS AT DIFFERENT PRICE LEVELS AND REVISION OF BIDS

a. Our Company in consultation with the BRLM, and without the prior approval of, or intimation, to the Bidders, reserves the right to revise the Price Band during the Bid/ Issue Period, provided that the Cap Price shall be less than or equal to 120% of the Floor Price and the Floor Price shall not be less than the face value of the Equity Shares. The revision in Price Band shall not exceed 20% on the either side i.e. the floor price can move up or down to the extent of 20% of the floor price disclosed. If the revised price band decided, falls within two different price bands than the minimum application lot size shall be decided based on the price band in which the higher price falls into.

b. Our Company in consultation with the BRLM, will finalize the Issue Price within the Price Band, without the prior approval of, or intimation, to the Bidders.

c. The Bidders can Bid at any price within the Price Band. The Bidder has to Bid for the desired number of Equity Shares at a specific price. Individual Bidders may Bid at the Cut-off Price. However, bidding at the Cut-off Price is prohibited for QIB and Non-Institutional Bidders and such Bids from QIB and Non-Institutional Bidders shall be rejected.

d. Individual Bidders, who Bid at Cut-off Price agree that they shall purchase the Equity Shares at any price within the Price Band. Individual Bidders shall submit the Bid cum Application Form along with a cheque/ demand draft for the Bid Amount based on the Cap Price with the Syndicate. In case of ASBA Bidders (excluding Non-Institutional Bidders and QIB Bidders) bidding at Cut-off Price, the ASBA Bidders shall instruct the SCSBs to block an amount based on the Cap Price.

e. The price of the specified securities offered to an anchor investor shall not be lower than the price offered to other Bidders
