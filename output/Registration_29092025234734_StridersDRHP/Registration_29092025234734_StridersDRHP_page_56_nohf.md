macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, the availability and terms of licensing agreements, fluctuations in input costs, competition intensity, and the ability to effectively manage working capital and operational scalability.

Additionally, the Company's expansion into new geographic markets, development of proprietary brands, reliance on licensed intellectual property, and evolving distribution strategies (including a mix of online and offline channels) present inherent uncertainties and execution risks. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain historical growth rates or maintain historical margins.

We have recently acquired stakes in Striders Distribution and Services Private Limited, to strengthen our presence in domestic markets, and in Striders FZ LLC, to support our global distribution strategy and enhance our footprint in international markets. These acquisitions are recent, and the full integration, operational performance, and expected outcomes remain subject to business, regulatory, and market uncertainties. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve the anticipated synergies, operational efficiencies, or financial benefits.

Accordingly, our historical results of operations and growth trajectory may not serve as a reliable basis for evaluating our future performance. Any inability to adapt to changes in market conditions or to implement our strategic initiatives effectively, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations relating to our operations in India.

**34. Failure to accurately identify customer demand and maintain optimal inventory levels may adversely impact the Company's business operations and financial condition. Inaccurate forecasting could lead to stockouts or excess inventory, affecting sales and profitability.**

Our business depends significantly on our ability to forecast customer demand accurately and maintain an appropriate level of inventory across our product categories, including toys and related merchandise. An inability to anticipate consumer preferences, seasonality, changing market trends, or macroeconomic conditions may result in either excess inventory or stock-outs.

Excess inventory increases our working capital requirements, leads to higher storage costs, and may require us to offer discounts or dispose of slow-moving goods, which could adversely impact our margins. Conversely, understocking or stock-outs could lead to missed sales opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, and reputational harm, especially during peak demand seasons or festival periods.

Our inventory planning is also dependent on lead times for manufacturing and procurement, particularly for imported products or items sourced from third-party vendors. Any disruption in the supply chain, delay in replenishment, or failure to align procurement with sales forecasts could exacerbate inventory imbalances.

If we are unable to effectively manage our inventory in line with customer demand and business cycles, our operations, liquidity position, and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.

**35. We have entered into and expected to enter into related party transactions with our Shareholders, Subsidiaries, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management, for variety of activities and transactions which may potentially involve conflicts of interest.**

For a summary of our related party transactions in the last three Financial Years see “Summary of the Offer Document – Summary of Related Party Transactions” and “Financial Statements – Restated Consolidated Financial Statements” on pages 24 and 215, respectively.
