We have applied for and registered certain logos and trademarks under various classes with the Registrar of Trademarks in India pursuant to the provisions of the Trademarks Act, 1999. As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we hold multiple registered trademarks in India along with certain applications filed for registration that are currently pending. These include our corporate logo "Striders" and brand-related marks such as "Boujee," "Fanster," and "Pugs at Play," which form part of our product portfolio and brand identity. Pending completion of the registration process, our intellectual property remains susceptible to third-party use, and any vendor operating in a similar line of business may attempt to use or imitate such trademarks and designs. In such cases, our ability to seek timely and effective legal recourse may be limited.

In the event that our applications for registration are opposed by third parties or any injunctive or adverse order is passed against us with respect to the trademarks applied for, we may be restricted from using such marks or may be unable to avail full statutory protection. This may adversely affect our ability to prevent unauthorized use, imitation, or misrepresentation of our brand by competitors or other third parties. The registration of intellectual property, particularly trademarks, is often a time-consuming process, and there can be no assurance that our pending or future applications will result in successful registrations.

Failure to secure or adequately protect such intellectual property could undermine the value attached to our brand, goodwill, and proprietary rights, thereby materially impacting our growth prospects, business operations, and financial performance. In particular, the use of similar or deceptively similar trade names by third parties may lead to customer confusion, reduce demand for our products, and enable imitation products to enter the market, thereby adversely affecting our market share and revenues.

Moreover, in the event of unauthorized usage, we may be compelled to initiate legal proceedings for the protection of our intellectual property, which could involve significant costs, prolonged timelines, and diversion of management resources. Even if such litigation is resolved in our favor, the process itself could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results. For these reasons, despite our ongoing efforts to protect our intellectual property portfolio, including trademarks such as "Striders," "Boujee," "Fanster," and "Pugs at Play," we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating, or passing off our trademarks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, and results of operations.

**26. Our overseas operations are dependent on the validity of our trade license, which is due to expire in October 2026, and any failure or delay in its renewal may adversely affect our business.**

Our overseas subsidiary, Striders FZ LLC, has obtained a trade license registered with Creative City Media Free Zone, bearing License No. 13502/2018, issued on August 15, 2024, and valid until October 23, 2026. The continuation of our overseas operations is contingent upon the timely renewal of this license. Any lapse, delay, or non-renewal, whether due to administrative reasons, inadvertence, or changes in regulatory requirements, could disrupt our operations abroad and adversely impact revenue and business continuity. Furthermore, renewal is subject to compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of the Free Zone, and there can be no assurance that the license will be renewed without conditions or additional costs. Such events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects.

**27. Our Subsidiary, Striders FZ LLC, faces significant cash flow mismatches due to extended customer credit periods and supplier advance requirements,**

The Company's subsidiary, Striders FZ LLC, is exposed to significant cash flow mismatches arising from extended credit periods offered to customers and advance payment obligations required by suppliers. Such cash flow constraints could adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its operational, financial, and statutory obligations in a timely manner. Prolonged mismatches may impact the overall liquidity position of the Company and could materially affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**28. Our lease agreement for office space in Fujairah provides no clarity on renewal terms and contains broad inspection and termination rights, creating operational uncertainty and additional liabilities.**

Our Striders FZ LLC has entered into a lease agreement for office premises in Fujairah, valid from May 27, 2025, to October 23, 2026. The lease agreement does not provide certainty regarding renewal terms, and the lessor retains broad rights of inspection and termination. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company is liable for any damage to the office property and facilities and is required to replace such items with equally good or better substitutes, which may result in additional unforeseen expenses. Further, the lessor reserves an unrestricted right to enter and inspect the premises without prior notice to ensure compliance with its rules and regulations, which may cause interruptions in operations or expose the Company to penalties in the event of any alleged non-compliance. The agreement also places restrictions on the storage of belongings, as the Company is not permitted to retain its property at the office desk beyond usage hours, and the lessor disclaims any responsibility for loss of personal belongings, creating logistical challenges and potential risks of loss or damage. In addition, the agreement expressly prohibits certain activities such as retail trading, manufacturing, repacking, and possession of combustible or illegal substances, and any breach or interpretation-related dispute may lead to penalties or termination of the facility. Since the tenure of usage is directly tied to the validity of the Trade Licence, any delay
