NOTE: For category 3(b), calculation methodology shall be similar to above.

**Example B.**

1) Total number of specified securities on offer @ ₹ 600 per share: 1 crore specified securities.

2) Specified securities on offer for non-institutional investors' category: fifteen lakh specified securities.

3) Out of the total non-institutional investors' category,

a) Reserved for applications above two lakhs rupees and up to ten lakhs rupees -i.e., five lakhs of specified securities

b) Balance for applications above ten lakhs rupees - ten lakhs specified securities

4) The issue is overall subscribed by 7 times, whereas the non-institutional investors' category, reserved for applications above two lakh rupees and up to ten lakh rupees -i.e., five lakhs of specified securities is oversubscribed 89.17 times.

5) The issuer has fixed the minimum lot size as 20 specified securities (falling within the range of ten thousand to fifteen thousand rupees) and in multiples thereof.

6) Therefore, the minimum application size for non-institutional investors is 340 specified securities (i.e. the application value should be more than two lakh rupees and in multiples of one lot (i.e. 20 specified securities) thereof.

7) A total of fifty thousand investors have applied in the issue under 3(a) category, in varying number of application sizes i.e. between 17 – 83 lots (340 to 1660 specified securities), based on the maximum application size of up to ten lakh rupees.

8) As per the allotment procedure, the allotment to non-institutional investors shall not be less than the minimum application size, subject to availability of shares.

9) Since the total number of specified securities on offer to the non-institutional investors' applications under 3(a) is 5,00,000 and the minimum application size is 340 specified securities, the maximum number of non-institutional investors who can be allotted this minimum application size should be 1,471. In other words, 1,471 applicants shall get the minimum application size and the remaining 48,529 applicants will not get any allotment.

The details of the allotment shall be as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td>No. of lots</td><td>No. of shares at each lot</td><td>No. of individual investors applying at each lot</td><td>Total no. of shares applied for at each lot</td><td>No. of investors who shall receive lots according to minimum application size (to be selected by a lottery)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D=(B*C)</td><td>E</td></tr></tbody></table>
