These licensing partnerships form a fundamental component of Striders Impex Limited growth strategy, allowing access to widely recognized intellectual properties without incurring the costs of original content creation. Coupled with a robust distribution network and deep product development capabilities, these alliances allow the Company to maximize consumer engagement and market reach

### Key Licenses:

The Company benefits from licensing arrangements with several globally renowned entertainment properties, enabling it to introduce a diverse portfolio of character-based products to the market. These arrangements have helped position Striders Impex Limited as a reliable and compliant licensee within key markets. The availability of well-known IPs under these arrangements allows the Company to offer products that enjoy strong affinity among children and parents alike, while maintaining flexibility in product development and distribution.

### Development of Proprietary IPs:

The Company actively manages a growing portfolio of proprietary brands developed in-house across various toy and consumer product categories. These proprietary brands form an integral part of our strategic positioning and product offerings, particularly in the soft toy, lifestyle, and back-to-school segments.

The Company's IP portfolio includes original brands such as *Pugs at Play*, *Furry Pals*, *Gurliez*, *Minds at Play*, *Beezy Kits*, *Fanster*, *Boujee*, *SHDZ*, and *Striders*. These trademarks are either registered or under application in jurisdictions including India, the United States, China, and the European Union.

These proprietary IPs are core to the Company's long-term growth strategy and complement its licensed brand portfolio. The Company continues to invest in protecting its intellectual property rights through appropriate registrations, renewals, and enforcement actions in applicable jurisdictions.
