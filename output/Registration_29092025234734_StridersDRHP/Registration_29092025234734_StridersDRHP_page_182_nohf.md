# MARKETING & BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

Striders Impex Limited has developed a structured and forward-looking global marketing plan designed to enhance brand visibility, strengthen customer engagement, and drive sustainable growth across domestic and international markets. The Company's marketing strategy is anchored in creating a consistent and impactful brand identity while leveraging both digital and offline channels to maximize reach.

The Company is actively refining its brand positioning to emphasize innovation, quality, and global presence, supported by a cohesive visual identity across platforms. This includes a revamped digital presence through an upgraded website, social media activation, and creation of detailed product assets such as infographics, videos, and catalogues to support online and B2B channels.

On-ground visibility is being enhanced through interactive displays and branded sections in leading retail outlets coupled with targeted in-store activations. Strategic influencer collaborations, product reviews, and digital campaigns are being deployed to create awareness and build trust with key consumer groups, including parents and children.

In addition, Striders Impex Limited is pursuing international expansion opportunities through participation in global trade fairs (e.g., Spielwarenmesse, Hong Kong Toys & Games Fair) and development of B2B portals to facilitate trade partnerships. Retail and e-commerce expansion efforts are further supported through co-branded campaigns, exclusive online bundles, and subscription-based product offerings.

The Company also recognizes the importance of inclusivity and rebranding in addressing global consumer sensitivities. Initiatives such as rethinking product lines (e.g., “Gurliez”) to reflect diverse and inclusive values underscore Striders’ commitment to long-term relevance and market acceptance.

## Regional Marketing Strategies

* **India:** Focus on omnichannel growth through expansion into Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, strengthening presence in modern retail and e-commerce, and creating exclusive retail activations with established partners.

* **Middle East & North Africa (MENA):** Transition to a direct distribution model via its Dubai mainland subsidiary, supported by warehousing, retail tie-ups, and customer-facing functions to strengthen market control and service levels.

Looking ahead, Striders Impex Limited aims to establish itself as a thought leader in the industry by engaging in sustainability-driven initiatives, CSR programs supporting children’s education, and publishing industry insights. Through a combination of digital transformation, strong retail partnerships, and community engagement, the Company seeks to build enduring brand equity and strengthen its competitive positioning across India, MENA, and other international markets.
