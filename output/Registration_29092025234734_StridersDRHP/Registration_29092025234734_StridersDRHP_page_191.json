The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 aim to increase the minimum thickness of plastic carry bags from 40 to 50 microns and stipulate minimum thickness of 50 microns for plastic sheets so as to facilitate the collection and recycle of plastic waste. These rules which were earlier admissible up-to municipal areas have now been extended to all villages so as to cover the rural area also. Because plastic is commonly consumed in villages also. To bring in the responsibilities of producers and generators new concept is introduced. As per new concept, responsibility imposes upon producers/brand owners for the collection of waste plastic and its management. The concept of pre-registration of the producers, importers of plastic carry bags, multi-layered packaging and vendors selling has been introduced so as to collect the plastic waste management fees from them. The new Rules brought in such concepts that will promote activities that comprise the use of plastic waste for road construction, energy recovery, or to manufacture oil from waste. For gainful utilization of waste and also to address the waste disposal issue and to entrust more responsibility on waste generators, concept of payment of user charge has been introduced. These user charges will be prescribed by the local authority and design the mechanism of collection and handing over of waste by the institutional generator and event organizers."}, {"bbox": [135, 738, 847, 767], "category": "Section-header", "text": "# FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND TRADE REGULATIONS"}, {"bbox": [135, 802, 1210, 833], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 and the rules framed thereunder"}, {"bbox": [135, 866, 1564, 1120], "category": "Text", "text": "The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 (FTA), read along with Foreign Trade (Regulation) Rules, 1993, provides for the development and regulation of foreign trade by facilitating imports into, and augmenting exports from, India and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
