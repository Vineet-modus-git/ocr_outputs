Households have more income to spend on non-essential items and services, such as toys and entertainment products for kids, as their income rises after taxes and essential living expenses. In addition to allowing families to spend a greater amount on leisure and play-related products, this economic trend is changing consumer behaviour, market demand, and the competitive environment of the toy industry as a whole. Increased disposable income has an impact on a variety of factors, including retailer strategies, product innovation, consumer preferences, and geographic market expansion."}, {"bbox": [131, 1105, 1571, 1438], "category": "Text", "text": "First and foremost, parents and other caregivers are more likely to spend money on a wider variety of toys, such as high-end, branded, and educational items, when their disposable income increases. The demand for high-quality toys with features that go beyond simple play functions to include developmental, interactive, and tech-enabled aspects is fuelled by this increased spending capacity. For instance, educational toys that encourage STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills have become increasingly popular. This is because parents who can afford them are more likely to choose products that will help their kids grow. Similarly, once-luxury toys that integrate AI, augmented reality, and app-based interaction are becoming more widely available and accessible due to consumer willingness to spend money on enhanced play experiences. To accommodate these changing preferences, toy companies are investing increasingly in innovation, research, and design, which is driving a trend in the industry toward smarter, more advanced products."}, {"bbox": [131, 1460, 1571, 1757], "category": "Text", "text": "Additionally, increasing disposable income raises the average transaction size per customer and promotes more frequent toy purchases. Toys are not just used as birthday or holiday presents in higher-income households; they are also utilized as daily incentives, educational resources, and opportunities for family bonding. By extending the toy industry's customary seasonal sales cycle, this practice helps to stabilize revenues all year long and lessen reliance on the busiest holiday seasons. Families with more disposable income are also more likely to buy entertainment franchise-related themed products, like action figures, dolls, or board games based on well-known movies and TV shows. Licensing agreements between toy companies and entertainment studios therefore become more lucrative and vital in capturing the spending power of consumers who are both emotionally and financially invested in such properties."}, {"bbox": [131, 1780, 1571, 2110], "category": "Text", "text": "Geographically, the global toy market is expanding significantly due to rising disposable income in emerging economies. The demand for consumer goods, including toys, has increased exponentially in Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa as a result of economic development, urbanization, and the growth of the middle class. Millions of families in nations like China and India have risen into income brackets that allow them the luxury of discretionary spending, allowing them to follow globally consumer trends. International toy companies eager to enter these untapped sectors now have new opportunities due to this phenomenon. Local players, in turn, have responded by scaling up production, improving product quality, and adopting international safety and design standards to compete effectively. Moreover, the proliferation of e-commerce platforms in these regions, combined with the increase in disposable income, has further facilitated consumer access to a wide array of toys from both domestic and international sources."}]
