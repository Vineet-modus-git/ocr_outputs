The need for toys that promote healthy growth has increased as parents, educators, and legislators become more conscious of the critical impact that early play has on a child's cognitive, emotional, and physical development. This change reflects a wider cultural recognition that play is not only a recreational activity but also a vital component of early education, with toys acting as instruments to support children's world exploration, socialization, confidence-building, and academic success. Because of this, toy manufacturers are now giving developmental value top priority when designing toys, producing toys that foster creativity, problem-solving, fine motor skills, and language development. Toys like building blocks, puzzles, interactive storybooks, and role-playing sets, for instance, are purposefully made to support particular developmental milestones at various phases of childhood, from infancy to adolescence."}, {"bbox": [131, 695, 1571, 844], "category": "Text", "text": "Furthermore, sustainability and eco-consciousness are increasingly being connected to the development and safety of children.

Because toys are primarily made for children, who are a very delicate and vulnerable group, governments everywhere have imposed stringent safety regulations to guarantee that these items are free from mechanical, chemical, and physical risks. Toy manufacturers must comply with these complicated legal and logistical requirements, even though they are crucial for ensuring the health and safety of children. Toys must adhere to intricate and ever-changing safety regulations in developed regions such as North America and Europe. For example, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) in the United States requires toys to adhere to certain standards, such as mandatory labelling, third-party lab testing, and limits on lead and phthalates. Manufacturers in the EU are required to adhere to the EN 71 series of toy safety regulations in order to apply the CE mark, which certifies that the product has undergone thorough safety testing. Manufacturers who sell internationally must negotiate a complicated web of region-"}]
