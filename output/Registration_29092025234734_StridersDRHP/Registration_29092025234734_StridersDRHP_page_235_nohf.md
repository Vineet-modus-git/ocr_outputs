(Amounts in ₹ Lakhs)

## Note B: Summary Of Material Accounting Policies

### 9. Employee Benefits:

**Defined Benefit Plan (Gratuity)** The Company's obligations towards defined benefit plans and other long-term employee benefits, are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method which is suggested under Accounting Standard 15 (Revised 2005). The valuation of the gratuity liability is carried out by a Registered Valuer. Based on the valuation, the gratuity liability has been classified into current and non-current components.

### 10. Borrowing Cost:

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset (one that requires a substantial period to prepare for its intended use or sale) are capitalized as part of that asset until it is substantially ready for its intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognized as interest expense in the period incurred.

### 11. Leases:

Operating leases, where the lessor retains substantially all ownership risks and rewards, are recognized as such. Lease rentals are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the lease term, per the lease agreement.

### 12. Impairment of Assets:

The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at each Balance Sheet date are reviewed for impairment. If any Indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated and Impairment is recognized, If the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flow to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor. When there is Indication that an Impairment loss recognized for an asset (other than a revalued asset) in earlier accounting periods no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. In case of revalued assets such reversal is not recognized.

### 13. Investments:

Investments, which are readily realizable and intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made, are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as long-term investments. On initial recognition, all investments are measured at cost. The cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable acquisition charges such as brokerage, fees and duties. On disposal of an investment, the difference between its carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss.

### 14. Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:

Provision involving substantial degree of estimation in measurement are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. Contingent Liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed in the notes. Contingent Assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.

### 15. Segment Accounting

#### Business Segment

The business segment has been considered as the primary segment. The Company's primary business segments are reflected based on principal business activities in relation to licensing global toy brands for the Indian market, supported by a multi-channel distribution network and developing its own IPs in toys and consumer products. This is the only segment as envisaged in Accounting Standard 17: 'Segment Reporting' therefore disclosure for Segment reporting is not applicable.

#### Geographical Segment

As the company operates in India only, hence, geographical segment reporting is not applicable.

### 16. Cash Flow Statement

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated accordingly.

### 17. Other Accounting Policies:

Other Accounting Policies are consistent with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in India.
