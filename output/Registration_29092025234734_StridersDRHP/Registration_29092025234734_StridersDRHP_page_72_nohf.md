* Complex Regulatory Compliance: Varying standards with respect to corporate governance, product safety, import-export restrictions, foreign investment rules, employment laws, and data protection regulations may increase our legal exposure and administrative burden.
* Taxation Risks: We are subject to local corporate taxes, withholding taxes, indirect taxes (such as VAT or GST), and transfer pricing regulations across different territories. Any changes in tax laws, inconsistent application by authorities, or adverse interpretations could result in increased tax liabilities, penalties, or litigation.
* Legal Interpretation and Enforcement Challenges: Certain jurisdictions may have less predictable or opaque enforcement mechanisms, thereby increasing uncertainty in contractual enforcement, dispute resolution, and regulatory approvals.
* Risk of Double Taxation: Inadequate or delayed implementation of double taxation avoidance treaties (DTAA) or improper inter-company transaction documentation may expose us to taxation in more than one jurisdiction for the same income.
* Foreign Exchange and Repatriation Restrictions: Jurisdictions may impose restrictions on repatriation of profits or dividends, sudden changes in foreign exchange control norms, or limitations on royalty/license fee remittances.

Any non-compliance, misinterpretation, or delay in adapting to the evolving legal and fiscal landscapes in these jurisdictions may lead to regulatory scrutiny, penalties, business interruptions, or reputational harm. These risks may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operational performance, and strategic flexibility.

## 77. The condition and reliability of India's infrastructure may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition

India's physical infrastructure, including transportation, power, and communication systems, remains in a developing phase compared to several advanced economies. Any congestion, inefficiency, or disruption in ports, railways, road networks, electricity supply, communication systems, or other public facilities could materially disrupt the Company's regular business operations. Deterioration or inadequacies in India's infrastructure could increase costs of doing business, delay transportation of raw materials and finished goods, and adversely affect supply chain efficiency.

Such challenges may result in interruptions to the Company's operations, higher operational expenses, and reduced competitiveness, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and overall financial condition.

## 78. Risks arising from financial difficulties in Indian lending and investment institutions

The Indian financial system is exposed to vulnerabilities that may arise from financial difficulties in long-term lending institutions and investment institutions. The commercial soundness of many institutions is closely interconnected due to credit, trading, clearing, and other business relationships. As a result, financial stress in one institution can trigger a cascading impact on others, a risk commonly referred to as "systemic risk."

Systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies, banks, securities firms, and exchanges. Transactions with such entities involve counterparty credit risk, particularly in the event of default or instability, which can be further amplified during periods of market illiquidity or economic volatility.

As an emerging market, the Indian financial system is subject to risks not typically encountered in developed economies. These may include deposit runs, liquidity shortages, and volatility in capital markets, notwithstanding the presence of regulatory frameworks and deposit insurance schemes.

Financial difficulties at individual institutions or instability in the financial system more broadly could create negative market perceptions about Indian financial institutions and banks. Such developments may impact credit availability, investor confidence, financial stability, and the overall economic environment.

## 79. The Company is exposed to risks arising from the adverse application or interpretation of competition laws in India. Regulatory actions or penalties resulting from such risks may impact business operations, restrict market practices, and affect financial performance

Our operations are subject to the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002, and any other applicable antitrust or competition laws and regulations in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is empowered to investigate and take action against enterprises that are alleged to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, including abuse of dominant position, anti-competitive agreements, or combinations having an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India.

Given the nature of our business involving licensing arrangements, exclusive/non-exclusive distribution rights, and contractual commitments with licensors and distributors, there is a possibility that such arrangements may, at any time, be subject to scrutiny by
