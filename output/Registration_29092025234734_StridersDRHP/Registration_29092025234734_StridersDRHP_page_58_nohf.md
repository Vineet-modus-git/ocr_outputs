mandatory excess and other limitations, and there is no assurance that claims, if any, will be honoured or settled in a timely manner by insurers.

We may also be subject to uninsured risks either due to exclusions, failure to obtain specific coverage, delays in policy renewals, or disputes over policy interpretation. Any uninsured or underinsured loss, liability, or damage could result in significant costs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

**38. The Company is exposed to demand volatility. Fluctuations in customer demand can impact sales consistency and inventory management. Such variability may affect revenue stability and operational planning.**

Our Company operates in the consumer products industry, with a primary focus on kids merchandise segments that are inherently susceptible to fluctuations in consumer demand due to changing preferences, evolving trends, macroeconomic conditions, seasonality, and external events.

The demand for our products, particularly those tied to licensed intellectual properties, is often driven by the popularity of specific characters, media content, or entertainment franchises, which can change unpredictably. Moreover, products such as toys, school supplies, and novelties experience seasonal demand cycles, with peaks typically occurring during school re-openings, holidays, and festive periods. Off-season periods may witness significantly lower sales volumes.

Additionally, factors such as:

* Reduced discretionary spending by consumers;

* Adverse economic or geopolitical developments;

* Regulatory changes in key markets;

* Entry of new competitors or alternative product categories;

can contribute to short-term or prolonged demand contractions, making accurate inventory planning and forecasting challenging. A sudden or sustained decline in demand for any product category or licensed property may result in inventory overhang, revenue shortfall, margin compression, and working capital stress. We cannot assure that future demand patterns will align with historical trends, or that our Company will be able to adapt its sourcing, marketing, and sales strategies quickly to mitigate such demand volatility. Failure to effectively respond to such fluctuations may materially and adversely impact our business operations, profitability, and overall financial condition.

**39. Our Company has availed unsecured loans which are repayable on demand. Any demand from lender(s) for repayment of such unsecured loans, may adversely affect our cash flows.**
