Examples include spinning tops, wooden blocks, dolls, marbles, and jump ropes. These toys encourage imaginative play, physical activity, and social interaction among children, often requiring minimal supervision or batteries. They also hold cultural significance, reflecting the customs and heritage of different regions through unique designs and craftsmanship. Traditional toys promote sensory development and fine motor skills by engaging children in hands-on activities.
