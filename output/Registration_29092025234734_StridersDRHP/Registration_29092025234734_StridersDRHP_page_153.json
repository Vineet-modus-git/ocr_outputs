These toys focus on creativity, learning, and fun, allowing all children to explore a wide range of interests without feeling limited by societal expectations. Examples include building blocks, puzzles, art supplies, and interactive games that encourage problem-solving, imagination, and collaboration. Gender-neutral toys help foster open-mindedness and respect among children by emphasizing shared play experiences rather than dividing activities by gender. They also support the development of diverse skills, from critical thinking to social interaction, in an environment that values individuality. By offering toys that can be enjoyed by anyone, manufacturers and parents encourage children to follow their natural curiosities and talents freely. Ultimately, unisex toys contribute to a more inclusive play culture where every child feels empowered to learn, create, and grow without the constraints of traditional gender roles."}, {"bbox": [412, 646, 1289, 684], "category": "Caption", "text": "### GLOBAL TOYS MARKET, BY END USER, 2019-2035 (USD BILLION)"}, {"bbox": [142, 711, 1573, 962], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><th>End User</th><th>2019-h</th><th>2020-h</th><th>2021-h</th><th>2022-h</th><th>2024-b</th><th>2035-p</th><th>CAGR (2025-2035)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Boys</th><td>32.113</td><td>22.405</td><td>26.531</td><td>32.934</td><td>36.534</td><td>68.328</td><td>6.01%</td></tr><tr><th>Girls</th><td>29.119</td><td>20.420</td><td>24.306</td><td>30.329</td><td>33.987</td><td>67.489</td><td>6.59%</td></tr><tr><th>Unisex Gender-Neutral Toys</th><td>34.887</td><td>24.598</td><td>29.438</td><td>36.931</td><td>41.819</td><td>87.920</td><td>7.15%</td></tr><tr><th>Total</th><td>96.118</td><td>67.423</td><td>80.275</td><td>100.193</td><td>112.340</td><td>223.736</td><td>6.62%</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [132, 968, 624, 1002], "category": "Text", "text": "h: Historic, b: Base, p: Predicted/forecasted"}, {"bbox": [142, 1006, 1391, 1035], "category": "Caption", "text": "### GLOBAL TOYS MARKET REVENUE SHARE, BY END USER, 2024 (% SHARE)"}, {"bbox": [303, 1077, 1573, 1347], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [132, 1374, 646, 1410], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: Global Toys Market Research Report"}, {"bbox": [132, 1433, 515, 1468], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Global Toys Market, By Region"}, {"bbox": [132, 1481, 712, 1515], "category": "Text", "text": "Based on region, the toys market is segmented into:"}, {"bbox": [132, 1518, 390, 1699], "category": "List-item", "text": "* North America\n* Europe\n* Asia Pacific\n* South America\n* Middle East & Africa"}, {"bbox": [394, 1739, 1307, 1774], "category": "Caption", "text": "### GLOBAL TOYS MARKET, BY REGION, 2019-2035 (UNITS IN BILLION)"}, {"bbox": [134, 1779, 1571, 2159], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><th>Region</th><th>2019-h</th><th>2020-h</th><th>2021-h</th><th>2022-h</th><th>2024-b</th><th>2035-p</th><th>CAGR (2025-2035)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>North America</th><td>0.9846</td><td>0.6847</td><td>0.8082</td><td>1.0000</td><td>1.1023</td><td>1.9905</td><td>5.68%</td></tr><tr><th>Europe</th><td>1.1167</td><td>0.7795</td><td>0.9237</td><td>1.1474</td><td>1.2739</td><td>2.4106</td><td>6.13%</td></tr><tr><th>Asia Pacific</th><td>1.2613</td><td>0.8921</td><td>1.0707</td><td>1.3471</td><td>1.5364</td><td>3.3049</td><td>7.37%</td></tr><tr><th>South America</th><td>0.1469</td><td>0.1017</td><td>0.1195</td><td>0.1471</td><td>0.1607</td><td>0.2738</td><td>5.12%</td></tr><tr><th>Middle East & Africa</th><td>0.1031</td><td>0.0711</td><td>0.0832</td><td>0.1021</td><td>0.1074</td><td>0.1725</td><td>4.38%</td></tr><tr><th>Total</th><td>3.6127</td><td>2.5292</td><td>3.0053</td><td>3.7436</td><td>4.1807</td><td>8.1522</td><td>6.42%</td></tr></tbody></table>"}]
