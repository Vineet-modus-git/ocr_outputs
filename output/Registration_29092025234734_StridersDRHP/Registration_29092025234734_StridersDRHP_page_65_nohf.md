There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends in the future, or that the amount of any such dividends will not be reduced or eliminated. Further, any declaration and payment of dividends will be subject to the terms of our financing arrangements, if any, and other contractual or statutory obligations that we may be bound by at the relevant time. As a result, investors may not receive any return on their investment in the Equity Shares by way of dividends, and any return on investment may be limited to the appreciation, if any, in the market price of the Equity Shares.

**56. The Company faces the risk of allergic reactions caused by the use of its products. Such incidents may lead to consumer harm, product liability claims, regulatory sanctions, and reputational damage.**

Certain toys and consumer products distributed or sold by our Company may contain materials, dyes, plastics, coatings, or additives that, while generally recognized as safe and compliant with applicable regulatory standards, may in rare instances cause allergic reactions or sensitivities in end users, particularly children.

Although we take utmost care in sourcing, testing, and quality control, including compliance with safety norms under applicable Indian and international standards, we cannot assure that all products will be free from components that may trigger allergic reactions in all consumers.

Any such incidents whether isolated or systemic could result in product recalls, negative publicity, legal claims (including under consumer protection or product liability laws), or regulatory actions. These could materially and adversely affect our brand reputation, customer trust, and financial performance. Further, any increase in consumer awareness or regulatory scrutiny regarding allergens in children's products may require us to invest in additional disclosures, labelling changes, or reformulation of products.

**57. The Company faces risks related to non-adherence to labelling and product norms in foreign markets. Failure to comply with these norms and regulations may result in penalties, product recalls, and restricted market access.**

We currently distribute and may in the future expand the distribution of our products in international markets, including jurisdictions with distinct and stringent product labelling, safety, and quality standards. Each country or region may impose specific requirements relating to the display of product information, age suitability, health and safety warnings, country of origin declarations, language and format of instructions, and materials or ingredients used.

There exists a risk that our products, or the labelling and packaging thereof, may inadvertently fail to comply with such jurisdiction-specific regulatory frameworks. Any such non-adherence whether due to differences in interpretation, lack of awareness, or inadvertent error could subject our Company to penalties, fines, product recalls, bans on sale, destruction of goods at customs, or civil litigation initiated by regulatory authorities or affected consumers.

Furthermore, certain foreign regulations are frequently updated or subject to stricter enforcement. Our failure to stay current with such regulatory developments or implement corresponding internal compliance mechanisms may adversely impact our ability to expand into or operate in key international markets.

In addition, any adverse publicity or enforcement action stemming from non-compliance may materially harm our brand reputation and relationships with licensors, customers, and partners in such markets. While we strive to maintain compliance through product testing, legal due diligence, and third-party certifications, we cannot assure that inadvertent lapses will not occur in the future.

**58. The Company is exposed to risks arising from piracy and counterfeit products in the market. Such activities may erode brand value, reduce sales, and expose the Company to legal liabilities.**

The toy and consumer goods industry is particularly vulnerable to the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated products, especially in markets where enforcement of intellectual property rights is weak or inconsistent. Given that a significant portion of our business involves the distribution and sale of licensed products based on popular characters and brands we are exposed to the risk of unauthorized third-party imitation and sale of lookalike or infringing products. Counterfeit products not only infringe upon our licensing and intellectual property rights but also often fail to meet regulatory standards of safety, quality, and labelling, thereby posing reputational risks to the Company and to our licensors. These counterfeit goods may be distributed through offline retail, grey markets, or unauthorized online platforms, and are often sold at lower prices, eroding our market share and pricing power.

Although we and our licensors actively monitor for infringement and may pursue legal recourse in certain instances, the identification, enforcement, and prosecution of such violations are resource-intensive and may not yield timely or effective outcomes.
