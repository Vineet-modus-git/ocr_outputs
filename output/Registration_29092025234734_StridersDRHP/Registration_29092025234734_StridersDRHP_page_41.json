These third-party arrangements form a critical part of our supply chain and operational model, enabling scalability, cost efficiency, and timely market entry. However, reliance on external manufacturers exposes us to risks such as production disruptions, delays in delivery, quality control issues, non-compliance with contractual obligations, and dependence on their financial and operational stability. While our contractual arrangements with Indian manufacturers are formalized through executed agreements, our oversight over their day-to-day operations, procurement practices, labour compliance, inventory management, and adherence to quality and regulatory standards remains inherently limited. Any lapses or deficiencies on their part, whether due to negligence, non-compliance, or capacity constraints, could lead to product quality issues, supply delays, increased costs, or even regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Further, our contractual arrangements with such manufacturers are generally subject to periodic renewals, revisions, and renegotiations, and any inability to maintain these arrangements on favourable terms, or at all, may materially and adversely affect our operations, product availability, financial condition, and overall business performance."}, {"bbox": [101, 807, 1568, 878], "category": "List-item", "text": "**8.
