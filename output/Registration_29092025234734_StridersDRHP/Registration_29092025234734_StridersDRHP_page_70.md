* Political instability, regional conflicts, or civil unrest;
* Deterioration in fiscal position or increase in public debt levels;
* Regulatory or policy changes that could impact business or industry standards;
* Natural calamities, pandemics, or other force majeure events;
* Weakness in capital markets or reduced consumer and investor confidence.

These factors, individually or in combination, may materially affect our ability to grow, maintain profitability, or access capital, and could lead to lower revenues, increased costs, or other financial or operational challenges.

**72. Potential adverse impact of geopolitical and regulatory risks in foreign markets.** Political instability, changes in laws, and regulatory uncertainties may disrupt operations, increase compliance costs, and adversely impact business performance and expansion plans.

Our Company along with its overseas subsidiaries i.e. Striders FZ LLC, distributes to, multiple international jurisdictions, including but not limited to UAE, Europe (including Germany, Denmark, London), through export channels. Accordingly, we are exposed to a range of geopolitical uncertainties and regulatory environments, which may vary significantly across countries.

Tensions between India and other nations, particularly China, where some of our manufacturing partners and key distributors are located, could result in trade restrictions, delays in supply chains, or cancellation of import/export agreements, adversely impacting our ability to procure, manufacture, or distribute our products in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Furthermore, changes in foreign laws, including import duties, labelling and safety requirements, environmental regulations, licensing requirements, data protection laws, and e-commerce norms may impose compliance burdens and legal exposure on our Company. In some jurisdictions, we may also be exposed to currency controls, restrictions on repatriation of funds, or differential treatment of foreign-owned businesses.

Any escalation in geopolitical conflicts, including economic sanctions, armed conflicts, civil unrest, or political instability in regions we operate in or source from, may adversely impact our supply chain, contractual arrangements, and revenue streams, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.

**73. Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, and economic growth, may significantly influence consumer demand for the Company's products.** Adverse economic trends could reduce purchasing power and negatively affect sales, revenue, and overall financial performance.

Our business is inherently sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that influence consumer purchasing power, sentiment, and discretionary spending. Factors such as inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, currency volatility, unemployment levels, GDP growth fluctuations, and overall economic slowdown both in India and in the international markets we operate can significantly impact consumer behaviour and demand for toys and licensed merchandise.

In particular, toys and character-based licensed products are considered discretionary purchases, and a reduction in disposable income or an economic downturn may lead to a decline in retail sales, reduced footfall in physical outlets, and lower order volumes from our B2B and distribution partners. macroeconomic volatility can lead to reduced demand across e-commerce platforms and quick-commerce channels, as consumers prioritize essential over non-essential items. A sustained or sudden deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in any of our key markets, including India, UAE, and Europe, may adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, and profitability. Such effects could also lead to inventory build-up, delayed receivables, reduced pricing power, and even cancellation or postponement of new product launches, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition.

**74. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in raw material prices and potential supply chain disruptions.** Volatility in input costs or interruptions in supply may increase production expenses, affect inventory availability, and impact overall profitability and operational efficiency.

Our business operations and profitability are significantly dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials used in the manufacturing of toys and related consumer products. Volatility in raw material prices such as plastics, packaging materials, and other components can adversely affect our cost structures. These price fluctuations may be driven by global commodity cycles,
