These days, educational toys—which combine play and learning—are seen as vital components of a child's development rather than simply extra or optional items. Through entertaining and engaging activities, these toys seek to develop children's motor, social, emotional, and cognitive abilities. The way parents view play has changed significantly over the past ten years. More than ever, they are actively looking for toys that provide both fun and significant educational value because they intend to prepare their kids for a world that is becoming more competitive and changing quickly. This change has its roots in contemporary parenting theories that prioritize experiential learning and holistic growth. Today's parents want toys that support language development, problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creativity, and early literacy and numeracy rather than just providing entertainment for their kids. Because of this, toys that teach STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills—like puzzles, building kits, coding robots, and electronic learning tools—have become increasingly popular in both developed and emerging markets."}, {"bbox": [130, 1640, 1571, 2087], "category": "Text", "text": "The increasing amount of scientific research emphasizing the value of early childhood learning is one of the main causes of the popularity of educational toys. The first five years of life are when the brain is most responsive to learning, according to developmental psychology studies. Since children learn best during this time through play-based experiences, educational toys are a perfect way to capture their interest and improve learning results. By presenting basic ideas in an approachable and developmentally appropriate way, educational toys help close the gap between structured classroom instruction and unstructured play. For instance, early literacy and numeracy skills are introduced through number games, alphabet blocks, and shape sorters. More advanced educational toys, such as interactive globe maps, programmable robots, or chemistry sets, are aimed at older kids and are meant to stimulate their curiosity about science and problem-solving. In an era where academic standards are rising globally, parents understand that these toys can give their kids a developmental head start. The importance of educational toys and games in mainstream learning environments has been further justified by governments and educational institutions around the world, who have included them in preschool and elementary school curricula in response to the growing emphasis on early learning."}]
