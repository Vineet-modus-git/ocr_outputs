FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Draft Red Herring Prospectus contains certain statements which are not statements of historical fact and may be described as "forward-looking statements". These forward-looking statements include statements which can generally be identified by words or phrases such as "aim", "anticipate", "are likely", "believe", "continue", "can", "could", "expect", "estimate", "intend", "may", "likely", "objective", "plan", "propose", "will continue", "seek to", "will achieve", "will likely", "will pursue" or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe the strategies, objectives, plans or goals of our Company are also forward-looking statements. All statements regarding our expected financial conditions, results of operations, business plans and prospects are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements as to our business strategy, plans, revenue and profitability (including, without limitation, any financial or operating projections or forecasts) and other matters discussed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus that are not historical facts. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans, estimates and expectations and actual results may differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, expectations and assumptions about us that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward-looking statement.

Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements due to risks or uncertainties associated with our expectations with respect to, but not limited to, regulatory changes pertaining to the industry in which our Company operates and our ability to respond to them, our ability to successfully implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general economic and political conditions in India and globally which have an impact on our business activities, investments, or the industry in which we operate, the monetary and fiscal policies of India, inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices or other rates or prices, the performance of the financial markets in India and globally, changes in domestic laws, regulations and taxes, changes in competition in the industry in which we operate and incidents of any natural calamities and/or acts of violence. Certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our Company's expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. The COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or widespread public health emergency could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
2. General economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the local, regional, national and international economies;
3. Changes in laws and regulations relating to the sectors/areas in which we operate;
4. Increased competition in industry which we operate;
5. Factors affecting the industry in which we operate;
6. Fluctuations in operating costs;
7. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
8. Political instability or changes in the Government could adversely affect economic conditions in India and consequently our business may get affected to some extent.
9. Changes in political and social conditions in India, the monetary and interest rate policies of India and other countries;
10. Inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, equity prices or other rates or prices;
11. The performance of the financial markets in India and globally;
12. Any adverse outcome in the legal proceedings in which we are involved;
13. Our failure to keep pace with rapid changes in technology;
14. The occurrence of natural disasters or calamities;
15. Other factors beyond our control;
16. Our ability to manage risks that arise from these factors; and
17. Changes in government policies and regulatory actions that apply to or affect our business

For further discussion on factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations, see "Risk Factors", "Our Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" beginning on pages 32, 153, 220. By their nature, certain market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. As a result, actual gains or losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated. There can be no assurance to investors that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Given these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements and not to regard such statements to be a guarantee of our future performance.
