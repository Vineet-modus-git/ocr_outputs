**48. E-commerce websites and quick-commerce platforms face distinct risks, including technological disruptions, cybersecurity threats, and changing consumer behaviour. Operational challenges such as delivery logistics and platform reliability may also impact performance.**

While we have established a presence on e-commerce and quick-commerce platforms to complement our overall retail strategy, we do not consider these channels as substitutes for our core distribution-driven business model, which continues to be the primary driver of our revenue and market penetration.

E-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, and quick-commerce applications like Blinkit or Zepto cater to a different consumer segment, with logistical, pricing, and operational models that are significantly distinct from traditional wholesale and retail distribution networks. These digital platforms are often focused on limited product lines, serve primarily urban or metro consumers, and operate on thin margins and stringent fulfilment timelines, which may not be commercially viable for the entire breadth of our product portfolio.

Moreover, unlike our physical distribution channels which provide deep market access, brand visibility across tier-II and tier-III cities, and long-standing relationships with retailers and distributors - e-commerce platforms do not offer equivalent scalability or brand control. Our distribution network also facilitates physical product placement, localized inventory planning, and retailer push strategies that cannot be effectively replicated through digital-only models.

Further, we face limited influence over platform-specific algorithmic rankings, promotional visibility, and pricing controls, all of which impact our sales performance on e-commerce. Given these constraints, coupled with heightened platform compliance obligations and evolving regulatory scrutiny on digital commerce.

Therefore, any over-reliance or undue expectations placed on e-commerce as a growth driver may not be aligned with our business fundamentals. Our sustained growth continues to be dependent on strengthening and expanding our distribution footprint, particularly across underpenetrated regions of India where digital penetration remains limited.

**49. The Company is exposed to risks arising from product returns and order cancellations. High rates of returns or cancellations may increase operational costs, reduce revenue, and impact inventory management.**

The Company is exposed to risks arising from product returns and order cancellations. High rates of returns or cancellations may increase operational costs, reduce revenue, and affect inventory management.

While our products are sold through multiple channels, a significant portion of sales occurs offline through distributors. Nevertheless, our operations, particularly in the toys and consumer products segment, remain susceptible to returns and cancellations across all channels, including e-commerce platforms, quick-commerce applications, and Cash-on-Delivery (COD) orders. Returns or cancellations may occur due to factors such as damaged goods, delayed shipments, customer dissatisfaction, change of preference, or product mismatches.

In the case of prepaid orders, cancellations may require refunds that are operationally and financially burdensome, especially when processed through third-party payment aggregators. For COD orders, refused deliveries result in logistics losses, additional warehousing costs, and often unrecoverable expenses. Returns or disputes with distributors may also lead to operational inefficiencies and affect inventory turnover.

The absence of a uniform returns policy across platforms, geographies, and distribution networks may result in policy disputes, consumer complaints, or penalties from marketplaces. Frequent cancellations or returns, whether through online or offline channels, affect the Company's ability to accurately forecast demand, manage inventory, and maintain customer service standards.

A sustained increase in returns and cancellations could result in margin erosion, strain on working capital, and adverse effects on reputation and consumer trust, which may materially and adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**50. The Company is exposed to risks arising from dependence on specific sales channels, such as online or offline platforms. Overreliance on any single channel may limit market reach and increase vulnerability to channel-specific disruptions. This concentration risk could adversely affect revenue stability and growth prospects.**

The Company distributes and sells its products through a combination of online platforms and offline retail channels. A material concentration of sales through any particular distribution channel, whether online marketplaces (such as Amazon, Flipkart, FirstCry, etc.) or offline distribution networks, may expose the Company to channel-specific risks, including but not limited to: changes in platform policies, commission structures, fulfilment fees, or disruptions in logistics and warehousing infrastructure.
