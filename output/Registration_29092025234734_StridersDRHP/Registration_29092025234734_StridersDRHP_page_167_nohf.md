# KEY STRENGTHS OF OUR BUSINESS

Striders Impex Limited has established a resilient and scalable business model that is strategically designed to capture long-term value in the global toy and consumer products industry. The Company's advantages are rooted in its asset-light operational framework, global brand partnerships, and forward-looking market approach

## 1. Asset-Light Business Model

Striders Impex Limited operates through an asset-light, licensing-led and distribution-focused model that enables efficient capital deployment, rapid scalability, and prudent regulatory compliance. By avoiding capital-intensive manufacturing infrastructure and instead partnering with third-party vendors across geographies, the Company minimizes fixed overheads while maintaining flexibility in its operations. This structure allows Striders Impex Limited to scale product offerings swiftly in response to market demand, enhance operating margins, and uphold high standards of compliance with environmental, labour, and industrial laws. The model not only supports a robust and agile supply chain but also ensures transparency and risk mitigation, aligning with both investor expectations and regulatory frameworks.

## 2. Trusted Licensing Partnerships with Global Brands

Striders Impex Limited has forged strong relationships with globally renowned licensors, enabling the Company to develop and distribute a wide portfolio of character-driven and brand-affiliated products. These partnerships enhance product appeal, drive consumer engagement, and allow the Company to leverage existing brand equity without incurring the costs and timelines of content creation. From an operational standpoint, these alliances support faster product development cycles, improved market penetration, and shelf prominence across diverse retail formats. The Company adheres to all licensing terms, brand usage protocols, and regulatory requirements, reinforcing its standing as a compliant and dependable partner. This strategic reliance on established IPs contributes to a scalable and resilient business model with improved visibility into revenue streams and consumer demand.

## 3. Strong Brand Equity and Consumer Affinity

Striders Impex Limited has built a strong brand identity and consumer recall through a combination of licensed character products and a growing portfolio of proprietary intellectual properties. Brands such as *Pugs at Play*, *Furry Pals*, *Gurliez*, *Minds at Play*, *Boujees*, *Beezy Kits*, *Fanster*, *SHDZ*, and *Striders* reflect the Company's commitment to creating novel product lines tailored to diverse age groups and lifestyle preferences. These IPs, developed in-house based on market insights and consumer trends, have strengthened customer loyalty and differentiated the Company in a competitive retail environment. The dual approach of combining globally recognized licenses with homegrown brands enhances brand equity, supports pricing power, and deepens market penetration across both domestic and international geographies. This consumer-focused branding strategy contributes to a sustainable competitive advantage and long-term growth trajectory.

## 4. Strategic Presence in High-Growth Markets

Striders Impex Limited has acquired a wholly owned subsidiary, Striders FZ LLC, to expand into international markets. This initiative strengthens the Company's global footprint, diversifies its revenue streams, and positions it to capture opportunities in high-growth regions. The overseas presence enhances distribution reach, improves brand visibility, and increases competitiveness, thereby supporting long-term growth and financial stability

## 5. Scalable, Multi-Channel Distribution Infrastructure

The Company has built a robust, multi-channel distribution network covering modern, general trade, and e-commerce. This allows it to address varied consumer segments, reduce channel risk, and respond swiftly to market shifts. Its omnichannel strategy ensures strong product visibility and revenue diversification across platforms.

## 6. Wide Retail Presence Across Leading Modern Trade and Institutional Partners

The Company has established a strong foothold in the offline retail segment, generating retail revenue of approximately ₹ 41.23 crores through partnerships with prominent modern trade chains and institutional buyers. This extensive retail presence reflects the Company's ability to build and sustain long-term relationships with leading national and regional retailers, ensuring deep market penetration across high-demand categories such as Back to School, Bags, and Plush products.
