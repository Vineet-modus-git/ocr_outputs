24. There have been instances of delayed filings in the past with certain Regulatory Authorities. If the Regulatory Authorities impose any monitory penalties on us or take any punitive actions against our Company in relation to the same, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

There have been instances of delayed filings in the past with certain regulatory authorities with respect to filings related to GST returns, PF and ESIC payments. As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there have been no penalties levied on our Company for such delays / defaults. However, it cannot be assured that even in future no such delay will happen or no such penalty will be levied. Therefore, if the regulatory authorities impose any monitory penalties on us or take certain punitive actions against our Company in relation to the same, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that such inaccuracies and delayed compliances will not happen in the future and that our Company will not be subject to any action by statutory or regulatory authorities, which may adversely affect our operating margins and consequentially, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Non-compliance with regulatory requirements can have significant financial and operational consequences for the Company. Failure to meet filing deadlines often results in financial penalties, late fees, and interest charges, increasing the Company's compliance costs and impacting cash flow. Additionally, regulatory authorities may scrutinize the Company's records, leading to audits, investigations, and possible legal proceedings, which further strain financial resources and management bandwidth. Moreover, rectifying past non-compliance requires additional administrative efforts, legal consultations, and resource allocations, adding to the overall compliance burden. Furthermore, reputational damage arising from non-compliance can erode stakeholder confidence, affecting relationships with customers, suppliers, and business partners.
