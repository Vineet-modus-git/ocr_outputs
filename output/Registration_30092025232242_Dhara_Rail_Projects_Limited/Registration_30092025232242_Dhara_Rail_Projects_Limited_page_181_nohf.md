## 4. Employee Benefits

### Short-term employee benefits

Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits and are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related services.

### Post-employment benefits

#### Defined benefit plans

The Company's gratuity is a defined benefit plan. The Company's net obligation in respect of a defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognized past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. Liability with respect to gratuity is determined based on an actuarial valuation done by an independent actuary at the year-end using the projected unit credit method.

The Company recognizes all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. All expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in employee benefits expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit related to past service by employees is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The Company recognizes gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when curtailment or settlement occurs.

#### Defined contribution plans

The Company makes specified monthly contributions towards employees' provident fund and employees' state insurance, which are defined contribution plans. The Company's contribution is recognized as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss during the period in which employee renders the related service.

### Long-term employee benefits

As per the company's policy, leave encashment is paid to employees in the year in which it becomes due. Unutilized leave is not permitted to be carried forward to subsequent financial years. Accordingly, there is no provision created towards leave encashment liabilities as at the balance sheet date, since no obligation exists beyond the current reporting period

## 5. Borrowing Costs

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
