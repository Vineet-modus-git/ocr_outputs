The Code does not affect any special or local laws, nor does it supersede any special jurisdiction or power conferred or any special form of procedure prescribed by or under any other law for the time being in force. The Code is the general law so that in case of conflict between the Code and the special law the latter prevails over the former. Where the special law is silent on a particular matter the Code applies, but consistent with the special enactment.

The law of criminal procedure is intended to provide a mechanism for the enforcement of criminal law. Without the proper procedural law, the substantive criminal law which defines offences and provides punishment for them would be almost worthless.
