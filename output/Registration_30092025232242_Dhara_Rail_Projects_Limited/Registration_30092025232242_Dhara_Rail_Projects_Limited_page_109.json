These events have also pressurised the global supply chains. This is reflected in higher levels of the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) in the quarter ending September 2024. shows that while container freight rates normalised in 2023, they experienced a significant surge in 2024. This was due to stronger demand, shipping route disruptions in the Red Sea, and delays at the Panama Canal, all of which have partially sustained inflationary pressures. The risk to inflation from increases in commodity prices seems limited in 2025- 2026. After softening in 2024, commodity prices are expected to decline moderately. While this easing is a positive sign, the risk of synchronised price increases remains, especially during periods of global economic stress. Although recent shocks like geopolitical conflicts and extreme weather have caused price fluctuations, their impact has largely subsided, leading to more varied commodity prices. However, escalating tensions continue to pose a risk of synchronised price increases, undermining the effectiveness of inflation mitigation."}]
