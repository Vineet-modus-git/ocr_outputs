Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of timing differences between taxable income and accounting income originating during the current year and reversal of timing differences for the earlier years. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible timing differences only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realized. In situations where the Company has unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward tax losses, all deferred tax assets are recognized only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that they can be realized against future taxable profits.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. The company writes-down the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer reasonably certain or virtually certain, as the case may be, that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which deferred tax asset can be realized. Any such write-down is reversed to the extent that it becomes reasonably certain or virtually certain, as the case may be, that sufficient future taxable income will be available.

## 7. Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they are entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the reporting period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, share split and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

## 8. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and / or accumulated impairment loss, if any. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes non-refundable taxes and duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the respective items of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent expenditures related to an item of property, plant and equipment are added to its book value only if they increase the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. All other expenses on existing property, plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the year during which such expenses are incurred.

Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on the Written Down Value (WDV) method. Depreciation is provided over the useful lives of assets estimated by the management which are equal to the useful lives prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 and provided as below:

<table><thead><tr><td>Category</td><td>Useful Life</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Computer & Accessories</td><td>3 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture & Fittings</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Office Equipments</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles - Motor Car</td><td>8 years</td></tr><tr><td>Plant & Machinery</td><td>15 years</td></tr></tbody></table>

The useful lives are reviewed by the management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the un-amortised depreciable amount is charged over the revised remaining useful life.

Depreciation on additions to property, plant and equipment is provided on pro-rata basis from the date the assets are ready for use. Depreciation on sale / deletion from property, plant and equipment is provided up to the date of sale / deletion.
