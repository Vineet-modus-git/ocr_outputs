## NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, 2006

This Policy seeks to extend the coverage, and fill in gaps that still exist, in light of present knowledge and accumulated experience. This policy was prepared through an intensive process of consultation within the Government and inputs from experts. It does not displace, but builds on the earlier policies. It is a statement of India's commitment to making a positive contribution to international efforts. This is a response to our national commitment to a clean environment, mandated in the Constitution in Articles 48 A and 51 A (g), strengthened by judicial interpretation of Article 21. The dominant theme of this policy is that while conservation of environmental resources is necessary to secure livelihoods and well-being of all, the most secure basis for conservation is to ensure that people dependent on particular resources obtain better livelihoods from the fact of conservation, than from degradation of the resource. Following are the objectives of the National Environmental Policy:

- Conservation of Critical Environmental Resources

- Intra-generational Equity: Livelihood Security for the Poor

- Inter-generational Equity

- Integration of Environmental Concerns in Economic and Social Development

- Efficiency in Environmental Resource Use

- Environmental Governance

- Enhancement of resources for Environmental Conservation
