# ANNEXURE TO THE STATEMENT OF SPECIAL TAX BENEFITS

The information provided below sets out the special tax benefits available to the Company and the Equity Shareholders under the Income Tax Act, 1961 presently in force in India. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive and is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice. Investors are advised to consult their own tax consultant with respect to the tax implications of an investment in Equity Shares particularly in view of the fact that certain recently enacted legislation may not have a direct legal precedent or may have a different interpretation on the benefits, which an investor can avail.

## A. SPECIAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAX BENEFITS TO THE COMPANY:

* The Company is not entitled to any special tax benefits under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and GST Act.

## B. SPECIAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAX BENEFITS TO THE SHAREHOLDERS:

* The Shareholders of the Company are not entitled to any special tax benefits under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and GST Act.

## NOTES:

1. The above Annexure of special tax benefits sets out the provisions of Tax Laws in a summary manner only and is not a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of shares.

2. The above Annexure covers only the special tax benefits under the Act, read with the relevant rules, circulars and notifications and does not cover any benefit under any other law in force in India. This Annexure also does not discuss any tax consequences, in the country outside India, of an investment in the shares of an Indian company.

3. The above Annexure of special tax benefits is as per the current direct tax laws relevant for the assessment year 2025-26. Several of these benefits are dependent on the Company or its shareholders fulfilling the conditions prescribed under the relevant provisions of the Tax Laws.

4. In respect of non-residents, the tax rates and consequent taxation mentioned above will be further subject to any benefits available under the relevant Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, if any, entered into between India and the country in which the non-resident has fiscal domicile.

5. A new Section 115BAA has been inserted by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 ('the Amendment Act, 2019') with effect from Financial Year 2019-20 granting an option to domestic companies to compute corporate tax at a reduced rate of 25.168% (22% plus surcharge of 10% and cess of 4%), provided such companies do not avail specified exemptions/ incentives. The option under section 115BAA of the Act once exercised cannot be subsequently withdrawn for any future financial year. The Amendment Act, 2019 further provides that domestic companies availing such option will not be required to pay Minimum Alternate Tax ('MAT') under Section 115JB. The CBDT has further issued Circular 29/2019 dated October 02, 2019 clarifying that since the MAT provisions under Section 115JB itself would not apply where a domestic company exercises option of lower tax rate under Section 115BAA, MAT credit would not be available.

In such a case, the Company is not allowed to claim any of the following deductions/ exemptions under the Act: -

* ✓ Deduction under the provisions of Section 10AA.

* ✓ Deduction under clause (iia) of sub- section (1) of Section 32 (additional depreciation).

* ✓ Deduction under section 32AD or Section 33AB or Section 33ABA

* ✓ Deduction under section 35AD or Section 35CCC

* ✓ Deduction under section 80G

Lower corporate tax rate under Section 115BAA of the Act and Minimum Alternate Tax ('MAT') credit under section 115JAA of the Act which are in general available and hence may not be treated as special tax benefits.

The Company has evaluated and decided to exercise the option permitted under Section 115BAA of the Act for the purpose of computing its income-tax liability for the Financial Year 2024-25 and onwards.
