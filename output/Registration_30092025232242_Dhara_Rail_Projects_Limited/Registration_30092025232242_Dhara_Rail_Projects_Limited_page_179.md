### 3. Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date, the results of operation during the reported period and disclosure of contingent liabilities as on the reporting date. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable and are in their best knowledge of current event and actions. Actual results could differ from these estimates and differences between actual results and estimates are recognized in the period in which the results are known or materialize. Significant estimates used by the management in the preparation of these financial statements include provision for employee benefits, estimates of the economic useful life of plant and equipment, provision for expenses, provisioning for taxation etc.

### 4. Current-non-current classification

All assets and liabilities are classified into current and non-current.

#### Assets

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;

b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;

c) it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date; or

d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

Current assets include the current portion of non-current financial assets. All other assets are classified as non-current.

#### Liabilities

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;

b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;

c) it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date; or

d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current liabilities include current portion of non-current financial liabilities. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

#### Operating cycle

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents. Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle being a period of 12 months for the purpose of classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current.
