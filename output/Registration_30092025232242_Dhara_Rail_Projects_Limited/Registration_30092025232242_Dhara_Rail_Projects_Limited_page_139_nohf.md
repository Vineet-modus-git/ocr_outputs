provisions of the Trademarks Act, an application for trademark registration may be made with the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks by any person or persons claiming to be the proprietor of a trademark, whether individually or as joint applicants, and can be made on the basis of either actual use or intention to use a trademark in the future. Once granted, a trademark registration is valid for 10 years unless cancelled, subsequent to which, it can be renewed. If not renewed, the mark lapses and the registration is required to be restored to gain protection under the provisions of the Trademarks Act. The Trademarks Act prohibits registration of deceptively similar trademarks and provides penalties for infringement, falsifying or falsely applying for trademarks. Further, pursuant to the notification of the Trademarks (Amendment) Act, 2010, simultaneous protection of trademark in India and other countries has been made available to owners of Indian and foreign trademarks. It also seeks to simplify the law relating to the transfer of ownership of trademarks by assignment or transmission and to bring the law in line with international practices.
