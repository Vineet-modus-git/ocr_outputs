Any circulars or notifications from the SEBI after the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus may result in changes to the above-mentioned timelines. Further, the issue procedure is subject to change to any revised circulars issued by the SEBI to this effect.

In terms of the UPI Circulars, in relation to the Issue, the BRLMs will be required to submit reports of compliance with listing timelines and activities prescribed by the SEBI, identifying non-adherence to timelines and processes and an analysis of entities responsible for the delay and the reasons associated with it.
