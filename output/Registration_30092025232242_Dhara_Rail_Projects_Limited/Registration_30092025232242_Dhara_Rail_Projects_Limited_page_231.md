E. OUTSTANDING DUES TO SMALL SCALE UNDERTAKINGS OR ANY OTHER CREDITORS

In accordance with the Materiality Policy, the Board of Directors of our Company considers dues exceeding 5.00% of our Company's trade payables as per the last Restated consolidated financial statements, to small scale undertakings and other creditors, as material dues for our Company.

As per Restated Consolidated Financial Statements, the trade payables of our Company as on March 31, 2025 were ₹824.14 lakhs. Accordingly, a creditor has been considered 'material' if the amount due to such creditor exceeds ₹41.21 lakhs as on March 31, 2025. This materiality threshold has been approved by our Board of Directors pursuant to the resolution passed on September 27, 2025. As on March 31, 2025, there are 47 creditors to each of whom our Company owes amounts exceeding 5.00% of our Company's total trade payables and the aggregate outstanding dues to them being approximately ₹561.49 lakhs.
