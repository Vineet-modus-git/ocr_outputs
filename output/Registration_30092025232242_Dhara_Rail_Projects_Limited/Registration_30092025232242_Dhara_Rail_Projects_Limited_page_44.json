We cannot assure you that such an event of cancellation of orders or orders being put in abeyance will not occur in future. In the event our client renege on our work orders or payments terms, our anticipated revenues may not materialize and we may be required to seek recourse to dispute resolution mechanisms which could be time consuming and, or, expensive which could adversely affect our financial condition.
