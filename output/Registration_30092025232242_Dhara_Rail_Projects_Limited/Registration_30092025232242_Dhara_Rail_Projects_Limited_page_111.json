Aggregate GVA surpassed its pre-pandemic trend in Q1 FY25, and it now hovers above the trend in the H1 FY25. The agriculture sector remains strong, consistently operating well above trend levels. The industrial sector has also found its footing above the pre-pandemic trajectory. The robust rate of growth in the recent years has taken the services sector close to its trend levels. A closer look at industrial sub-sectors reveals a spectrum of performances. Construction has been a standout, gaining momentum since mid-FY21 and soaring approximately 15 per cent above its pre-pandemic trend—an impressive feat driven by robust infrastructure development and housing demand. The utilities sector, including electricity, gas, water supply, and other services, reached its pre-pandemic trend by the end of FY23 and has consistently stayed above these levels. Manufacturing, while steadily recovering, remains slightly below its pre-pandemic trajectory. Meanwhile, mining continues to operate below its pre-pandemic trend. The recovery within the services sector has been uneven. Financial, real estate and professional services have taken the lead, surpassing pre-pandemic trend levels by the end of FY23. Public administration, defence, and other services followed suit, exceeding the trend for the first time in Q1 of FY25 since the onset of the pandemic. However, trade, hotels, transport, and communication services are gradually catching up with the pre-pandemic trend. These contact-intensive sectors faced challenges due to lockdown, restricted demand for travel, and reduced demand for hospitality, entertainment, and personal services."}, {"bbox": [297, 708, 1399, 1143], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [144, 1172, 1554, 1878], "category": "Text", "text": "The industrial sector grew by 6 per cent in H1 FY25. Q1 saw a strong growth of 8.3 per cent, but growth moderated in Q2 due to three key factors. First, manufacturing exports slowed significantly due to weak demand from destination countries, and aggressive trade and industrial policies in major trading nations. Second, the above average monsoon had mixed effects - while it replenished reservoirs and supported agriculture, it also disrupted sectors like mining, construction, and, to some extent, manufacturing. Third, the variation in the timing of festivities between September and October in the previous and current years led to a modest growth slowdown in Q2 FY25. Disaggregated data reveals that while many manufacturing sub-sectors experienced growth, others faced challenges, likely due to global and seasonal factors. Oil companies suffered due to inventory losses and lower refining margins, while steel companies faced price pressures and lower global prices. The cement sector faced weak demand in Q2 due to heavy rains and lower selling prices. However, with the conclusion of the monsoon season and the expected pick-up in government capital expenditure, sectors such as cement, iron, and steel are expected to see a recovery. Further, mining and electricity are expected to normalise after the monsoon-related disruptions. Despite various challenges, India continues to register the fastest growth in manufacturing PMI. The latest Manufacturing PMI for December 2024 remained well within the expansionary zone. The expansion rate for December 2024 exceeded its long-term average, driven by new business gains, robust demand, and advertising efforts. Meanwhile, international orders grew to a four-month high midway through the third fiscal quarter, signalling recovering external demand, as reported by companies. The services sector continues to perform well in FY25. A notable growth in Q1 and Q2 resulted in 7.1 per cent growth in H1 FY25. Across sub-categories, all the sub-sectors have performed well. The robust performance of the services sector is also reflected in high-frequency indicators (HFIs). PMI services have been in an expansionary zone during H1 FY25, supported by growth in new orders, rise in output, improvement in sales and enhanced employment generation. The hospitality sector performed well, with hotel occupancy rates in H1 FY25 similar to the previous year. Average daily rates and revenue per room increased due to higher corporate and leisure travel. Air cargo activity grew in double digits, while port traffic remained stable. Information Technology (IT) companies also performed better than the previous quarter"}]
