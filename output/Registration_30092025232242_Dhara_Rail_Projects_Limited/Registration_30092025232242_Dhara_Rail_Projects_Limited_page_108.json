Meanwhile, manufacturing-intensive countries like Germany and Austria are being weighed down by weak demand. Germany's structural weaknesses, particularly in manufacturing, have been noticeable, contributing to the slackness in Europe's manufacturing.

Within Asia, Japan's growth was hindered by domestic supply disruptions in the early part of the year, while China's growth weakened after the first quarter, affected by sluggish private consumption and investment, alongside challenges in the real estate sector."}, {"bbox": [142, 516, 1553, 747], "category": "Text", "text": "The global composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has stayed in the expansion zone for the fourteenth month in a row (as of December 2024). The services sector continues to show strength while manufacturing PMI indicated contraction. In 2024, the global manufacturing PMI started strong, moving into expansion for the first time since mid-2023 and remained so through the first half of the year. By July 2024, weaker conditions pushed the PMI back into contraction. Following four months of gradual declines, the global manufacturing sector stabilised in November with an index value of 50.0, indicating no overall change in operating conditions. Output growth in consumer and intermediate goods offset a downturn in investment goods. Increased production was attributed to stabilising new order intakes and the clearance of backlogs of work."}, {"bbox": [159, 779, 1558, 1316], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [142, 1349, 1553, 1705], "category": "Text", "text": "Production trends varied widely across regions in December. Production rose in 13 of the 30 nations for which December PMI data were available. The Eurozone saw the steepest contractions, led by France, Germany, and Austria. North America showed mixed results, with Canada's growth offset by declines in the US and Mexico. India reported the strongest expansion of output. The outlook for global manufacturing also remained subdued in December, with business sentiment dipping to a three-month low. On the global services front, the global Services PMI Business Activity Index rose to a four-month high of 53.8 in December. This signals expansion for the twenty-third consecutive month. Expansion was recorded across business, consumer, and financial services. Financial services experienced the fastest pace of expansion. Inflationary pressures ease, but risks of synchronised price pressures persist. Inflation rates across economies have trended downward steadily, approaching central bank target levels. This has been the result of tighter monetary policy regimes across the globe and supply chains adapting to higher levels of economic uncertainty. As a consequence, price pressures eased in 2023 due to a reduction in fuel prices. In 2024, it was attributed to a broad-based reduction in goods inflation."}]
