## BIDS BY FPI INCLUDING FII'S:

In terms of the SEBI FPI Regulations, the issue of Equity Shares to a single FPI including its investor group (which means multiple entities registered as FPIs and directly or indirectly having common ownership of more than 50% or common control) must be below 10% of the post-Issue paid-up capital.

In case of Bids made by FPIs, a certified copy of the certificate of registration issued under the SEBI FPI Regulations is required to be attached to the Bid cum Application Form, failing which our Company reserves the right to reject any Bid without assigning any reason. FPIs who wish to participate in the Issue are advised to use the Bid cum Application Form for Non-Residents (● in colour).

If the total holding of an FPI increases beyond 10% of the total paid-up Equity Share capital, on a fully diluted basis or 10% or more of the paid-up value of any series of debentures or preference shares or share warrants issued that may be issued by our Company, the total investment made by the FPI will be re-classified as FDI subject to the conditions as specified by SEBI and the RBI in this regard and our Company and the investor will be required to comply with applicable reporting requirements. Further, the total holdings of all FPIs put together, with effect from April 1, 2020, can be up to the sectoral cap applicable to the sector in which our Company operates.

In terms of the FEMA Regulations, for calculating the aggregate holding of FPIs in a company, holding of all registered FPIs shall be included.

The FEMA Non-Debt Instruments Rules was enacted on October 17, 2019 in supersession of the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations, 2017, except as respects things done or omitted to be done before such supersession. FPIs are permitted to participate in the Issue subject to compliance with conditions and restrictions which may be specified by the Government from time to time.

To ensure compliance with the above requirement, SEBI, pursuant to its circular dated July 13, 2018, has directed that at the time of finalisation of the Basis of Allotment, the Registrar shall (i) use the PAN issued by the Income Tax Department of India for checking compliance for a single FPI; and (ii) obtain validation from Depositories for the FPIs who have invested in the Issue to ensure there is no breach of the investment limit, within the timelines for issue procedure, as prescribed by SEBI from time to time.
