Financial turmoil in Asia, Russia and elsewhere in the world in recent years has adversely affected the Indian economy. Any worldwide financial instability may cause increased volatility in the Indian financial markets and, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the Indian economy and financial sector and us. Although economic conditions vary across markets, loss of investor confidence in one emerging economy may cause increased volatility across other economies, including India. Financial instability in other parts of the world could have a global influence and thereby negatively affect the Indian economy. Financial disruptions could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, economic developments globally can have a significant impact on our principal markets. Concerns related to a trade war between large economies may lead to increased risk aversion and volatility in global capital markets and consequently have an impact on the Indian economy. Recent developments in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in and may continue to result in a period of sustained instability across global financial markets, induce volatility in commodity prices, increase borrowing costs, cause outflow of capital from emerging markets and may lead to overall slowdown in economic activity in India. In addition, China is one of India's major trading partners and there are rising concerns of a possible slowdown in the Chinese economy as well as a strained relationship with India, which could have an adverse impact on the trade relations between the two countries."}, {"bbox": [144, 902, 1553, 969], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**66.

Further, there have been periods of slowdown in the economic growth of India. India's economic growth is affected by various factors including domestic consumption and savings, balance of trade movements, namely export demand and movements in key imports (oil and oil products), global economic uncertainty and liquidity crisis, volatility in exchange currency rates and annual rainfall which affects agricultural production. Any continued or future slowdown in the Indian economy or a further increase in inflation could have a material adverse effect on the price of our raw materials and demand for our products and, as a result, on our business and financial results. The Indian financial market and the Indian economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries, particularly in emerging market in Asian countries. Financial turmoil in Asia, Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere in the world in recent years has affected the Indian economy. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investors' reactions to developments in one country can have adverse effects on the securities of companies in other countries, including India. A loss in investor confidence in the financial systems of other emerging markets may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets and, indirectly, in the Indian economy in general. Any worldwide financial instability, including the financial crisis and fluctuations in the stock markets in China and further deterioration of credit conditions in the U.S. or European markets, could also have a negative impact on the Indian economy.
