environment pollutants in excess of such standards as may be prescribed. The Environment Act empowers the Central Government to make rules for various purposes viz., to prescribe: (i) the standards of quality of air, water or soil for various areas; (ii) the maximum allowable limits of concentration of various environmental pollutants for different areas; (iii) the procedures and safeguards for the prevention of accidents which may cause environmental pollution and remedial measures for such accidents.

## ENVIRONMENT (PROTECTION) RULES, 1986

In exercise of powers conferred under the Environment Act, the Central Government notified the Environment Rules. Pursuant to Environment Rules, every person who carries on an industry, operation or process requiring consent under Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 or Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or shall submit to the concerned Pollution Control Board ("PCB") an environmental statement for that financial year in the prescribed form.

## AIR (PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT, 1981

The Air Act requires any individual, industry or institution responsible for emitting smoke or gases by way of use as fuel or chemical reactions, apply in a prescribed form and obtain consent from the PCB prior to commencing any activity. The PCB is required to grant, or refuse, consent within four months of receipt of the application. The consent may contain conditions relating to specifications of pollution control equipment to be installed. Within a period of four months after the receipt of the application for consent the PCB shall, by order in writing and for reasons to be recorded in the order, grant the consent applied for subject to such conditions and for such period as may be specified in the order, or refuse consent.

## WATER (PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT, 1974

The Water Act aims at prevention and control of water pollution as well as restoration of water quality through the establishment of a central PCB and state PCBs. Under the provisions of the Water Act, any individual, industry or institution discharging industrial or domestic wastewater or establishing any treatment or disposal system or the using of any new or altered outlet for the discharge of sewage is required to obtain the consent of the applicable state PCB, which is empowered to establish standards and conditions that are required to be complied with. The consent to operate is granted for a specific period after which the conditions stipulated at the time of granting consent are reviewed by the state PCB. Even before the expiry of the consent period, the state PCB is authorized to carry out random checks on any industry to verify if the standards prescribed are being complied with by the industry. In the event of non-compliance, the state PCB after serving notice to the concerned industry may close the mine or withdraw water supply to the industry or cause magistrates to pass injunctions to restrain such polluters.

## THE NOISE POLLUTION (REGULATION & CONTROL) RULES, 2000

The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, were established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to regulate and control noise levels in public places to protect human health and well-being. These rules define acceptable noise limits for different areas, including industrial, commercial, residential, and silence zones, and specify the permissible noise levels during day and night. They also outline the responsibilities of authorities, such as the District Magistrate and Police Commissioner, in enforcing these standards. The rules mandate the use of sound level meters for measuring noise levels and provide guidelines for the use of loudspeakers, public address systems, and other noise-emitting devices. By setting clear regulations and enforcement mechanisms, the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, aim to maintain ambient air quality standards concerning noise and mitigate the adverse effects of noise pollution on public health and the environment.

## THE PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT RULES, 2016

The Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016, were established by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to address the growing issue of plastic waste in India. These rules mandate the responsibilities of various stakeholders, including local bodies, gram panchayats, waste generators, retailers, and street vendors, in managing plastic waste. The PWM Rules emphasize the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which requires producers, importers, and brand owners to take responsibility for the collection and recycling of plastic waste generated from their products. The rules also prohibit the manufacture and use of certain plastic products, such as carry bags and sachets, that are less than 50 microns in thickness. Additionally, the PWM Rules promote the use of plastic waste for road construction and energy recovery, thereby
