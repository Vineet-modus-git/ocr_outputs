**41. Effect of forfeiture**

The forfeiture of a share shall involve in the extinction of all interest in and also of all claims and demands against the Company in respect of the shares and all other rights incidental to the share, except only such of these rights as by these Articles are expressly saved.

**42. Evidence of forfeiture**

A duly verified declaration in writing that the declarant is a Director of the Company and that a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share, and that declaration and the receipt of the Company for the consideration, if any, given for the shares on the sale or disposal thereof, shall constitute a good title to the share and the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of shall be registered as the holder of the share and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.

**43. Non-payment of sums payable at fixed times**

The provisions of these regulations as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which by terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether, on account of the amount of the share or by way of premium or otherwise as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

Upon any sale after forfeiture or for enforcing a lien in purported exercise of the powers herein before given, the Directors may cause the purchaser's name to be entered in the register in respect of the shares sold and may issue fresh certificate in the name of such a purchaser. The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the regularity of the proceedings, nor to the application of the purchase money and after his name has been entered in the register in respect of such shares, the validity of the sale shall not be impeached by any person and the remedy of any person aggrieved by the sale shall be in damages only and against the Company exclusively.

c. An application for the registration of the transfer of any share or shares may be made either by the transferor or the transferee, provided that where such application is made by the transferor, no registration shall, in the case of partly paid shares, be effected unless the Company gives notice of the application to the transferee.
