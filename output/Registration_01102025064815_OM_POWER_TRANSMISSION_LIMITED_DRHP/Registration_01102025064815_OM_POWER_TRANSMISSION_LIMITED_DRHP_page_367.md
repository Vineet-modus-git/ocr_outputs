d) Investment properties

Investment properties are held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are measured initially at the cost of acquisition. The cost comprises purchase price, borrowing cost if capitalization criteria are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred.

On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its investment properties recognised as of transition date, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the Investment Property.

e) Intangible assets

An intangible asset is recognised, only where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will accrue to the enterprise and the cost can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets arising on acquisition of business are measured at fair value as at date of acquisition. Internally generated intangibles including research costs are not capitalized and the related expenditure is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss, if any.

Intangible assets are amortized on Written down value over the economic useful life estimated by the management and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss under the head "Depreciation and Amortization expense". The estimated useful life of the intangible assets and the amortization period are reviewed at the end of each financial year, and the amortization period is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if any.

On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its intangible assets recognised as of transition date, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of Intangible Asset.

f) Inventories

The stock of construction materials, stores, and spares is valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost is determined on First in First out basis and includes all applicable cost of bringing the goods to their present location and condition.

Inventories are valued as per following method:

<table><thead><tr><td>Items</td><td>Method of Valuation</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Raw Materials and Components</td><td>At Cost or NRV, whichever is lower</td></tr><tr><td>Work-in-progress</td><td>At Cost or NRV, whichever is lower</td></tr></tbody></table>
