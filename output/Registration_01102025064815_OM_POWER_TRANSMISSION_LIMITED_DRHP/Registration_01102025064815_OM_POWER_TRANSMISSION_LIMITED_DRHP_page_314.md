**Key accounting estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires the management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Examples of such estimates include estimation of useful lives of property plant and equipment, employee costs, assessments of recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets, trade receivables and cash generating units, provisions against litigations and contingencies. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed by management at each reporting date. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Any revision of these estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

**(i) Deferred income taxes**

The assessment of the probability of future taxable profit in which deferred tax assets can be utilized is based on the Company's latest forecast, which is adjusted for significant non-taxable profit and expenses and specific limits to the use of any unused tax loss or credit. The tax rules in the different jurisdictions in which the Company operate are also carefully taken into consideration. If a positive forecast of taxable profit indicates the probable use of a deferred tax asset, especially when it can be utilized without a time limit, that deferred tax asset is usually recognised in full.

**(ii) Revenue recognition**

Determination of revenue under percentage of completion method necessarily involves making estimates, some of which are of a technical nature, concerning, where relevant, the percentage of completion, costs to completion, the expected revenue from the project or activity and foreseeable losses to completion. Estimates of project income, as well as project costs, are reviewed periodically. The effect of changes, if any, to estimates is recognised in the financial statements for the year in which such changes are determined.

**(iii) Current income taxes**

The tax jurisdiction for the Company is India. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes including judgment on whether tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods. The recognition of taxes that are subject to certain legal or economic limits or uncertainties is assessed individually by management based on the specific facts and circumstances.

**(iv) Accounting for defined benefit plans**

In accounting for post-retirement benefits, several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used to calculate plan expenses and liabilities. These factors include expected discount rate assumptions and rate of future compensation increases. To estimate these factors, actuarial consultants also use estimates such as withdrawal, turnover, and mortality rates which require significant judgment. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results in future periods due to changing market and economic conditions, regulatory events, judicial rulings, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter participant life spans.

**(v) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets**

The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods.

**(vi) Impairment**

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount to determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each asset or cash generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future
