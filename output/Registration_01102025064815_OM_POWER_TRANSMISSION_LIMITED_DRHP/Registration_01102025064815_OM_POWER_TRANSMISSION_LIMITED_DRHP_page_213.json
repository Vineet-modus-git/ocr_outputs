Frequent amendments to environmental regulations, land acquisition rules, and grid connectivity procedures often lead to delays in project approvals and cost escalations. For example, obtaining Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) clearance, forest clearances, and securing right-of-way (ROW) can be time-consuming and subject to policy shifts at both central and state levels. These uncertainties are particularly challenging for long-gestation projects like transmission lines or large-scale renewable parks, where planning is done years in advance. The lack of consistency in regulations also deters private investment and makes financial closure more complex. As a result, EPC contractors face increased compliance risks and uncertainty in project timelines.\n* **Commodity Price Fluctuations:** Commodity Price Fluctuations are a critical threat to EPC contractors, especially in the power sector where infrastructure projects rely heavily on materials like steel, copper, aluminum, and cement. Sudden spikes in global or domestic commodity prices can sharply erode project margins, particularly for fixed-price contracts that do not incorporate robust escalation clauses. EPC firms often operate on thin profit margins and long project cycles, making them vulnerable to such cost shocks. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and changes in import duties can further amplify input cost volatility. Without adequate hedging or flexible contract structures, contractors may be forced to absorb losses, impacting financial stability and future bidding capacity.\n* **Payment Delays from DISCOMs:** Payment Delays from DISCOMs remain a persistent challenge for EPC firms executing power infrastructure projects. Many state-owned distribution companies (DISCOMs) face chronic"}]
