On February 24, 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. Although the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, this conflict and responses from international communities could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and espionage.

To date, we have not experienced any material interruptions in our operations and distribution network in connection with these conflicts. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict in Ukraine as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions, are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have a substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, any slowdown or perceived slowdown in the Indian economy, or in specific sectors of the Indian economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the price of the Equity Shares.

**74. Terrorist attacks, communal disturbances, civil unrest and other acts of violence or was involving India and other countries in which we have operations may adversely affect the financial markets and our business.**

Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may negatively affect the Indian markets on which our Equity Shares trade and also adversely affect markets in which we have operations, as well as the worldwide financial markets. These acts may also result in a loss of business confidence, and adversely affect our business. In addition, any deterioration in relations between India and its neighbouring countries might result in investor concern about stability in the region, which may adversely affect the price of our Equity Shares.

Some states in India have also witnessed civil unrest including communal disturbances in recent years and it is possible that future civil unrest, as well as other adverse social, economic and political events in India may have a negative impact on us. Such incidents may also create a greater perception that investment in Indian companies involves a higher degree of risk and may have an adverse impact on our business and the price of our Equity Shares.

**75. Any downgrading of India's debt rating by an independent agency may harm our ability to raise financing**

Any adverse revisions to India's credit ratings for domestic and international debt by domestic or international rating agencies may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing and the interest rates and other commercial terms on which such additional financing is available. This could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditure plans, business and financial performance and the price of our Equity Shares.
