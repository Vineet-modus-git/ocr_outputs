# OM POWER TRANSMISSION LIMITED (formerly known as OM POWER TRANSMISSION PRIVATE LIMITED)

## Notes to the Financial Statement as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025

### g) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits with banks, short-term balances (with an original maturity of three months or less), highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Margin money deposits, earmarked balances with banks and other bank balances which have restrictions are presented as other bank balances.

For the purpose of statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash.

### h) Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs consist of interest, ancillary costs, and other costs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

Borrowing costs attributable to acquisition and/or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as a part of the cost of such assets, up to date such assets are ready for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss.

### i) Impairment of non-financial assets

The Company assesses at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset recoverable amount is the higher of an asset or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value, less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Groups of assets.

When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

### j) Leases Company as a lessee

At the commencement date of a lease, the Company recognises a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation, impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised and lease payments made at or before the commencement date. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

The Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date.

After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification or a change in the lease term. The Company separately recognises the interest expense on the lease liability as finance cost and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.

The Company accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease when both of the following conditions are met:

* The modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets.

* The consideration for the lease increases commensurate with the price for the increase in scope and any adjustments to that stand-alone price reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.

For a lease modification that fully or partially decreases the scope of the lease the Company decreases the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect partial or full termination of the lease. Any difference between those adjustments is recognised in profit or loss at the effective date of the modification.
