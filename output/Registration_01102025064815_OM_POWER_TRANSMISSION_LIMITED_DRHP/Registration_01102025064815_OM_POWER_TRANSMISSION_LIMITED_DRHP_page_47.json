Working capital is required for expansion activities and operational requirements. Further, since the contracts we bid for typically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, it is difficult to predict whether or when a particular contract will be awarded to us. As a result, we may need to incur expenses in anticipation of contract awards, which may not eventually materialize, and finance such expenses by incurring additional indebtedness. Our working capital requirements may increase in the future if we undertake larger or additional projects or projects with a long gestation period, if payment terms do not include advance payments or if contracts have payment schedules that shift payments towards the end of a project or otherwise increase our working capital burden.
