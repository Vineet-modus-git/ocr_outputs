Inflation level is reaching within the central bank's target; the RBI may pursue further monetary easing that will support growth. The medium-term outlook is bright, fueled by the emphasis on physical and digital infrastructure spending. With a focus on stimulating demand, driving investment and ensuring inclusive development, the budget introduces measures such as tax relief, increased infrastructure spending and incentives for manufacturing and clean energy. These initiatives aim to accelerate growth while maintaining fiscal discipline, reinforcing India's long-term economic resilience. The expansion of tax relief i.e zero tax liability for individuals earning up to INR 12 lacs annually under the new tax regime is expected to strengthen household finances and, consequently, boost consumption."}, {"bbox": [153, 1166, 1498, 1264], "category": "Text", "text": "The external sector remains resilient, and key external vulnerability indicators continue to improve.

India's electricity landscape is characterized by its vast, diverse, and rapidly evolving infrastructure that supports one of the world's largest and most complex power systems. The country's electricity ecosystem is shaped by a mixed energy basket, including thermal, hydro, nuclear, and a growing share of renewable energy sources. With growing industrialization, urbanization, and rural electrification, the demand for electricity continues to rise steadily, pushing the sector towards capacity expansion, technological upgrades, and policy reforms. India's power sector has undergone significant transformation, particularly in terms of increasing private sector participation, regulatory structuring, and focus on sustainability."}, {"bbox": [153, 1713, 1498, 1908], "category": "Text", "text": "Government-led reforms, institutional restructuring, and schemes like “Power for All” have focused on ensuring universal access, improving power quality, and modernizing outdated infrastructure.
