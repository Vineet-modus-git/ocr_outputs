Transmission lines enable the efficient transfer of bulk power from generation sources, which are often located in remote areas, to substations situated closer to end-users. (Source: D&B Report.) By operating at high voltages, they minimize energy losses during long-distance transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective delivery of electricity. They also provide grid stability by interconnecting different regions, allowing power to be balanced and rerouted in case of shortages or faults. Further, transmission lines are critical for integrating renewable energy projects such as solar and wind, which are typically set up in geographically isolated locations, into the main grid.
