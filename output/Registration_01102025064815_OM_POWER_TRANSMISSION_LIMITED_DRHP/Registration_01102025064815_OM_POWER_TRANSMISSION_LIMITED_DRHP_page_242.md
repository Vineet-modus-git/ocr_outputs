Gujarat is one of the leading state in Transmission Infrastructure with addition of 3,428 CKM of transmission lines and 108 substations during 2023-2024. It also has strong solar and wind potential, especially in regions like Kutch and Saurashtra. The state hosts significant REZs and hybrid renewable energy parks. It is actively developing transmission corridors to evacuate power from these zones efficiently. Gujarat is also investing in offshore wind energy development along its coastline. Its proactive policies and ease of land availability have made it a preferred RE destination. (Source: D&B Report).

In light of these favourable tailwinds, operations have historically been concentrated in Gujarat, we have recently diversified our footprint by securing contracts in Punjab and Rajasthan. We intend to continue expanding our presence across other States to capture opportunities arising from increased investments in transmission infrastructure, renewable energy and power evacuation, and modernization of grid systems.

India's Power Transmission & Distribution (T&D) infrastructure is expected to grow, supported by government initiatives and increasing electricity demand (Source: D&B Report). The government plans to add approximately 17,500 ckm of transmission lines and 80,000 MVA of transformation capacity annually over the next three years (Source: D&B Report). We intend to leverage these sectoral growth drivers by selectively pursuing projects that align with our execution expertise.

In line with our growth strategy, we propose to deploy a portion of the Net Proceeds towards funding our long-term working capital requirements, which will enhance our financial capacity to submit requisite bid deposits, performance guarantees, and project-specific mobilization advances, thereby enabling us to pursue and execute high-value projects more efficiently. We also intend to utilise a portion of the Net Proceeds towards purchase of machinery and equipment to be used for project execution which will help in various functions of our existing business verticals such as stringing of transmission lines, fault detection in underground cables, ease in transportation, loading and unloading of material and better utilisation of resources. For further details, see "Objects of the Offer" on page 108. Through these investments, we intend to leverage industry growth trends and scale our business operations in order to strengthen our position as a reliable EPC player for complex and large-scale power sector projects.

### Our Bidding Process

#### Identifying Tenders

We regularly keep note of potential tenders to identify projects that could be of interest to us. Further, we conduct detailed research to identify upcoming government tenders and private projects in target states, focusing on sectors like transmission line, sub-stations, underground cable and operation and maintenance of substations. In case of private customers, initial consultation and assessment is conducted through discussions to understand the client's requirements.

Further, we assess the project scope, budget, timelines and review any design preferences, compliance standards, or unique requirements the client may have. If a project is of interest, we evaluate our credentials considering the eligibility criteria specified for the project. We endeavour to qualify on our own for projects that are of interest. In the event we do not qualify due to eligibility requirements, we may seek to form project-specific joint ventures with qualified contractors with relevant experience.

#### Tendering Process:

Upon completion of the pre-qualification stage for a particular bid, we do a detailed analysis in relation to the scope of work, construction method, equipment required and estimates of project materials. This analysis is prepared by the tendering team along with the project team and shared with the management along with a risk pricing plan and a risk mitigation plan. In case the risk associated with a project is beyond the limits set out in our risk review guidelines, these
