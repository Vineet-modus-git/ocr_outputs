Notes to the Financial Statement as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025

Re-measurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the statement of assets and liabilities.

Obligation is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate that is determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on Government bonds where the currency and the terms of Government bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated term of defined benefit obligation.

r) Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equities shares outstanding during the period.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding are adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential equity shares from the exercise of options on unissued share capital. The number of equity shares is the aggregate of the weighted average number of equity shares and the weighted average number of equity shares which are to be issued in the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

s) Exceptional items

When items of income and expense within profit or loss from ordinary activities are of such size, nature or incidence that their disclosure is relevant to explain the performance of the enterprise for the period, the nature and amount of such material items are disclosed separately as exceptional items.
