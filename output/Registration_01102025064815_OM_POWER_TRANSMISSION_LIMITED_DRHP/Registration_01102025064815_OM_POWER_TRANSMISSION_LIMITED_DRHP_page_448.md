**27. When call deemed to have been made**

A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising such call was passed. The Board of Directors making a call may by resolution determine that the call shall be deemed to be made on a date subsequent to the date of the resolution, and in the absence of such a provision, a call shall be deemed to have been made on the same date as that of the resolution of the Board of Directors making such calls.

If the sum payable in respect of any call or, installment be not paid on or before the day appointed for payment thereof, the holder for the time being of the share in respect of which the call shall have been made or the installment shall fall due, shall pay interest for the same at the rate of 12 percent per annum, from the day appointed for the payment thereof to the time of the actual payment or at such lower rate as the Directors may determine. The Board of Directors shall also be at liberty to waive payment of that interest wholly or in part.

The provisions of these Articles as to payment of interest shall apply in the case of non-payment of any such sum which by the terms of issue of a share, become payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the amount of the share or by way of premium, as if the same had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

**32. Payment of call in advance**

The Board of Directors, may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to advance all of or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him and upon all or any part of the moneys so advance may (until the same would, but for such advance become presently payable) pay interest at such rate as the Board of Directors may decide but shall not in respect of such advances confer a right to the dividend or participate in profits.
