EPC firms are now expected to implement sophisticated automation, real-time monitoring, and AI-driven controls to meet new efficiency and reliability benchmarks. However, many smaller or regional EPC players face challenges in adopting these technologies due to limited access to skilled personnel, high capital investment requirements, and lack of in-house R&D capabilities. This technological gap can hinder their competitiveness and limit their participation in high-value, future-ready infrastructure projects."}, {"bbox": [151, 453, 1499, 682], "category": "Text", "text": "**Manpower and Skill Gaps:** Manpower and skill gaps present a persistent challenge for EPC firms operating in the power sector. Projects often require specialized technical personnel for functions like detailed design, site execution, quality assurance, and safety compliance. However, sourcing experienced engineers, supervisors, and skilled technicians especially for remote or infrastructure-deficient sites remains difficult. This shortage can lead to project delays, suboptimal execution, and increased rework. The situation is further compounded by limited training infrastructure and skill development programs tailored to emerging technologies in renewables and smart grid systems, widening the talent gap in the industry."}, {"bbox": [151, 711, 1499, 937], "category": "Text", "text": "**Coordination with Multiple Stakeholders:** Coordination with multiple stakeholders is a critical and often complex aspect of EPC project execution in the power sector. These projects typically involve central agencies like SECI or PGCIL, state utilities, local government bodies, landowners, vendors, and subcontractors all of whom operate under different regulatory frameworks and timelines. Aligning their inputs for approvals, clearances, and execution requires meticulous planning and communication. Delays in any one interface such as delayed permits or material supply can cascade into broader project setbacks. Effective stakeholder management thus demands strong project governance, digital tracking systems, and continuous engagement across all tiers."}, {"bbox": [151, 966, 750, 1003], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Threat & Challenges in the Overall EPC Industry"}, {"bbox": [151, 1032, 261, 1066], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### Threats:"}, {"bbox": [300, 1084, 1347, 1602], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [151, 1637, 1501, 2127], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Rising Import Dependency on Critical Equipment:** Rising import dependency on critical power infrastructure equipment poses a significant threat to the EPC industry in India. Components such as solar inverters, power transformers, and advanced switchgear are often sourced from countries like China, Germany, and the U.S., making the sector vulnerable to external market dynamics. Any disruption in trade due to geopolitical tensions, global supply chain constraints, or protectionist policies can lead to delays in project execution and increased capital costs. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates further impact procurement budgets, especially for fixed-price contracts. This dependence also undermines the government's push for self-reliance under the \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" initiative.\n* **Delays in Statutory Approvals:** Delays in statutory approvals pose a significant risk to EPC projects in the power infrastructure sector. Projects located near forest areas, coastal regulation zones (CRZ), or defense establishments often require clearances from multiple government bodies such as the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Ministry of Defence (MoD), or coastal authorities. The bureaucratic nature of these processes, combined with overlapping jurisdiction and lack of streamlined timelines, frequently results in prolonged approval cycles. This leads to project execution delays, higher holding costs, and increased financial exposure for EPC"}]
