To ensure that electricity generated in REZs reaches demand centers efficiently, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL) plan transmission systems well in advance of project commissioning. This includes dedicated green energy corridors, high-voltage substations, and inter-state lines designed to carry power from RE-rich states to load centers.
