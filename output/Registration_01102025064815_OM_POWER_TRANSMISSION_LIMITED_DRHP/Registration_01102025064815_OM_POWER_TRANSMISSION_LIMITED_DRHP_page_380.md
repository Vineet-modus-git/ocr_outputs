Due to the factors discussed above, our profit for the year increased by 197.94% from ₹ 741.24 lakhs for Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 2,208.48 lakhs for Fiscal 2025. Profit after tax as a percentage of total income increased from 4.02% in Fiscal 2024 to 7.84% in Fiscal 2025. The improvement in net profit margin in Fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by lower Right of way and crop compensation expenses, which declined to ₹1,250.27 lakhs (4.44% of total income) in Fiscal 2025 as compared to ₹2,638.23 lakhs (14.31% of total income) in Fiscal 2024.

Consequently, these projects have contributed to an improvement in our overall profit margin.
