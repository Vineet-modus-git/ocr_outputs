The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component since it is usually intended to provide customer with a form of security for Company's remaining performance as specified under the contract, which is consistent with the industry practice. The Company does not require collateral in respect of its trade receivables. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions, if any. In case of disputed trade receivables, the Company performs individual credit risk assessment and creates expected credit loss allowance (ECL) based on internal assessment for such cases."}]
