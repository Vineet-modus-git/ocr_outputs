India's electricity consumption has shown a steady increase across all consumer categories between FY 2020 -24. Domestic consumption rose from 308.75 BU in FY 2020 to 375.00 BU in FY 2024, indicating a growing demand for household electricity due to urbanization and rising appliance usage. The commercial sector exhibited fluctuations, dropping to 86.95 BU in FY 2021 due to the pandemic but rebounding to 125.00 BU in FY 2024.

Industrial electricity consumption, a key driver of economic activity, saw a dip in FY 2021 but recovered significantly, reaching 645.00 BU in FY 2024. The agricultural sector also saw consistent growth, with consumption increasing from 211.30 BU to 255.00 BU, highlighting the expanding demand for irrigation and farming operations. Traction and miscellaneous categories followed a similar upward trend, reflecting increased electrification in railway operations and other sectors. Overall, total electricity consumption grew from 1248.09 BU in 2019-20 to 1543.00 BU in 2023-24, underscoring India's increasing energy needs driven by economic expansion and infrastructure development.
