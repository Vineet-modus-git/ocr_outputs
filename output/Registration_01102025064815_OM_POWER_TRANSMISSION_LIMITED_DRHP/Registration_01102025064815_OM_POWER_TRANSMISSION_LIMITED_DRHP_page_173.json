This tier of the network caters primarily to residential households, small commercial establishments, and light industrial consumers. Electricity at this level is delivered through local distribution transformers, which step down power from medium-voltage systems such as 11 kV. The 230V/400V supply ensures compatibility with household appliances, lighting systems, office equipment, and small machinery, forming the final stage in the electricity delivery chain where safety, reliability, and voltage stability are paramount."}, {"bbox": [154, 466, 1498, 661], "category": "Text", "text": "Regulations issued by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and respective state electricity regulatory commissions mandate that supply to individual consumers must not exceed 230V for single-phase or 400V for three-phase connections under normal conditions. These levels are enforced under supply codes such as the MSERC Electricity Supply Code, 2011, which ensures voltage consistency and protection for consumer equipment. At the operational level, distribution transformers typically step-down power from 11 kV to 400V, serving clusters of households or small facilities across both urban and rural areas."}, {"bbox": [154, 707, 1498, 871], "category": "Text", "text": "Although low-voltage lines represent a smaller share of total transmission in terms of circuit kilometres, they form the most widespread and consumer-facing portion of the grid. India's distribution network below 66 kV spans over 14 million circuit kilometres, with a significant proportion attributed to this low-voltage tier. This segment is critical for last-mile connectivity, acting as the interface between utilities and end consumers, and directly shaping the quality and reliability of power supply experienced by millions of users across the country."}, {"bbox": [154, 900, 478, 937], "category": "Caption", "text": "**Low Voltage Applications:**"}, {"bbox": [154, 960, 1537, 1294], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [257, 1323, 282, 1353], "category": "Text", "text": "1."}, {"bbox": [154, 1388, 1498, 2108], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Residential Power Supply:** Low voltage is the standard for powering homes across India. It supports lighting, fans, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, and other household appliances. This voltage is safe for end-users and easy to control using domestic wiring and circuit breakers. Distribution transformers in neighborhoods step down power from 11kV to 400V to supply multiple homes. Electricity boards ensure voltage regulation to prevent fluctuations that can damage appliances.\n* **Shops and Small Commercial Establishments:** Small retail shops, salons, clinics, and local offices use 400V three-phase or 230V single-phase supply depending on their load. They run basic electrical equipment such as point-of-sale systems, air conditioners, coolers, lights, and freezers. These setups are designed for moderate power needs and do not require in-house transformers. Supply is typically metered by the local discom, with tariffs based on consumer category.\n* **Street Lighting and Public Utilities:** Street lighting systems, traffic signals, and small water pumps operate on 230V/400V networks. Municipal corporations are major users in this segment. Timers, control panels, and automatic switching mechanisms are integrated into low-voltage systems. These setups allow for easy maintenance and flexibility in controlling specific zones. Since safety is critical, protective devices like earth leakage circuit breakers are commonly installed.\n* **Schools and Small Institutions:** Educational institutions like primary schools and tuition centers use low voltage for lighting, computing, and fans. Labs and small server rooms can also be supported with this supply. These institutions are often part of dedicated low-voltage feeders in urban or rural localities. In rural areas, these are connected via pole-mounted transformers that supply a group of buildings."}]
