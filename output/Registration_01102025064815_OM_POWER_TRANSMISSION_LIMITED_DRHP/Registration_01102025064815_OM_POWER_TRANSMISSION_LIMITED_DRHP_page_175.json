The data shows a peak in FY 2021 with 16,750 ckm added, reflecting a significant infrastructure push possibly aligned with early post-COVID recovery and renewable integration efforts. This was followed by a relatively stable period from FY 2022 to FY 2024, with annual additions hovering between 14,200 and 14,900 ckm. However, FY 2025 saw a sharp decline to 8,830 ckm marking the lowest capacity addition in the six-year period. This downturn may be attributed to project delays, funding constraints, or a temporary saturation in capacity build-up after earlier acceleration phases.
