# OM POWER TRANSMISSION LIMITED (formerly known as OM POWER TRANSMISSION PRIVATE LIMITED)

## Notes to the Financial Statement as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025

Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment that meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their useful life. Costs in nature of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 as per Written down value method.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant and equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the time of disposal and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its property, plant and equipment recognised as of transition date, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the property, plant and equipment.

### d) Investment properties

Investment properties are held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are measured initially at the cost of acquisition. The cost comprises purchase price, borrowing cost if capitalization criteria are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred.

On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its investment properties recognised as of transition date, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the Investment Property.

### e) Intangible assets

An intangible asset is recognised, only where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will accrue to the enterprise and the cost can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets arising on acquisition of business are measured at fair value as at date of acquisition. Internally generated intangibles including research costs are not capitalized and the related expenditure is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss, if any.

Intangible assets are amortized on Written down value over the economic useful life estimated by the management and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss under the head "Depreciation and Amortization expense". The estimated useful life of the intangible assets and the amortization period are reviewed at the end of each financial year, and the amortization period is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if any.
