approximately INR 140.07 billion in central incentive support and expected investments of around INR 930.41 billion by 2026. The rollout timeline anticipates 7,400 MW operational by October 2024, 16,800 MW by April 2025, and the remaining 15,400 MW by April 2026.

When combined with Tranche-I's 8,737 MW, the scheme supports a total domestic solar module manufacturing capacity of 48,337 MW, backed by more than INR 185 billion in incentives. This initiative has already spurred the creation of over 1 lakh jobs (approx. 35,000 direct, 66,000 indirect), boosted domestic solar module capacity from under 10 GW to nearly 74 GW by March 2025, and sharply reduced India's reliance on imported modules. The scheme continues to promote integrated plants, local content sourcing and shifts in customs duty policy to further strengthen the Make in India framework.

## ➤ Biomass-based Cogeneration Programme (Biourja Programme):

The "Promotion of Biomass-based Cogeneration in Sugar Mills and Other Industries" initiative, a subsystem under MNRE's National Bioenergy Programme (2021–26), offers targeted Central Financial Assistance (CFA) to encourage efficient power generation using industrial and agricultural biomass residues. Eligible developers including sugar mills and biomass plants can receive funding at the rate of INR 25 lakh per MW for bagasse-based cogeneration and INR 50 lakh per MW for non-bagasse biomass projects (e.g. agro-residue, wood waste, energy plantations).

Launched through the BioUrja portal, this scheme streamlines online application, tracking, and approval for CFA, lowering capital costs and improving project bankability. The programme not only bolsters renewable energy generation in rural and industrial hubs but also enhances farmer income, manages agro-residue responsibly, and reduces reliance on fossil-fueled power plants while advancing renewable cogeneration targets.

### Insight on Government schemes to expand and modernize the power

India's power sector has witnessed significant reform and modernization efforts in recent years, especially in the Transmission and Distribution (T&D) segments, to meet the demands of growing energy consumption and increased renewable integration. The Government of India, through the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), has launched transformative schemes aimed at improving grid reliability, reducing technical and commercial losses, deploying smart metering infrastructure, and strengthening inter-state and intra-state transmission networks. Below are key initiatives supporting this mission.

➤ **Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS):** Launched in July 2021, the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) is India's flagship initiative to reform state-owned power distribution companies (DISCOMs), with a total outlay of INR 3.04 trillion until FY 2025–26. It aims to reduce AT&C losses to 12–15% and eliminate the ACS–ARR gap by FY 2024–25. The scheme supports DISCOMs with funding for infrastructure upgrades, prepaid smart metering, feeder separation, and energy accounting systems. As of mid-2025, over 198 million smart meters have been sanctioned and smart meter installations are progressing at a rate of nearly 80,000 units per day. The scheme also mandates strict reform-linked disbursements, with performance benchmarks and transparency requirements.

➤ **Green Energy Corridor (GEC):** The Green Energy Corridor (GEC) project, implemented in two phases by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in coordination with Power Grid Corporation of India, aims to develop dedicated transmission infrastructure for evacuating power from renewable energy (RE) generation zones to load centres. Under GEC Phase-I, intra-state transmission systems comprising approximately 9,700 circuit kilometres (ckm) of transmission lines and 19,000 MVA of substations were developed across eight RE-rich states. Building upon this, GEC Phase-II was approved by the Union Cabinet in January 2022 with a total outlay of INR 120.31 billion, targeting the construction of 10,750 ckm of transmission lines and 27,500 MVA of substations in seven states, including Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. The central government will provide 33% financial assistance for the approved projects, with implementation expected by 2025–26.

➤ **Inter-State Transmission System (ITS) Strengthening:** The ITS expansion, led by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL) under the Ministry of Power, plays a critical role in transferring bulk power across regions. The government is aggressively expanding ITS to accommodate large volumes of renewable energy through mega transmission projects. Notably, transmission charges for renewable and battery storage projects commissioned by June 2028 are waived, incentivizing investment in RE-heavy regions. Massive investments exceeding INR 2.5 trillion are being planned to strengthen the national transmission network, including 13 RE-rich clusters with targeted capacity addition of 500 GW non-fossil fuel power by 2030.
