A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if both of the following conditions are met:

a. The Company's business model objective for managing the financial asset is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and

b. The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

This category applies to certain investments in debt instruments. Such financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value changes are recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). However, the Company recognises interest income and impairment losses and its reversals in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## De-recognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:

* The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or

* The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass through' arrangement; and either.

- the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or

- the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.

- On derecognition of a financial asset, for financial assets measured at FVTOCI, the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## Impairment of financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:

* Debt instruments measured at amortised cost e.g., bank deposits

* Trade receivables

* Other financial assets not designated as FVTPL

For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Company determines whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.

ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

The Company follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on Trade receivables (including lease receivables). The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECL at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
