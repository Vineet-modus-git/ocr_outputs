between FY24 and FY27 compared to FY 10-20, aligning with India's target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 (Source: D&B Report).

Accordingly, to reduce geographical concentration and capture emerging opportunities, we have recently expanded into two new states. In the State of Rajasthan, we received our first letter of award from a state-owned utility company in Rajasthan for the complete EPC execution of a substation valued at ₹ 3,361.06 lakhs. In the State of Punjab, we secured our first letter of award from a state-owned utility company in Punjab for the EPC of a 66 kV transmission line valued at ₹ 8,844.89 lakhs.

Ultra-high voltage lines are increasingly being deployed under Renewable Energy Corridors to connect large solar and wind clusters in resource-rich states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. EHV lines facilitate bulk evacuation of renewable power, ensuring it can be delivered to load centres hundreds of kilometres away without significant losses. (Source: D&B Report).

We intend to continue exploring opportunities across other States in India, leveraging growth trends in the power transmission infrastructure. Our strategy is to gradually diversify our project portfolio across multiple geographies, thereby broadening our revenue base and mitigating risks associated with over-reliance on any single region. Further, we recognize that diversification across geographies not only enables us to pursue a wider pool of tenders but also provides resilience against project-specific or state-specific risks. Supported by the expertise of our Promoters, execution capabilities, and financial strength, we believe this strategy will enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the Indian power sector, strengthen our presence, and achieve sustainable growth over the long term.

**Continue to focus on increasing operational efficiency and cost management in relation to execution of our projects**

Our Company intends to strengthen its competitive position by increasing our operational efficiency and adopting cost management methods in relation to execution of turn-key EPC services for transmission line and substations. In the industry in which we operate, timely completion of project along with quality assurance and cost competitiveness are critical success factors. Accordingly, we intend to optimize our project execution process through enhanced planning, monitoring and risk management, ensuring that projects are delivered within stipulated timelines and budgets. The following table provides details of projects completed and ongoing, along with instances of contract fulfilment and performance guarantees, for the financial years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023:

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>For the year ended March 31, 2025</th><th>For the year ended March 31, 2024</th><th>For the year ended March 31, 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of Projects Completed</td><td>26</td><td>11</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Projects Ongoing</td><td>42</td><td>48</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Instances of non-fulfilment of contracts</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Performance guarantee held back</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table>

Our Company has a successful track record of completing the projects within the timelines agreed with our customers. We place strong focus on the quick and efficient mobilisation of our equipment and machinery, allowing us to start work on-site without delay. This reduces downtime, keeps project schedules on track, and helps us control costs.

Building on this approach, we intend to continue enhancing our execution processes to achieve timely and cost-effective delivery of transmission line and substation projects.

**Capitalizing on power transmission and distribution demand by bidding for large-scale, high-value projects across India**

During the last three Fiscals, we have completed EPC works aggregating to more than 400 CKM of transmission lines, over 65 CKM of underground cabling, and 4 substations. As of August 31, 2025, our unexecuted Order Book comprised 56 projects amounting to ₹77,619.35 lakhs, including 50 EPC projects and 06 O&M contracts. As of August 31, 2025, we were operating and maintaining 134 substations. We have demonstrated capabilities in executing specialized transmission structures like 36 QD type towers having height of 76.00 meters, each weighing 98.00 MT for 400 kV applications, including challenging crossover of HVDC lines.

Building on this track record, we intend to continue targeting projects of higher scale and complexity across India, particularly those where pre-qualification credentials, execution experience, and financial strength act as entry barriers. Our eligibility to bid for transmission line projects up to 400 kV, supported by our “AA” class accreditations with a state power transmission utility in Gujarat, reflects our proven technical competence in EHV execution. This accreditation, combined with our ISO-certified processes, positions us favorably in qualifying for larger-value projects with demonstrated technical and financial capabilities.
