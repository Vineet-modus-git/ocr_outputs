Fiscal 2023. However, we have experienced varying levels of employee attrition over the last three Fiscals, which may present risks to our business continuity and growth.

Set out below are details of attrition of our permanent employees for the Fiscals indicated:

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="3">For the Fiscal</th></tr><tr><th>2025</th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total no. of permanent employees</td><td>1,266</td><td>1185</td><td>958</td></tr><tr><td>Attrition rate of our permanent employees (%)*^</td><td>32.15</td><td>54.32</td><td>30.83</td></tr></tbody></table>

* Attrition rate has been calculated by dividing the total number of permanent employees who resigned during the relevant year/period with the total headcount of the permanent employees at the end of the year and the number of permanent employees resigned during the year/period.

Note: The attrition rate includes permanent employees deployed under short-term, project-specific O&M contracts, which involve higher employee turnover and therefore, impact the overall attrition rate.

We have faced challenges related to employee turnover in the aforesaid periods, and this may be attributed to factors such as competitive markets, changing employee expectations, and industry-wide trends in labor mobility. If the attrition rate continues at elevated levels, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, and future growth prospects.

## 30. There are certain defaults/ delay in payment of statutory dues by us. Any further default/delay in payment of statutory dues may attract regulatory action from the respective government authorities and in turn may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and cash flows.

We have had instances of defaults/delay in the payment of certain statutory dues with respect to tax deducted at source, goods and services tax and professional tax. The below table sets forth the instances of delay in statutory dues paid in the last three Fiscals.
