(ii) Deferred tax:

Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet approach on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities.

The Company recognises deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:

* When the Company can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and

* It is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

### c) Property, Plant and Equipment

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price, non-refundable taxes, levies and any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying property, plant and equipment.

Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment that meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their useful life. Costs in nature of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 as per Written down value method.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant and equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the time of disposal and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its property, plant and equipment recognised as of transition date, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the property, plant and equipment.
