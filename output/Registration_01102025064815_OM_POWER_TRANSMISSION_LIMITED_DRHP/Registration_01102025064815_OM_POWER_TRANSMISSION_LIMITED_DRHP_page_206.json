It covers over 2,400 circuit-km and is intended to evacuate renewable energy from the solar-rich Bhadla zone in Rajasthan to demand centers in northern India. This mega-project significantly boosts India's renewable evacuation capacity and reinforces grid integration across states.\n* **IndiGrid- Two Interstate Transmission Projects:** IndiGrid (an InvIT) won LOIs for two greenfield inter-state transmission schemes on a BOOT basis, totaling over INR 1,000 crore Capex. One project evacuates power from a 2 GW Dhule Renewable Energy Zone; the other expands Western Region transmission in Madhya Pradesh, including substations and LILO line setups. Both projects are designed to support renewable evacuation and grid expansion.\n* **Power Grid Corporation- New Green Energy Transmission UNCAPS:** PGCIL secured three critical ISTS projects: evacuation systems from Rajasthan REZ Phase-V (4 GW), boosting transformation capacity at Banaskantha, Gujarat, and an ISTS link for Kurnool-IV REZ in Andhra Pradesh. Combined, these projects are worth INR 10,750 crore and feature new substations, transmission lines, and pooling stations.\n* **Gujarat- Green Energy Corridor III:** The Gujarat government announced an INR 29,000 crore investment to develop GEC-III, which includes over 3,430 ckm of 765 kV lines and 860 ckm of 400 kV lines, connecting major RE zones in Kutch, Jamnagar, and central Gujarat. The corridor aims to transmit 16,500 MW of clean energy and enhance grid quality via statcom installations.\n* **AESL (Adani Energy Solutions Limited) Multi-Scheme Commissioning in FY 2026:** Adani Energy expects to fully commission six transmission schemes in FY 2026 including inter-state and intra-state projects with a combined Capex of INR 43,990 crore. The portfolio expansion includes over 696 ckm of new transmission lines and 15 projects under construction, strengthening capacity for renewable energy evacuation.\n* **Power Grid's ULDC and Transformer Upgrade Proposals:** PGCIL approved INR 6.5 billion in early 2024 for two key projects: ULDC Phase-III SCADA/EMS upgrade at northern SLDCs, and augmentation of a 765/400 kV transformer at Bhiwani as part of the Leh-Kaithal renewable corridor. Both expected to be commissioned in 2025.\n* **Indigrid- First Greenfield Project in Maharashtra:** Indigrid commissioned its first standalone project Kallam Transmission Ltd in Beed, Maharashtra to evacuate 1 GW of renewable power from Dharashiv region. The project supports local RE integration and strengthens regional power evacuation infrastructure."}, {"bbox": [153, 2017, 927, 2053], "category": "Text", "text": "Summary of Transmission System Planned for the period 2022-2027"}]
