In absolute terms, the sector's contribution has grown from INR 10.30 trillion in FY 2019 to an estimated INR 15.60 trillion in FY 2025, reflecting a significant expansion in construction activity across infrastructure, housing, and industrial domains. The dip observed in FY 2021, where GVA fell to INR 10.0 trillion, coincides with the economic slowdown and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the strong recovery from FY 2022 onward with GVA reaching INR 14.40 trillion in FY 2024 demonstrates the sector's resilience and the impact of large-scale government capital expenditure programs, such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and PM Gati Shakti."}, {"bbox": [151, 1233, 1499, 1430], "category": "Text", "text": "In relative terms, the construction sector's share in total GVA initially declined from 8.1% in FY 2019 to 7.8% in FY 2021, again reflecting pandemic-related contractions. Post-FY 2021, the share steadily increased, reaching 9.1% in FY 2025 (est.), indicating not just absolute growth but a stronger role of construction in the overall economy. This rise suggests an intensification of infrastructure-driven development, with construction increasingly contributing to India's GDP.
