These zones are part of the broader national strategy to accelerate the deployment of clean energy while ensuring cost-effective, large-scale integration into the national grid. The concept of REZs was introduced to overcome transmission bottlenecks by planning renewable energy generation and evacuation infrastructure in a synchronized manner. This proactive planning approach ensures that infrastructure is available in advance to support upcoming renewable projects, reducing delays and enhancing project bankability."}, {"bbox": [153, 584, 1499, 780], "category": "Text", "text": "REZs are identified based on a combination of factors, including high solar irradiance, strong wind speeds, availability of land, and proximity to transmission corridors. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), along with agencies like the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL), have collaborated to identify several such zones across the country. These zones are primarily concentrated in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka regions known for their abundant renewable resources.

It facilitates optimal resource utilization and enables economies of scale in both generation and transmission. By clustering renewable projects in specific zones, the government can ensure more efficient land use, streamlined approvals, and targeted policy incentives. Moreover, REZs play a pivotal role in supporting India's commitments under the Paris Agreement by driving the transition to a low-carbon energy system while promoting sustainable development in remote or underdeveloped regions."}, {"bbox": [153, 1033, 731, 1070], "category": "Text", "text": "## Major States Hosting Renewable Energy Zones:"}, {"bbox": [269, 1161, 1419, 1395], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [153, 1489, 332, 1526], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### Rajasthan"}, {"bbox": [153, 1555, 1499, 1688], "category": "Text", "text": "Rajasthan is a frontrunner in renewable energy development, especially solar power, due to its vast arid lands and high solar insolation.
