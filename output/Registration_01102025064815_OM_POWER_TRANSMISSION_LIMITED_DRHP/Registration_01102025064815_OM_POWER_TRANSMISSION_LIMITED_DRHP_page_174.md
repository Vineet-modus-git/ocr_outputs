*   **Agricultural Households and Pump Sets (Small Capacity):** Small farmers use 230V or single-phase 400V supply for low-power agricultural applications like domestic water pumps or drip irrigation systems. Though large agricultural pumps use higher voltage (11kV), households with limited land or water requirements can manage with this tier. Electricity boards may offer subsidized tariffs in this segment to support rural livelihoods.

## Insight on regional grids in India

India's electricity transmission system is broadly organized into five regional grids Northern, Eastern, Western, Southern, and North-Eastern each originally developed for planning and operational purposes. These regional grids were interconnected over time: the Eastern and North-Eastern grids in 1991, the Western grid in 2003, and the Northern grid in 2006, culminating with the Southern grid's synchronization in December 2013 via the 765 kV Raichur-Solapur line. With this final integration, India achieved the "One Nation, One Grid, One Frequency" model, unifying all regional grids under a single 50 Hz frequency regime.

The National Grid, now managed by Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) under the Ministry of Power, ensures frequency stability and inter-regional power exchange across the country. Operational control is exercised through Grid India (formerly POSOCO), which runs the National Load Dispatch Centre (NLDC), five Regional Load Dispatch Centres (RLDCs), and multiple State Load Dispatch Centres (SLDCs). These centers coordinate electricity scheduling, manage inter-state transmission, and integrate renewable energy sources at a national scale.

Each regional grid comprises a diverse energy resource mix: for example, the Northern and Western regions have substantial coal, hydro, and nuclear capacity, while the Southern and Western regions lead in wind and solar installations. Over time, renewable energy zones in these regions have become critical sourcing points, necessitating robust transmission links to share clean energy surplus across grids. The interconnected grid model facilitates optimal resource use and supports India's ambition to channel power from resource-rich to load-centric regions.

The unified grid has also positioned India as the largest synchronous grid in the world, with an installed generation capacity exceeding 480 GW as of mid-2025. Despite geographic exclusions such as the Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands, this integrated setup enables reliable electricity trade between regions, interstate power trading, and enhanced grid resilience. Cross-border interconnections with Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar further augment regional energy security under this national-level architecture.

In recent years, India has made substantial progress in expanding this network. Between FY 2020-25, India's power transmission infrastructure witnessed steady growth, both in terms of transmission lines and the transformation capacity of substations. The total length of transmission lines (AC+HVDC) increased from 425,071 ckm in FY 2020 to 490,374 ckm in FY 2025, reflecting an overall CAGR of approximately 3.1%. This expansion signifies continuous efforts to improve electricity transmission across the country, ensuring better connectivity and efficiency in power distribution.

Simultaneously, the transformation capacity of substations (220KV and above) saw a substantial increase from 967,893 MVA in FY 2020 to 1,337,513 MVA in FY 2025, marking a notable growth of around 6.7%. This rise indicates significant investments in substation infrastructure to support higher power loads, enhance grid stability, and facilitate
