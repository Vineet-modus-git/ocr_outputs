Through flagship initiatives like the **National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)**, **PM Gati Shakti**, **Smart Cities Mission**, and **Bharatmala and Sagarmala programs**, the government is driving coordinated investments in roads, railways, ports, airports, logistics hubs, and urban infrastructure. These initiatives aim to address critical infrastructure gaps, reduce logistics costs, and create seamless multimodal connectivity across the country. The government's strategic intent is to leverage infrastructure as a productivity multiplier and attract private investment through well-structured public-private partnerships (PPPs)."}, {"bbox": [151, 517, 1501, 746], "category": "Text", "text": "In parallel, policy measures such as faster project clearances, reforms in contract enforcement, digitization of approval processes, and increased central outlay in annual budgets reflect a clear push toward **efficient project execution and transparent governance**.
