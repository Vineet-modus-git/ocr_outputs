### 3. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC)

The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is the primary body responsible for regulating inter-state transmission of electricity and setting central-level tariff structures. It promotes open access to the transmission network and facilitates power trading across states, thereby fostering competitive electricity markets. By enforcing transparency and competition, CERC plays a key role in shaping market dynamics. Notably, its tariff frameworks directly impact the bankability of EPC projects by influencing return expectations, pricing mechanisms, and bidding strategies. As a result, EPC players must stay aligned with CERC regulations to ensure project viability and financial closure.

### 4. State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs)

Each state in India has its own State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), which governs intra-state generation, transmission, and distribution activities. SERCs are responsible for setting local electricity tariffs, approving capital expenditure plans of utilities, and resolving consumer grievances. They also play a central role in approving DISCOMs' power procurement and infrastructure investment proposals. For EPC firms operating at the state level, compliance with SERC regulations is essential. Project proposals must be structured in alignment with state-specific norms and tariff structures to secure approvals and win contracts, making SERCs highly influential in shaping localized EPC opportunities.

### 5. Grid Controller of India Ltd (formerly POSOCO)

Grid Controller of India Ltd, formerly known as Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO), is tasked with operating the National and Regional Load Dispatch Centres (NLDC and RLDCs). It manages real-time grid operations, including frequency regulation, contingency management, and overall system balancing. The agency plays a critical role in ensuring smooth integration of renewable energy sources, maintaining grid code compliance, and avoiding system disruptions. For transmission EPC projects, especially those involving renewable energy evacuation, Grid Controller of India Ltd is essential for pre-commissioning activities like synchronization, load testing, and operational handover.

**Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme:**

The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) has emerged as a flagship initiative aimed at enhancing the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of India's power distribution sector. As of July 2025, the scheme has witnessed significant traction, with a total outlay of INR 3,037.58 billion, including INR 976.31 billion as budgetary support. A major focus of the program is smart metering 204.6 million smart meters have been sanctioned, of which 24.1 million have already been installed.

Furthermore, the scheme has contributed to narrowing the average cost-revenue gap (ACS-ARR) to INR 0.69/kWh, reflecting improved financial discipline across DISCOMs. These metrics indicate the scheme's scale and momentum, which in turn is catalyzing demand for EPC services related to metering infrastructure, IT system upgrades, SCADA rollout, and feeder separation offering robust opportunities for both traditional EPC players and IT-BPM service providers engaged in execution, analytics, and system integration.

**RDSS has two core components:**

* Part A focuses on infrastructure modernization, including prepaid smart consumer metering, system metering (feeder and distribution transformer levels), and distribution network upgrades;
* Part B provides for capacity building, training, IT/OT enablement, and reform support.

Under the RDSS framework, financial assistance is disbursed based on a Results Evaluation Matrix (REX) DISCOMs must meet pre-qualification criteria and score at least 60% on weighted reform and infrastructure benchmarks. Eligible utilities must publish quarterly and annual audited accounts, eliminate creation of new regulatory assets, ensure timely subsidy payments, issue tariff true-up orders, and meet operational milestones. By February 2023, the Monitoring Committee had approved Action Plans and DPRs for 46 DISCOMs across 28 states/UTs. Sanctions included ~204.6 million prepaid smart meters, ~54 lakh DT meters, and ~1.98 lakh feeder meters, amounting to a sanctioned cost of over INR 1.15 trillion. These installations support real-time energy accounting and theft mitigation through advanced metering infrastructure (AMI).

As per updates from August 2023, AT&C losses dropped from 22.32% (FY 2020-21) to 16.4% (FY 2022), and the ACS-ARR gap shrank from INR 0.69/kWh to nearly zero. These achievements demonstrate early traction in reform-linked results. By mid-July 2025, the scheme had sanctioned 203.3 million smart meters across 28 states/UTs, with 24.1 million
