The growth in revenue from underground cabling is primarily attributable to the receipt of integrated EPC projects under this segment. Until Fiscal 2024, the Company was executing underground cable laying projects for only two customers. Leveraging the credentials and experience gained from these projects, the Company enhanced its focus on this segment in Fiscal 2025, leading to the award of higher-value projects in Fiscal 2024, which were subsequently executed in Fiscal 2025.

In addition, revenue from substation EPC Projects increased by 71.75%, rising from ₹1,353.61 lakhs in Fiscal 2024 to ₹2,324.76 lakhs in Fiscal 2025. This growth was primarily driven by the receipt and execution of higher-value new projects during the year.
