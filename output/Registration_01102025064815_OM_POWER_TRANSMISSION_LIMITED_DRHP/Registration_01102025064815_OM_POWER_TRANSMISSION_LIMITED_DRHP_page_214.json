These issues often translate into delayed payments to contractors, even when projects are completed on time. For EPC firms, such delays disrupt working capital cycles, strain liquidity, and increase reliance on short-term borrowing raising overall project risk. Despite government reforms like the RDSS aimed at improving DISCOM performance, payment reliability remains inconsistent across states, posing a material risk to contractors' financial health and operational continuity."}, {"bbox": [153, 421, 1501, 908], "category": "List-item", "text": "➤ **Aggressive Bidding Environment:** The EPC power sector in India faces a highly competitive bidding environment, particularly in government tenders and large-scale infrastructure projects. Many players, including newer or financially weaker firms, often bid aggressively sometimes below cost to win contracts. While this helps in acquiring projects, it significantly compresses profit margins and heightens execution risk. Such practices can lead to cost-cutting during implementation, compromising quality, safety, or timelines. In extreme cases, projects may be stalled or abandoned, damaging the reputation of the sector. This also puts pressure on established players to either match low bids or lose market share, thereby affecting industry sustainability.\n\n➤ **Policy and Fiscal Risks:** Policy and fiscal risks pose a major challenge to EPC firms operating in India's power sector. Sudden changes in tax structures such as revisions in GST rates on solar modules or electrical components can inflate project costs unexpectedly. Similarly, delays in the disbursement of government subsidies or incentives, especially under schemes like PM-KUSUM or rooftop solar programs, can disrupt cash flows and delay project execution. Uncertainty around annual budget allocations or lapses in financial approvals further erode investor confidence. These risks often impact financial modeling and bid pricing, leaving contractors exposed to unforeseen losses and reduced profitability."}, {"bbox": [153, 935, 353, 972], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**Key Challenges:**"}, {"bbox": [282, 988, 1364, 1547], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [150, 1589, 1500, 1818], "category": "Text", "text": "**Project Execution Complexity:** Project execution complexity is a fundamental challenge in the power EPC segment, as projects are often spread across remote, diverse, and logistically difficult terrains. Executing infrastructure in such areas demands meticulous planning, coordination with multiple subcontractors, local vendors, and equipment suppliers each with different timelines and capabilities. Additionally, navigating local regulations, securing permits, and dealing with unforeseen ground realities like extreme weather or resistance from local communities further complicate execution. Maintaining quality standards while adhering to strict project timelines in such conditions requires robust project management, technical adaptability, and contingency planning."}, {"bbox": [150, 1845, 1500, 2073], "category": "Text", "text": "**Logistical and Site-Level Constraints:** Logistical and site-level constraints are a major challenge for EPC projects, especially in the renewable and transmission sectors, which are often located in remote or difficult terrains like deserts, forests, or hilly regions. Transporting large and heavy equipment to these areas requires meticulous planning and reliable infrastructure, which is not always available. Inadequate road access, extreme weather conditions, and long distances from urban supply hubs can delay material delivery and raise transportation costs. Additionally, ensuring timely deployment and accommodation of skilled labor becomes difficult in such locations. These factors not only impact project timelines but also significantly increase execution costs and operational risks."}]
