With the planned expansion of our business and entry into new geographies, we will be required to onboard additional suppliers for our ongoing projects at new project sites. Since these new suppliers may not be willing to extend long credit periods, we may need to make advance payments for raw materials or settle dues within shorter credit tenures. Further, Our Company expects more favourable prices of material procured against advance payment and lesser payment duration terms, resulting into lower trade payable holding period. Consequently, the creditor days are expected to decline from 68 days in Fiscal 2025 to 56 days in Fiscal 2026, 51 days in Fiscal 2027 and 47 days in Fiscal 2028.</td></tr><tr><td>Other Financial Liabilities</td><td>Other Financial Liabilities primarily consists of Employee related payables and Security deposits.
