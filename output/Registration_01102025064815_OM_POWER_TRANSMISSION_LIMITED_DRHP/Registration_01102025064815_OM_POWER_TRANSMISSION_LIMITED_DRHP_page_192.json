These institutions ranging from policymaking authorities to tariff regulators and grid operators play distinct yet interlinked roles in shaping the sector's landscape. They facilitate transparent and competitive electricity markets, ensure infrastructure modernization, and drive alignment with national energy goals, including renewable integration and distribution reform. For Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) players, understanding the function and jurisdiction of these regulatory bodies is vital to navigate project approvals, grid compliance, and investment planning across generation, transmission, and distribution domains."}, {"bbox": [155, 1432, 518, 1466], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 1.
