power reliability and load balancing but also enhances transparency in power accounting, enabling DISCOMs to meet regulatory performance benchmarks and qualify for reform-linked funding.

➤ **National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM):** The National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM), launched in 2015 by the Ministry of Power, plays a pivotal role in modernizing urban power distribution networks through smart grid pilot projects. It supports the adoption of technologies such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Outage Management Systems (OMS) to improve the operational efficiency and transparency of utilities.

2. Major urban DISCOMs including those in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru are leveraging NSGM support to implement real-time system monitoring, remote fault detection, and automated load control. These deployments have enhanced supply reliability, reduced downtime, and laid the foundation for intelligent grid operations in high-demand zones.

➤ **Digitalization of Transmission Systems:** As part of India's grid modernization strategy, the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (PGCIL) is advancing the digital transformation of the national transmission network. Through deployment of Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) and Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), PGCIL is enabling high-resolution, real-time monitoring of grid parameters across the Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS). These technologies strengthen dynamic load management, improve grid resilience, and facilitate seamless integration of variable renewable energy. The digital infrastructure also supports faster fault detection, voltage stability, and enhanced coordination between load dispatch centres, ensuring a responsive and future-ready transmission backbone.

➤ **Consumer-Centric Technologies & AI Integration:** India's power modernization agenda has mandated the adoption of Time-of-Day (ToD) tariffs under the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Amendment Rules, 2023, requiring solar-hour rates to be 10–20% lower than normal tariffs and peak-hour rates to be 10–20% higher, depending on categories and time blocks.

ToD tariffs apply to commercial & industrial consumers from April 1, 2024, and to all non-agricultural consumers by April 1, 2025, with immediate applicability post smart-meter installation. These reforms are complemented by the rollout of prepaid smart meters, mobile apps, and AI-powered analytics to forecast peak loads, detect tamper events, and promote efficient consumer behavior. Together, the measures empower consumers with real-time insights and budgeting tools while improving DISCOM revenue assurance and grid flexibility.

## Renewable Energy (RE) Scenario in India

### Installed generation capacity & historical growth trends

India has made remarkable progress in expanding its renewable energy installed capacity, reflecting a strong commitment to sustainability and a greener energy future. Over recent years, the country has focused on harnessing renewable resources such as solar, wind, and biomass, leading to a significant transformation in its energy landscape. The installed capacity for renewable energy in India has demonstrated impressive growth. As of FY 2025, India's total installed power generation capacity reached approximately 475 GW, with renewable energy sources (excluding large hydro) accounting for about 46% of this total capacity. This marks a significant milestone in the country's renewable energy journey, highlighting the nation's growing commitment to sustainable energy. India's renewable energy capacity, which includes solar, wind, biomass, and small hydro, has surpassed 220 GW. Notably, solar energy capacity exceeded 100 GW by FY 2025, while wind energy also experienced substantial growth, reaching over 48 GW.

India globally ranks 4th in Renewable Energy Installed Capacity, 4th in Wind Power Capacity, and 5th in Solar Power Capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency's 'Renewable Capacity Statistics 2023.' This remarkable achievement is a testament to the country's accelerated shift towards renewable energy. The increase in renewable energy share in India's overall energy consumption has been fueled by supportive policy measures from the government, coupled with a growing awareness of the environmental impact of non-renewable energy sources and a desire to reduce dependence on energy imports.
