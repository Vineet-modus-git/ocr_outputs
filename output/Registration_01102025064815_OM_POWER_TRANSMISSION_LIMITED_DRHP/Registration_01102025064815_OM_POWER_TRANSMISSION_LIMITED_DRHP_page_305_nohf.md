# OM POWER TRANSMISSION LIMITED (formerly known as OM POWER TRANSMISSION PRIVATE LIMITED)

## Notes to the Financial Statement as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025

Contract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price.

Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract. Billing terms of the overtime contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The difference between the timing of revenue recognised and customer billings result in changes to contract assets and contract liabilities. Contractual retention amounts billed to customers are generally due upon expiration of the contract period.

The contracts generally result in revenue recognised in excess of billings which are presented as contract assets in the Balance Sheet. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as receivables in the Balance Sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component since it is usually intended to provide customer with a form of security for Company's remaining performance as specified under the contract, which is consistent with the industry practice. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognised till date. Liability is recognised for advance payments, and it is not considered as a significant financing component since it is used to meet working capital requirements at the time of project mobilization stage. The same is presented as contract liability in the Balance Sheet.

Estimates of revenue and costs are reviewed periodically and revised, wherever circumstances change, resulting in increases or decreases in revenue determination, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which estimates are revised.

Costs to obtain a contract which are incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained are charged off in statement of profit and loss immediately in the period in which such costs are incurred.

### i. Contract assets (Unbilled Revenue):

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.

### ii. Trade receivables:

A receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due).

### iii. Contract liabilities (Unearned Revenue):

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the company has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made, or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract.

### Other Income

Interest income from financial assets is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flow by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit losses.

Dividends are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss only when the right to receive payment is established; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the company and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.

Insurance claims are accounted for on the basis of claims admitted and to the extent that there is no uncertainty in receiving the claims.

Rental income is recognised on accrual basis.
