### m) Provisions (other than employee benefits)

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation because of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

### n) Contingencies

Disclosure of contingent liabilities is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial information. However, contingent assets are assessed continuously and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the assets and the related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs. Contingent assets are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

### o) Events after reporting date

Where events occurring after the Balance Sheet date provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, the impact of such events is adjusted within the financial statements. Otherwise, events after the Balance Sheet date of material size or nature are only disclosed.

### p) Cash Flow Statement

Cash flows are reported using indirect method whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of the transactions of non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts and payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing and financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.

### q) Employee Benefits

Short term employee benefits for salary and wages including accumulated leave that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which employees render the related service are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

### Defined Contribution Plan:

The Company pays contribution to the provident fund and employee state insurance corporation which is administered by respective Government authorities. The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The Contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss to the year it pertains.

### Defined benefit plan:

**Gratuity:** The Company's liability towards gratuity is determined using the projected unit credit method which considers each period of service as giving rise to additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation. The cost for past services is recognised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the amended benefits become vested.
