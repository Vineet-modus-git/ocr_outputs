However, the recovery of such compensation is typically a time-consuming process and the amount we are paid may not be adequate to recover the costs already incurred. Further, PSUs and government agencies typically have the right to change the scope of work to include additional work which was not contemplated at the time of execution of the contract. Although we may be entitled to additional fees for such increased scope of work (subject to a fixed cap), we may be required to mobilize additional resources, which may not be readily available on reasonable terms or within the stipulated project timelines. If we fail to comply with contractual or other requirements or if there are any concerns that arise out of a technical audit, we may be subject to monetary damages or civil penalties. Further, if any of our contracts with a PSU or government agencies are terminated, we may not be considered favourably for other government contract work. While there have been no such material instances in the past three Fiscals, if we are unable to manage changes in scope, recover compensation in a timely manner, or secure replacement contracts in the future, our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected."}, {"bbox": [215, 732, 1496, 1117], "category": "Text", "text": "With reference to projects where our bids have been successful, there may be delays in award of the projects and/or notification of appointed dates, which may result in us having to retain resources which remain unallocated, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.

The projects in our Order Book are subject to changes in our scope of undertakings as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. Our Order Book represents the estimated contract value of the unexecuted portion of our existing assigned EPC contracts. As on August 31, 2025, for the purposes of calculating the Order Book value, our Company takes into account the base value of ongoing projects as of the relevant date along with any escalation or changes in the scope of work. In case of contracts from private entities, no escalation is typically provided. Accordingly, the Order Book reflects the net number based on awarded contracts, inclusive of such adjustments. Further, project delays, modifications in the scope or cancellations may occur from time, due to delay in payments by our customers or our own defaults, incidents of force majeure, adverse cash flows, regulatory delays and other factors beyond our control. In view of the above, projects can remain in Order Book for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular undertakings required by the project.
