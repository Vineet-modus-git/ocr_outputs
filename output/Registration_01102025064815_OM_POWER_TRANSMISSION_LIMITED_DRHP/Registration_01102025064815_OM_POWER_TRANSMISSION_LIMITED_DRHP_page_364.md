government. Accruals for variable considerations are estimated based on accumulated experience and underlying agreements with customers.

### Sale of Goods:

Revenue from sale of products is recognized when the control of the goods have been transferred to the customer. The performance obligation in case of sale of products is satisfied at a point in time, i.e. when the material is dispatched to the customer or on delivery to the customer, as may be specified in the contract.

### Rendering of services:

Revenue from services is recognized over time by measuring progress towards satisfaction of performance obligation for the services rendered. The Company uses Input/Output method for measurement of revenue from rendering of services based on work executed.

The Company satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:

- As the entity performs, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance.

- The entity's performance creates or enhances an asset (e.g., work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.

- The entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

Performance obligations with reference to EPC contracts are satisfied over the period of time, and accordingly, revenue from such contracts is recognised based on progress of performance determined using input method with reference to the cost incurred on contract and their estimated total costs. Margin is not recognised until the outcome of the contract is certain. Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of a third party. Revenue, measured at transaction price, is adjusted towards liquidated damages, time value of money and price variations, escalation, change in scope etc. wherever, applicable. Variation in contract work and other claims are included to the extent that the amount can be measured reliably, and it is agreed with customer.

The Company evaluates whether each contract consists of a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is subject to many variables and requires significant judgement. The Company considers its experience with similar transactions and expectations regarding the contract in estimating the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled and determining whether the estimated variable consideration should be constrained. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Revenue is recognised when the Company satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised services or goods to its customers. When there is uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.

Contract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price.

Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of the work as stipulated in the contract. Billing terms of the overtime contracts vary but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The difference between the timing of revenue recognised and customer billings result in changes to contract assets and contract liabilities. Contractual retention amounts billed to customers are generally due upon expiration of the contract period.

The contracts generally result in revenue recognised in excess of billings which are presented as contract assets in the Balance Sheet. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as receivables in the Balance Sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component since it is usually intended to provide customer with a form of security for Company's remaining performance as specified under the contract, which is consistent with the industry practice. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue recognised till date. Liability is recognised for advance payments, and it is not considered
