Borrowing costs attributable to acquisition and/or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as a part of the cost of such assets, up to date such assets are ready for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are charged to the statement of profit and loss.

i) **Impairment of non-financial assets**

The Company assesses at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset recoverable amount is the higher of an asset or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value, less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Groups of assets.

When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

j) **Leases Company as a lessee**

At the commencement date of a lease, the Company recognises a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation, impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised and lease payments made at or before the commencement date. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

The Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date.

After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification or a change in the lease term. The Company separately recognises the interest expense on the lease liability as finance cost and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.

The Company accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease when both of the following conditions are met:

* The modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets.

* The consideration for the lease increases commensurate with the price for the increase in scope and any adjustments to that stand-alone price reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.

For a lease modification that fully or partially decreases the scope of the lease the Company decreases the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect partial or full termination of the lease. Any difference between those adjustments is recognised in profit or loss at the effective date of the modification.

The Company has elected to use the exemptions proposed by the standard lease contracts for which the lease terms end within 12 months of the date of initial application, and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with such leases as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

k) **Financial Instruments**

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial instruments (assets and liabilities) are recognised when the Company becomes a party to a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

Financial assets (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, other than those designated as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are added to or deducted
