The government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy generation, prompting a surge in solar parks, wind farms, and hybrid energy projects. The policy framework promotes independent power producers and facilitates bidding mechanisms that ensure competitive tariffs. Technological innovations like ultra-supercritical coal plants, floating solar panels, and offshore wind projects are being explored to increase generation efficiency and reduce carbon footprints. Decentralized generation through rooftop solar and bioenergy also plays a growing role, particularly in rural and remote areas.

**Transmission Segment:**

India's electricity transmission segment acts as the backbone of the power sector, enabling the transfer of electricity from generating stations to distribution networks across states and regions. The national grid, operated by the Power Grid Corporation of India and other state-level entities, is structured to handle high-voltage bulk transfers across long distances. A key characteristic of the Indian transmission system is its increasing inter-regional connectivity, ensuring resource optimization and power availability across different parts of the country.

The transmission segment has witnessed significant modernization with the introduction of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines, smart grid technologies, and real-time monitoring systems. Policies have encouraged private sector participation through tariff-based competitive bidding and joint ventures, contributing to both capacity and operational efficiency. Transmission planning has become increasingly aligned with the expansion of renewable energy, with the development of dedicated green energy corridors and grid integration solutions for variable power sources.

**Distribution Segment:**

The distribution segment is the most consumer-facing part of the electricity value chain and also the most stressed. It involves delivering power from substations to end-users, including residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial consumers. Distribution utilities primarily state-owned discoms have long grappled with issues like technical and commercial losses, poor billing efficiency, and financial distress. This has led to service reliability concerns and impacted the overall viability of the power sector.

Reforms in the distribution space have gained momentum through initiatives aimed at improving efficiency, reducing aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, and ensuring financial sustainability. Schemes promoting smart metering, feeder segregation, and prepaid billing are helping utilities improve operations and customer experience. Additionally, privatization of discoms and performance-linked incentives are being explored in several regions to enhance accountability and service quality. However, structural issues like cross-subsidization, outdated infrastructure, and limited tariff rationalization continue to hinder the progress. Moving forward, the emphasis is on digital transformation, regulatory clarity, and consumer-centric approaches to make the distribution system more robust and responsive. Technologies like artificial intelligence for load forecasting, blockchain for energy trading, and integrated energy platforms are gradually reshaping the distribution ecosystem in India.

**Generation Scenario**

India's electricity generation scenario is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a shift from conventional fossil-fuel-based sources toward a more diversified and sustainable energy mix. While coal remains a dominant player in baseload generation, there is strong policy and investment momentum around renewable energy particularly solar, wind, and hydro to enhance energy security and reduce environmental impact. Public sector utilities, private independent power producers, and state-level generators contribute to a competitive and evolving generation landscape. The focus is now expanding beyond capacity addition to include efficiency, cleaner technologies, and improved grid integration, especially as decentralized and variable sources like rooftop solar become more prevalent across rural and urban regions.

*Installed electricity generation capacity: current scenario & historical growth trends (last 5 years)*

Electricity demand in India has grown exponentially on the back of rapid urbanization, and large-scale industrialization. The two factors have increased the pool of consumers, as well as increased the per head unit consumption. This developing demand landscape have led to a rapid scale up in generation sector- with capacity addition happening across thermal, hydroelectric, nuclear, and renewable energy.

**Installed Capacity**

India's installed electricity generation capacity has shown consistent growth over the past five years, increasing from 370 GW in FY 2020 to 475 GW in FY 2025. This expansion represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.1%, underscoring the country's sustained efforts to enhance its power infrastructure in response to rising energy demand. Year-on-year additions have been steady, with capacity rising to 370 GW in FY 2020 to 475 GW in FY 2025, reflecting India's proactive approach to ensuring energy availability for industrial, commercial, and residential sectors.
