The company operates as EPC service provider in the power transmission segment. Transmission lines play a pivotal role in the electricity supply chain as they enable the efficient transfer of bulk power from generation sources, which are often located in remote areas, to substations situated closer to end-users. By operating at high voltages, they minimize energy losses during long-distance transmission, ensuring reliable and cost-effective delivery of electricity. They also provide grid stability by interconnecting different regions, allowing power to be balanced and rerouted in case of shortages or faults. Further, transmission lines are critical for integrating renewable energy projects such as solar and wind, which are typically set up in geographically isolated locations, into the main grid.\n\n➤ **Underground Cable Projects:** The company undertakes underground cabling projects for high tension (\"HT\") and low tension (\"LT\") power systems, providing comprehensive services such as trenching, cable laying, jointing, and termination.
