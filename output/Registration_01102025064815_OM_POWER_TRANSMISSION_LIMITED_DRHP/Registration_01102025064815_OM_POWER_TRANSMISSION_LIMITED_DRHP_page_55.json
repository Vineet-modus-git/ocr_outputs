A portion of these borrowings is secured by first and exclusive charge by way of hypothecation over identified receivables, hypothecation of movable assets including current assets (both present and future), fixed deposit, security cheques, investment in mutual funds and personal guarantees from the Promoters and certain members of promoter group of our Company. Our existing financing arrangements contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, without prior consents from the lenders, engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to, among other matters, change in our capital structure, ownership or shareholding pattern and in the management control of our Company, change in our ownership or capital structure where the shareholding of certain of our existing Promoters gets diluted below current levels or leads to dilution in controlling stake, any scheme of merger, amalgamation, de-merger, re-arrangement, reorganization, compromise or reconstruction by our Company or investing in third parties, change in the management or management set up of our Company or any change in the composition of our Board, management control of our Company including resignation of promoter or director, invest in, extend any advance/loans, to any group companies/associates/subsidiary/any other third party, repay subordinated loans of group companies or resort to additional borrowings without consent, any changes in the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association our Company, selling, assigning, mortgaging or disposing off any fixed assets of our Company charged with the Lendor, creating charge, lien or encumbrance over the Company's undertaking or any part thereof in favor of any financial institution, bank, company, firm or persons. If we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from the respective lenders or if any events of default occur, our lenders may accelerate the repayment schedules or terminate our credit facilities. We have applied to our lenders and we have received consents from the relevant lenders, in relation to this Offer. However, we cannot assure you that such consents will be granted in the future or at all. While there have been no such instances in the three preceding Fiscals, our failure to meet our obligations under our financing agreements could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the obligations under any of our financing agreements are accelerated, we may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments under such financing documents, thereby reducing the availability of cash for our business operations."}, {"bbox": [214, 1023, 1498, 1379], "category": "Text", "text": "Our future borrowings may also contain similar restrictive provisions. For the Financial Years ended March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, we have outstanding unsecured loans amounting to ₹ 0.85 lakhs, ₹ 193.39 lakhs, and ₹ 642.27 lakhs, respectively, from banks and other financial institutions, which are repayable on demand to them. These loans are not repayable in accordance with any agreed repayment schedule and may be recalled by the relevant lender at any time. In such cases, we may be required to repay the entirety of the unsecured loans together with accrued interest. There can be no assurance that the lenders will not recall such borrowings or if we will be able to repay loans advanced to us in a timely manner or at all. Subsequently, if we are unable to pay our debt, affected lenders could also proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Further, such covenant defaults could result in cross-defaults in our other debt financing agreements. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness."}, {"bbox": [214, 1408, 1498, 1762], "category": "Text", "text": "If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources become insufficient to pay our debt obligations or our contractual obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to sell assets or attempt to restructure or refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our creditworthiness or credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms.
