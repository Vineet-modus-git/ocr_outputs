OM POWER TRANSMISSION LIMITED (formerly known as OM POWER TRANSMISSION PRIVATE LIMITED)

Notes to the Financial Statement as at and for the year ended March 31, 2025

The Company has elected to use the exemptions proposed by the standard lease contracts for which the lease terms end within 12 months of the date of initial application, and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with such leases as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

k) Financial Instruments

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial instruments (assets and liabilities) are recognised when the Company becomes a party to a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

Financial assets (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, other than those designated as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. The amount of retention money held by the customers is disclosed as part of trade receivables.

i. Financial assets

All regular purchases or sale of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

Subsequent measurement

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets:

a) Financial assets measured at amortised cost

b) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

c) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

Financial assets measured at amortised cost

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and

• Contractual terms of the instruments give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. This category applies to cash and bank balances, trade receivables, and loans. Such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effect of the amortisation under effective interest method is recognised as interest income over the relevant period of the financial asset under other income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The amortised cost of a financial asset is also adjusted for loss allowance, if any.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

The EIR amortisation is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables, loans, etc.

Financial assets measured at FVTPL Debt instrument

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Equity investments (Equity investments other than investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates)

The Company subsequently measures all equity investments other than investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates at fair value. Where the Company's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the statement of profit and loss in the event of de-recognition.
