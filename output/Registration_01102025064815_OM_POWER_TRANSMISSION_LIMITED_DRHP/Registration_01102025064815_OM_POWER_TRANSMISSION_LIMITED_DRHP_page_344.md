47.6 Explanatory notes to the transaction from previous GAAP to Ind AS

a) Remeasurement gain/loss on defined benefit plan

b) Depreciation on Property Plant and Equipment & Investment Property

Under Indian GAAP, no depreciation was charged on Investment Property. However, under Ind AS, depreciation is required as per Ind AS 40 read with Ind AS 16. Accordingly, depreciation on Investment Property has been recognized from the date of transition to Ind AS.& error in calculating depreciation in earlier years.

c) Recognition of deferred taxes

The impact of transition adjustments together with Ind AS mandate of using balance sheet approach (against profit and loss approach under previous GAAP) for computation of deferred tax has resulted in adjustment to Reserves, with consequential impact in the subsequent periods to the State of Profit or Loss or Other Comprehensive Income, as the case may be.

d) Allowance as per expected credit loss model

As per Ind AS 109, provision has been determined based on expected credit loss model (ECL) on trade receivable.

e) Impact of accounting under Ind AS 115, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"

From the date of transition to Ind AS, the Company has applied the principles of Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and has accordingly recognized contract assets and contract liabilities in compliance with the recognition and measurement criteria prescribed under the Standard.
