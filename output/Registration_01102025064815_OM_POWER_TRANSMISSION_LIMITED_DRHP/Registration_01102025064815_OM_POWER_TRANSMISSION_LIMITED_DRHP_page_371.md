All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method or at FVTPL.

## Financial liabilities at amortised cost

After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.

## Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL when the financial liabilities are held for trading or are designated as FVTPL on initial recognition. Financial liabilities are classified as being held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.

## De-recognition

A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

### iii. Trade receivables

A receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration under the contract with a customer that is unconditional and realizable on the due date (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

### iv. Trade and other payables

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid as per agreed terms. Trade payables are presented based on the operating cycle of the Company. They are recognised initially at their transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

### v. Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the statement of assets and liabilities if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

### vi. Modification

A modification of a financial asset or liabilities occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows of a financial asset or liabilities are renegotiated or otherwise modified between initial recognition and maturity of the financial instruments. Any gain/loss on modification is charged to statement of profit and loss.

#### l) Fair Value Measurement

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

- In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefit by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset at its highest and best use.
