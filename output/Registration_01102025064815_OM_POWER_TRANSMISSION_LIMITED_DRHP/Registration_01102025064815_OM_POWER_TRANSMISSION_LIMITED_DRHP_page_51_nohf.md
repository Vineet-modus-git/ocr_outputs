may affect our reputation, standing with customers and future business, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

18. **We face certain competitive pressures from the existing competitors and new entrants in both public and private sector. Increased competition and aggressive bidding by such competitors are expected to make our ability to procure business in future more uncertain which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.**

Our business is highly competitive as we face competition from the competitors in the domestic market. For details on our listed peers, see “Basis of Offer Price- Comparison of accounting ratios with listed industry peers” on page 130. Our Company primarily procures projects on the basis of competitive bidding which entails significant managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts and at times requires us to resort to aggressive pricing to be able to be awarded the contracts. We may not be in a position to aggressively price our services in the future which may result in loss of business and adversely affect our future prospects. With increased competition, our ability to estimate costs to provide services required under the contracts and ability to deliver the project in a timely manner will determine our profitability and competitive position in the market.

The power EPC segment faces stiff competition, especially in the 132kV to 400kV range, where both national players and regional contractors aggressively participate in state and central bidding processes. Tendering norms often include stringent net worth, solvency, and past experience thresholds, which limit first-time entrants and encourage consortium or JV-based bidding strategies. L1 pricing pressures persist, but players differentiate themselves through safety compliance, manpower readiness, and ability to mobilize equipment quickly for geographically diverse projects. (Source: D&B Report.) There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors as well as new entrants in our industry in the future, or that the companies that are not directly in competition with us now will not compete with us in the future. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would be adversely and materially affected if we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage and compete successfully against our competitors and any new entrants to our industry in the future.

19. **We have experienced growth in recent years and may be unable to sustain our growth or manage it effectively. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute our growth strategies, which could affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.**

We have expanded our operations and experienced growth in recent years. Our revenue from operations grew at a CAGR of 52.45% from ₹ 12,023.63 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 27,943.51 lakhs in Fiscal 2025, based on our Restated Financial Information. Our profit for the year, calculated on the basis of our Restated Financial Information, increased from ₹622.87 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹2,208.48 lakhs in Fiscal 2025 at a CAGR of 88.17%. For further details, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Restated Financial Information” on pages 354 and 288, respectively.

As of August 31, 2025, we have undertaken 54 projects in the State of Gujarat. Sustaining our growth will require working capital investments and will also put pressure on our ability to effectively manage and control historical and emerging risks. We may not be able to sustain our growth rates due to a variety of factors such as a work stoppages, labour or social unrest, environmental activism, adverse weather conditions such as cyclones and monsoons, natural calamities, delays in construction, delays in clearances, increased cost of raw materials, unavailability of adequate funding, inability to onboard experienced members for our management team or a general slowdown in the economy or the industries in which we operate.

Our growth has placed, and continues to place, significant demands on our internal administrative infrastructure, our managerial, technical and operational capabilities as well as our financial, management and other internal risk control systems. We may not be successful in controlling our input costs, effectively managing our internal supply chain. If we are unable to complete our projects on time in line with our customer requirements with our ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction and quality standards. develop and maintain relationships with our suppliers, improve our operations and technology systems and maintain risk management standards, operate in markets or geographies where we have limited experience and preserve a uniform culture, values and work ethic in our operations.

As part of our growth strategy, we aim to further strengthen our presence by expanding our geographical footprint, enhance operational efficiency and cost management in the execution of our projects, and capitalize on the increasing demand for power transmission and distribution by actively bidding for large-scale, high-value projects across India. Our growth strategies could place significant demand on our management and our administrative, technological, operational and financial infrastructure. Any failure to sustain our growth or an expansion in the
