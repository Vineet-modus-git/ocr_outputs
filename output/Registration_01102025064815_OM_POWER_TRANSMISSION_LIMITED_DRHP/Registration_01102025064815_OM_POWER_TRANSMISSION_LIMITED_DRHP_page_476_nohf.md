161. Reserve Funds

a. The Board may, before recommending any dividends, set aside out of the profits of the Company such sums as it thinks proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Board, be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied, including provision for meeting contingencies or for equalising dividends and pending such application may, at the like discretion either be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments (other than shares of the Company) as the Board may, from time to time, think fit.

b. The Board may also carry forward any profits which it may think prudent not to divide without setting them aside as Reserve.

162. Method of payment of dividend

a. Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to share with special rights as to dividends, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares in respect whereof the dividend is paid.

b. No amount paid or credited as paid on a share in advance of calls shall be treated for the purposes of these regulations as paid on the share.

c. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid but if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividends as from a particular date, such shares shall rank for dividend accordingly.

163. Deduction of arrears

The Board may deduct from any dividend payable to any member all sums of money, if any, presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls in relation to the shares of the Company or otherwise.

164. Adjustment of dividend against call

Any General Meeting declaring a dividend or bonus may make a call on the members of such amounts as the meeting fixes, but so that the call on each member shall not exceed the dividend payable to him and so that the call be made payable at the same time as the dividend and the dividend may, if so arranged between the Company and themselves, be set off against the call.

165. Payment by cheque or warrant

a. Any dividend, interest or other moneys payable in cash in respect of shares may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through post directly to the registered address of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the registered address of that one of the joint holders who is first named in the Register of Members or to such person and to such address of the holder as the joint holders may in writing direct.

b. Every such cheque or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent.

c. Every dividend or warrant or cheque shall be posted within thirty days from the date of declaration of the dividends.

166. Retention in certain cases

The Directors may retain the dividends payable upon shares in respect of which any person is under the transmission clause entitled to become a member in respect thereof or shall duly transfer the same.
