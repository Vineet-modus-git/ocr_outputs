33. Partial payment not to preclude forfeiture

Neither a judgment nor a decree in favour of the Company for calls or other moneys due in respect of any share
nor any part payment or satisfaction thereunder, nor the receipt by the Company of a portion of any money
which shall from, time to time, be due from any member in respect of any share, either by way of principal or
interest nor any indulgency granted by the Company in respect of the payment of any such money shall preclude
the Company from thereafter proceeding to enforce a forfeiture of such shares as herein after provided.

FORFEITURE OF SHARES

34. If call or installment not paid, notice may be given

If a member fails to pay any call or installment of a call on the day appointed for the payment not paid thereof, the Board of Directors may during such time as any part of such call or installment remains unpaid serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or installment as is unpaid, together with any interest, which may have accrued. The Board may accept in the name and for the benefit of the Company and upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon, the surrender of any share liable to forfeiture and so far as the law permits of any other share.

35. Evidence action by Company against shareholders

On the trial or hearing of any action or suit brought by the Company against any shareholder or his representative to recover any debt or money claimed to be due to the Company in respect of his share, it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the defendant is or was, when the claim arose, on the Register of shareholders of the Company as a holder, or one of the holders of the number of shares in respect of which such claim is made, and that the amount claimed is not entered as paid in the books of the Company and it shall not be necessary to prove the appointment of the Directors who made any call nor that a quorum of Directors was present at the Board at which any call was made nor that the meeting at which any call was made was duly convened or constituted nor any other matter whatsoever; but the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt.

36. Form of Notice

The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of fourteen days from the date of service of the notice), on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that, in the event of non-payment on or before the day appointed, the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

37. If notice not complied with, shares may be forfeited

If the requirements of any such notice as, aforementioned are not complied with, any share in respect of which the notice has been given May at any time thereafter, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture.

38. Notice after forfeiture

When any share shall have been so forfeited, notice of the resolution shall be given to the member in whose
name it stood immediately prior to the forfeiture and an entry of the forfeiture shall not be in any manner
invalidated by any omission or neglect to give such notice or to make such entry as aforesaid.

39. Boards' right to dispose of forfeited shares or cancellation of forfeiture

A forfeited or surrendered share may be sold or otherwise disposed off on such terms and in such manner as the Board may think fit, and at any time before such a sale or disposal, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Board may think fit.

40. Liability after forfeiture

A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited shares but shall, notwithstanding such forfeiture, remain liable to pay and shall forthwith pay the Company all moneys, which at
