## Joint Ventures

Typically, we bid for projects as the sole contractor, assuming full responsibility for the entire project, including the discretion to select and supervise subcontractors as needed. However, for certain projects that demand additional expertise, local knowledge, or resources beyond our immediate availability, or where we require technical or financial expertise of local partner, we form joint ventures or consortiums with other entities in the infrastructure and construction sector for bidding for such projects.

The type of joint ventures we engage are project-specific joint ventures established to target and execute certain projects. We are responsible for project completion. However, each member's scope of work is clearly defined, along with the corresponding revenue split. For further details of our Joint Venture, see "History and Certain Corporate Matters – Our Joint Ventures" on page 255.
