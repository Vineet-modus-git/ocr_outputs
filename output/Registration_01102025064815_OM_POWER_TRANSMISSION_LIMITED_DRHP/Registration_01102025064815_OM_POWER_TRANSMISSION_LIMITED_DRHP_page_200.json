The country is naturally endowed with abundant solar radiation, wind corridors, biomass availability, small hydropower potential, and even prospects for emerging sources like offshore wind and green hydrogen. The Indian subcontinent receives high solar insolation throughout the year, making solar energy a key pillar in the country's clean energy roadmap. Similarly, regions such as the western coastal states, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and parts of central India offer strong wind profiles that have been effectively harnessed over the past two decades."}, {"bbox": [151, 1783, 1499, 1979], "category": "Text", "text": "Strategically, India's renewable energy growth is also driven by the government's proactive policies, investment incentives, and international climate commitments. Initiatives such as the National Solar Mission, Renewable Energy Development Agencies in each state, and green energy corridors aim to unlock this potential through large-scale infrastructure and capacity-building. The government is promoting hybrid projects (wind-solar), floating solar parks, and decentralized systems for rural electrification. These efforts not only diversify the energy mix but also reduce dependence on fossil fuels, mitigate carbon emissions, and contribute to energy security."}, {"bbox": [151, 2007, 1499, 2110], "category": "Text", "text": "Moreover, technological advancements and falling costs of renewable energy equipment have made projects more viable and scalable.
