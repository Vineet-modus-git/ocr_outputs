<table><tr><td>Supply, erection testing and commissioning of shifting of various 132KV, 220KV and 400KV transmission lines under Nadiad &amp; Bharuch TR circle on turnkey basis</td><td>The project involved the shifting of various transmission lines at 220 kV and 400 kV voltages to facilitate the construction of a bullet train project. This was a critical task as the high-speed bullet train route required rerouting of existing transmission lines to avoid interference with the proposed railway alignment. A total of 36 QD type towers having height of 76.00 meters, each weighing 98.00 MT, were successfully erected as part of the transmission line shifting process. The 400 kV QD-type towers were specially designed to handle the high voltage capacity and were installed with precision to ensure minimal disruption to the grid's stability and functionality.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Supply, erection, testing &amp; commissioning of 400KV D/C Mundra - Hadala LILO to Halvad line with ACSR twin moose conductor on turnkey basis.</td><td>The project involved the supply and erection of the balance work for the 400 KV SC Mundra-Hadala Line of Interconnection (LILO) to Halvad line using ACSR twin moose conductor, covering a length of 44.662 kilometers on a turnkey basis.<br/>The project was successfully completed and commissioned on November 25, 2021. The work included supply, erection, testing, and commissioning of transmission line components under a contract awarded by the state-owned transmission utility from Gujarat. The project performance to date has been satisfactory with no abnormalities reported.</td><td></td></tr></table>

The projects executed by us demonstrate our ability to manage and complete transmission line and substation projects across multiple voltage classes and locations, indicating continuity in operations, capacity to handle diverse project requirements, and consistent execution within the power transmission infrastructure sector.

### Strong Order Book across business verticals

In the industry which we operate, order book is considered as an indicator of future performance since it represents a committed portion of anticipated future revenue (Source: D&B Report).

Our Order Book and our Book to Bill ratio, for the Fiscals indicated, is as below:

<table><thead><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Fiscal 2025</td><td>Fiscal 2024</td><td>Fiscal 2023</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Order Book<br/>(&pound; in Lakhs)</td><td>44,168.85</td><td>51,560.95</td><td>20,989.09</td></tr><tr><td>Book to Bill Ratio<br/>(in times)</td><td>1.58</td><td>2.82</td><td>1.75</td></tr></tbody></table>

As of August 31, 2025, our Order Book consisted of 56 projects aggregating to ₹77,619.35 lakhs. The growth of our Order Book over the last three Fiscals has contributed to the scale-up of our operations and provided revenue visibility. The consistent growth in our Order Book is a result of our execution track record, our focus on maintaining quality standards in our construction and project execution skills. Until Fiscal 2025, our projects were executed entirely within the State of Gujarat, where we have built a strong track record. In line with our strategy to diversify geographically, we have recently forayed into other states, having secured an EPC contract for transmission lines in the State of Punjab and a substation EPC project in the State of Rajasthan. Diversifying our Order Book across different geographical regions, enables us to pursue a broader range of project tenders and therefore maximize our business volume and profit margins.

Our Order Book is diversified across business verticals. Transmission line EPC projects constitute the largest share,
