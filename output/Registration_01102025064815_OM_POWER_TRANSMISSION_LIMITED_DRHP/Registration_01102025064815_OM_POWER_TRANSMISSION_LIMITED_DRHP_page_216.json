In some cases, prolonged uncertainty may also result in project cancellation or penalty imposition due to missed deadlines.\n\n*   **Credit Access Constraints for Smaller EPC Firms:** Credit access remains a critical constraint for smaller and mid-sized EPC firms in the power infrastructure sector. Due to perceived financial risk and limited credit histories, banks and NBFCs are often reluctant to provide project finance or working capital to these players. This restricts their ability to bid for large-scale tenders that require substantial bank guarantees and performance securities. Even when loans are sanctioned, the interest rates tend to be higher and disbursement slower, impacting cash flow and operational agility. As a result, many capable EPC firms are unable to scale or compete effectively, limiting industry competitiveness and innovation.\n*   **Climate and Extreme Weather Risks:** Climate change and extreme weather events are emerging as significant risks for EPC firms in the power infrastructure sector. The rising frequency of floods, cyclones, and heatwaves particularly in coastal and arid regions can disrupt construction schedules, damage partially completed assets, and increase downtime. These events not only delay project timelines but also inflate insurance premiums and mitigation costs. Moreover, the unpredictability of weather patterns complicates site planning, logistics, and resource allocation. EPC firms are increasingly required to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and adaptive project designs, adding to upfront costs and execution complexity.\n*   **Intellectual Property & Technology Risks:** As digital technologies like SCADA, AI-driven analytics, and remote O&M become integral to power EPC projects, the industry is increasingly exposed to intellectual property (IP) and technology-related risks. Dependence on third-party technology providers can lead to vulnerabilities such as IP disputes, licensing restrictions, and compatibility issues. Additionally, rapid tech evolution risks making proprietary systems or tools obsolete, particularly for firms with limited R&D capacity. Cybersecurity is another concern, as digital platforms handling critical infrastructure data are prone to breaches. These factors pose legal, operational, and reputational risks for EPC companies relying heavily on digital integration."}, {"bbox": [152, 1063, 298, 1099], "category": "Section-header", "text": "Challenges:"}, {"bbox": [298, 1117, 1348, 1632], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [150, 1669, 1501, 2094], "category": "List-item", "text": "*   **Balancing Standardization with Customization:** In the power EPC space, achieving a balance between standardized designs and client-specific customization is a persistent challenge. While standardization enables cost efficiency, quicker execution, and streamlined procurement, clients often demand modifications tailored to site-specific conditions, regulatory requirements, or unique technical needs. This divergence can lead to repeated design iterations, longer engineering timelines, and increased coordination between design and execution teams. Additionally, in geographically diverse and topographically challenging areas, customization becomes unavoidable, thereby reducing the benefits of economies of scale. Such complexities frequently contribute to delays, cost overruns, and stretched project cycles.\n*   **Short Bid-to-Award Timelines:** Short bid-to-award timelines in public sector tenders often pressure EPC firms to prepare proposals with minimal due diligence. With limited time to assess site conditions, regulatory requirements, or material costs, firms may make inaccurate assumptions in pricing and planning. This rushed process increases the risk of underbidding, scope misalignment, or overlooking key execution challenges. As a result, project timelines and"}]
