These obligations often extend 5-10 years beyond project handover, requiring sustained technical support, spare parts availability, and performance monitoring. However, such responsibilities are not always matched with adequate margins or risk buffers in the contract. Any shortfall in plant performance or service disruptions can lead to penalties, reputational damage, or financial losses making this a critical challenge in the evolving EPC contract landscape.\n\n➤ **Fragmentation in Subcontracting Ecosystem:** Fragmentation in the subcontracting ecosystem is a persistent challenge for EPC firms in the power infrastructure sector. Projects often rely on multiple subcontractors for specialized tasks such as civil works, electrical installations, and equipment commissioning. Poor coordination among these parties can lead to scheduling conflicts, duplication of effort, and missed deadlines. Additionally, a fragmented vendor base makes it difficult to maintain uniform quality standards and enforce accountability, especially in remote or high-volume project sites. These inefficiencies not only impact project timelines and costs but also pose risks to safety and compliance. Strengthening vendor management systems is essential to address this issue."}, {"bbox": [151, 807, 440, 842], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Competitive Landscape"}, {"bbox": [151, 871, 1499, 1102], "category": "Text", "text": "The EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) segment within India's Power Infrastructure domain is undergoing rapid transformation, with increasing private sector participation complementing the long-standing dominance of public sector utilities and large conglomerates.
