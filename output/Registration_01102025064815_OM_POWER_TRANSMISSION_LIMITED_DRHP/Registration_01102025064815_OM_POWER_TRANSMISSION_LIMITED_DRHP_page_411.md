2014, as amended, the sole Bidder, or the First Bidder along with other joint Bidders, may nominate any one person in whom, in the event of the death of sole Bidder or in case of joint Bidders, death of all the Bidders, as the case may be, the Equity Shares Allotted, if any, shall vest, to the exclusion of all other persons, unless the nomination is modified or cancelled in the prescribed manner. A person, being a nominee, entitled to the Equity Shares by reason of the death of the original holder(s), shall be entitled to the same advantages to which he or she would be entitled if he or she were the registered holder of the Equity Share(s). Where the nominee is a minor, the holder(s) may make a nomination to appoint, in the prescribed manner, any person to become entitled to Equity Share(s) in the event of his or her death during the minority. A nomination shall stand rescinded upon a sale, transfer or alienation of Equity Share(s) by the holder of such Equity Share(s). A nomination may be cancelled or modified by nominating any other person in place of the present nominee, by the holder of the Equity Shares who has made the nomination, by giving a notice of such cancellation or variation to our Company in the prescribed form. Fresh nomination can be made only on the prescribed form available on request at our Registered and Corporate Office or at the registrar and transfer agents of our Company.

Further, any person who becomes a nominee by virtue of Section 72 of the Companies Act, 2013, will, on the production of such evidence as may be required by the Board, elect either:

* to register himself or herself as holder of the Equity Shares; or

* to make such transfer of the Equity Shares, as the deceased holder could have made.

Further, our Board may, at any time give notice requiring any nominee to choose either to be registered himself or herself or to transfer the Equity Shares, and if the notice is not complied with within a period of 90 days, the Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividend, interests, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the Equity Shares, until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

Since the Allotment of Equity Shares in the Offer will be made only in dematerialized form, there is no need to make a separate nomination with our Company. Nominations registered with the respective Depository Participant of the Bidder will prevail. If Bidders want to change their nomination, they are advised to inform their respective Depository Participant.

Our Company shall comply with such disclosure and accounting norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time.
