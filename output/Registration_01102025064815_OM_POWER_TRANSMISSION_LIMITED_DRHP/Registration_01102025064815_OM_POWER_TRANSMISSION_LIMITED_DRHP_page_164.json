Even as demand surged year after year, the shortfall remained marginal and continued to shrink. Notably, in **FY 2026 (up to May)**, the deficit stood at just **0.1 BU**, pointing to a near-balanced power scenario. This performance underscores India's progress toward achieving energy adequacy, ensuring uninterrupted supply, and reducing regional and seasonal shortages. It reflects the success of sustained investments in power generation, particularly in renewables, along with better demand forecasting and grid management."}, {"bbox": [155, 1828, 1497, 1987], "category": "Text", "text": "India's peak electricity demand has seen a steady upward trajectory in recent years, driven by rising consumption across residential, industrial, and commercial sectors. From 183.8 GW in FY 2020, the country's peak demand increased to 249.9 GW in FY 2025, reflecting a CAGR of 6.3% over the five-year period. This robust growth mirrors the country's broader economic expansion, increased electrification, and higher appliance and cooling loads, especially during summer months."}]
