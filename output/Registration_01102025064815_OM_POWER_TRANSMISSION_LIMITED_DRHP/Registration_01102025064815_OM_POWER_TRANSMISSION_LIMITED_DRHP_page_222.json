In addition to the line construction, two 400 kV dwarf towers were erected, designed to facilitate the underneath crossing of a 500 kV HVDC line.<br/>These towers, engineered by one of the suppliers engaged in engineering sector, were customized to navigate the challenges posed by the existing high-voltage infrastructure. The project was executed in challenging terrain and environmental conditions, demonstrating our company's ability to meet stringent timelines and overcome technical hurdles while ensuring the reliability and safety of the transmission network.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Supply, erection testing and commissioning of shifting of various 132KV, 220KV and 400KV transmission lines under Nadiad & Bharuch TR circle on turnkey basis</td><td>The project involved the shifting of various transmission lines at 220 kV and 400 kV voltages to facilitate the construction of a bullet train project. This was a critical task as the high-speed bullet train route required rerouting of existing transmission lines to avoid interference with the proposed railway alignment. A total of 36 QD type towers having height of 76.00 meters, each weighing 98.00 MT, were successfully erected as part of the transmission line shifting process. The 400 kV QD-type towers were specially designed to handle the high voltage capacity and were installed with precision to ensure minimal disruption to the grid's stability and functionality.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [1482, 285, 2161, 857], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1472, 878, 2161, 1383], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1140, 1481, 1192, 1511], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "218"}]
