Section 115BAA grants an option to a domestic company to be governed by the section from a particular assessment year. If a company opts for section 115BAA of the Act, it can pay corporate tax at a reduced rate of 25.168% (22% plus surcharge of 10% and education cess of 4%). Section 115BAA of the Act further provides that domestic companies availing the option will not be required to pay Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") on their 'book profits' under section 115JB of the Act.
