Financial turmoil in Asia, Europe, the United States and elsewhere in the world in recent years has affected the Indian economy. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investors' reactions to developments in one country can have a material adverse effect on the securities of companies in other countries, including India. A loss in investor confidence in the financial systems of other emerging markets may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets and, indirectly, in the Indian economy in general. Any global financial instability, including continued volatility in global financial markets due to the economic slowdown in China and the increase in the federal interest rates by the United States Federal Reserve, could also have a negative impact on the Indian financial markets and economy."}, {"bbox": [156, 836, 1186, 870], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**78.

In order to be enforceable, a judgment from a jurisdiction with reciprocity must meet certain requirements of the Indian Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “Civil Code”). The Civil Code only permits the enforcement of monetary decrees, not being in the nature of any amounts payable in respect of taxes, other charges, fines or penalties. Judgments or decrees from jurisdictions which do not have reciprocal recognition with India cannot be enforced by proceedings in execution in India. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in a non-reciprocating territory for civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the general laws of the non-reciprocating territory, would not be enforceable in India. Even if an investor obtained a judgment in such a jurisdiction against us, our officers or directors, it may be required to institute a new proceeding in India and obtain a decree from an Indian court. However, the party in whose favour such final judgment is rendered may bring a fresh suit in a competent court in India based on a final judgment that has been obtained in a non-reciprocating territory within three years of obtaining such final judgment. It is unlikely that an Indian court would award damages on the same basis or to the same extent as was awarded in a final judgment rendered by a court in another jurisdiction if the Indian court believed that the amount of damages awarded was excessive or inconsistent with public policy in India. In addition, any person seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India is required to obtain prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to the execution of the judgment."}, {"bbox": [156, 1670, 1495, 1737], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**79.
