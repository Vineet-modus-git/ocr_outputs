Over recent years, the country has focused on harnessing renewable resources such as solar, wind, and biomass, leading to a significant transformation in its energy landscape. The installed capacity for renewable energy in India has demonstrated impressive growth. As of FY 2025, India's total installed power generation capacity reached approximately 475 GW, with renewable energy sources (excluding large hydro) accounting for about 46% of this total capacity. This marks a significant milestone in the country's renewable energy journey, highlighting the nation's growing commitment to sustainable energy. India's renewable energy capacity, which includes solar, wind, biomass, and small hydro, has surpassed 220 GW. Notably, solar energy capacity exceeded 100 GW by FY 2025, while wind energy also experienced substantial growth, reaching over 48 GW."}, {"bbox": [153, 1695, 1498, 1890], "category": "Text", "text": "India globally ranks 4th in Renewable Energy Installed Capacity, 4th in Wind Power Capacity, and 5th in Solar Power Capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency's 'Renewable Capacity Statistics 2023.'
