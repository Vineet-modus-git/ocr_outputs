**Growth in Economic Activity & Industrialization:** India's power demand is being significantly propelled by sustained economic growth and industrial expansion. In FY 2025, India's real GDP grew by 6.5% while nominal GDP rose by 9.8%, supported by robust sectors like construction and manufacturing. The construction sector alone grew around 9.4%, reflecting heightened infrastructure activity that drives demand for reliable electricity.

Meanwhile, the Central Electricity Authority's 20th Electric Power Survey forecasts India's peak demand to reach approximately 366 GW by FY 2031-32, and energy requirement to grow to about 2,473 BU a significant increase from nearly 1,852 BU projected for FY 2026-27. These projections underscore accelerating demand from industrial corridors, manufacturing zones, commercial complexes, and urban agglomerations. The policy emphasis on infrastructure and industrialization such as the development of industrial clusters, economic zones, and capacity expansion in manufacturing further amplifies electricity requirements.

**Agricultural Power Demand:** India's power demand is significantly influenced by its agrarian economy, where irrigation pump sets and rural mechanization contribute heavily to electricity consumption, thereby creating targeted opportunities for EPC firms in rural power systems and solar infrastructure. According to the Central Electricity Authority, agriculture accounted for approximately 16.53% of total electricity consumption in FY 2024. To reduce diesel dependency, enhance water and energy security and supplement farmers' income, the government rolled out the PM-KUSUM scheme under the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy.

Approved in March 2019 and extended to March 2026, this flagship program aims to deploy 34,800 MW of solar capacity across three components: decentralized solar plants (Component A), standalone solar pumps (Component B), and grid-connected pump solarization (Component C). This electrification and solarization efforts are expanding decentralized energy access in rural areas, while simultaneously boosting EPC demand particularly for off-grid solar projects, rural substations, and feeder-level distribution upgrades integrated with agricultural electrification.

**Urbanization and Population Growth Driving Electricity Demand:** Rapid urbanization and demographic growth are significantly elevating electricity demand in India's urban and peri-urban regions. According to the Government of India's *Handbook of Urban Statistics*, With India's urban population projected to reach 600 million by 2036 (≈40% of the total population), cities are becoming epicentres of electricity consumption. These urban centres expected to contribute nearly 75% of India's GDP are placing increasing demands on power distribution networks, substations, and monitoring systems, necessitating large-scale infrastructure upgrades.

Urban growth is intensifying electricity consumption across residential complexes, commercial centres, transportation nodes, and civic amenities. To meet this surge in demand, government programs such as the Smart Cities Mission and urban electrification policies are scaling investments into advanced power infrastructure such as underground cabling, automated substations, real-time monitoring systems, and SCADA networks creating a steady demand pipeline for EPC projects in urban power modernization.

**Government Electrification Initiatives and Flagship Policies:** India's mission to ensure 24×7 electricity access for all is built on a series of sequential electrification programs. These flagship government schemes have progressively expanded the reach and quality of power infrastructure across rural and urban India:

* **Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY)** – Launched prior to 2017, this scheme focused on rural electrification through the strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution infrastructure. Over **18,374 villages** were electrified under this program.
* **Saubhagya (Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana)** – Introduced in **2017**, it targeted household-level electrification. By **March 2022**, it enabled power connections to over **2.86 crore** rural and urban households, delivering last-mile grid connectivity and meter installations.
* **Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS)** – Approved in **2021**, this ongoing program has a total outlay of **INR 3.03 lakh crore**, including **INR 97,631 crore** in budgetary support. RDSS focuses on smart metering, feeder separation, distribution network strengthening, and grid reliability improvements continuing the electrification momentum while addressing AT&C losses.

This phased and layered approach to electrification has not only expanded power access but also created sustained opportunities for EPC players across grid extension, substation development, and smart metering rollouts.
