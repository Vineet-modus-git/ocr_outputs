Accounting Classifications & Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are measured at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

All financial instruments are initially recognized and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below :

1. The fair value of investment in quoted equity shares and mutual funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.

2. Fair values of cash and short term deposits, trade and other short term receivables, trade payables, other current liabilities, short term loans from banks and other financial institutions approximate their carrying amounts largely due to short-term maturities of these instruments.

3. Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on the evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected losses of these receivables.

The company uses the following hierarchy for determining and

Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for Financial Instruments.

Level 2 : The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

Level 3 - If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

Summary of assets and liabilities which are measured at amortised cost and which are measured at fair values are disclosed below:
