Tariffs and their unpredictable application have weighed on consumer and business sentiment, sunk global stock markets, raised recession risks, and made a global slowdown more likely. Our latest Global Business Optimism Insights report for indicates a further decline in business optimism as firms continue to grapple with trade-related policy uncertainty and its broader economic implications. Export-driven sectors reported sharp declines in optimism. Financial risk perceptions remain elevated as businesses contend with high borrowing costs and persistent inflation expectations. More broadly, the uncertainty is reflected in delayed capital expenditure and a pullback in hiring.

Tariffs have begun to exert pressure on central banks by contributing to inflationary pressures and increasing financial market volatility. Central banks are adjusting forward guidance and policy frameworks and may begin to consider the likelihood of softer growth being a bigger priority than high inflation by starting to cut interest rates to support economies. For businesses, this uncertainty translates into unpredictable cost structures, fluctuating credit availability, and the management of operational costs through diversified supply networks.

The latest Dun & Bradstreet Global Business Optimism Insights report reveals a further decline in business optimism, though at a more moderate pace than in the prior quarter, as businesses continued to grapple with trade-related policy uncertainty and its broader economic implications. Export-driven sectors such as automotives, electricals, and metals saw sharp declines in optimism, particularly in the U.S., Mexico, South Korea, and Japan, where rising tariffs and shifting trade policies have fueled cost pressures and demand volatility. Financial risk perceptions remain elevated.

## Global Growth Projection

At broader level, the global economy is expected to experience a slowdown in 2025, with GDP growth projected to decline to 3.0%, down from 3.3% in 2024. This deceleration reflects persistent inflationary pressure, geopolitical uncertainties and tightened monetary policies. However, a slightly recovery is anticipated in 2026, with growth projected to improve to 3.1%. Global inflation is expected to decline steadily, to 4.2% in 2025 and to 3.6% in 2026. Inflation is projected to converge back to the target earlier in advanced economies, reaching 2.2% in 2026, whereas in emerging market and developing economies, it is anticipated to decrease to 4.6% during the same period. Trade tariffs function as a supply shock for the countries imposing them, leading to a decrease in productivity and an increase in unit costs. Countries subject to tariffs experience a negative demand shock as export demand declines, placing downward pressure on prices. In each scenario, trade uncertainty introduces an additional layer of demand shock since businesses and households react by delaying investment and spending, and this impact could be intensified by stricter financial conditions and heightened exchange rate volatility. Moreover, Global trade growth is expected to slow down in 2025 to 1.7%. This forecast reflects increased tariff restrictions affecting trade flows and, to a lesser extent, the waning effects of cyclical factors that have underpinned the recent rise in goods trade. Geopolitical tensions as seen in the past such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could exacerbate inflation volatility, particularly in energy and agricultural commodities.
