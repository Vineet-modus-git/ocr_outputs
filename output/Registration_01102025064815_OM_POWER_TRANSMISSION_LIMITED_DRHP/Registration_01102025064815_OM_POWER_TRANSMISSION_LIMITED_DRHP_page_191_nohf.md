**Growth in Renewable Energy Capacity:** India has reached a major milestone in its clean energy transition, with non-fossil fuel sources now accounting for over 50% of the country's total installed electricity capacity a target achieved five years ahead of the 2030 deadline, as confirmed by the Government of India in July 2025. As of June 30, 2025, total installed capacity stood at 484.82 GW, of which 242.78 GW (50.08%) came from non-fossil sources, including renewables (184.62 GW), large hydro (49.38 GW) and nuclear (8.78 GW). This landmark achievement underscores the impact of flagship programs such as PM-KUSUM, solar parks, and the National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy, which have driven exponential growth in solar, wind, and bioenergy segments.

During FY 2025 alone, India added a record 29.52 GW of renewable energy capacity, led by solar (23.83 GW) and wind (4.15 GW). The clean energy project pipeline remains robust, with 169.40 GW under implementation and 65.06 GW tendered, including hybrid, RTC, and peaking projects. These developments are generating sustained EPC demand across generation, transmission, and storage infrastructure as India moves confidently toward its 500 GW non-fossil target for 2030.

**Modernization Efforts - Smart Grids and Digital Infrastructure:** India's power distribution grid is being transformed through digital modernization initiatives primarily the National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) under the oversight of the Ministry of Power. RDSS, which carries an outlay of approximately INR 3.03 lakh crore, aims to install 250 million prepaid smart meters by March 2026.

As of mid-July 2025, 20.33 crore smart meters have been sanctioned under the scheme, with 2.41 crore installed to date, including 2.27 crore already deployed across 28 states/UTs. Installation rates have accelerated from about 11,000-12,000 meters/day to nearly 80,000/day a significant scale-up in execution speed. These efforts are supported by NSGM-led pilots and RE/SCADA integration projects, and are reinforcing infrastructure modernization via smart metering, feeder-level monitoring, and substation automation creating expansive EPC demand for grid digitization.

**Regulatory Landscape: Power Transmission & Distribution Segment**

India's Power Transmission and Distribution (T&D) segment operates within a dynamic regulatory ecosystem that significantly influences infrastructure growth, grid modernization, and private sector participation. This framework guided by central and state regulatory bodies has evolved through key policy interventions aimed at enhancing grid reliability, financial sustainability of DISCOMs, and broadening electricity access nationwide. The sector is highly regulated, with various functions being distributed between multiple implementing agencies. The three chief regulators are: the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs). The Ministry of Power (MoP) works in close coordination with the CERC and CEA. While the CERC's role is more of a regulator for approving tariffs of central utilities, approving licenses, etc., the CEA is primarily a technical advisor focused on planning, i.e., estimating power demand and generation and transmission capacity.
