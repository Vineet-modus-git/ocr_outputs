assurance that such material cost escalations will not arise in the future, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

9. Our actual cost incurred in completing a project may vary substantially from the assumptions underlying our bid. We may be unable to recover all or some of the additional expenses incurred, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.

Under our contracts with our customers, we are typically entitled to receive an agreed amount, subject to variations in our scope of work. This amount is based on certain estimates underlying our bid including cost of construction materials, fuel, labour, sub-contracting costs or other inputs, and construction conditions. However, our actual expenses in executing a project may vary based on a change in any such assumptions. The cost of construction materials, fuel, labour, transportation, freight, and right-of-way, for which our Company typically bears substantial liability in private sector contracts, constitutes a substantial portion of our operating expenses.

We are vulnerable to the risk of rising and fluctuating fuel, labour, steel, cement, conductor, tower material, and reinforcement prices, which are determined by demand and supply conditions in the global and Indian markets as well as government policies. While escalation in construction costs for a majority of these commodities is generally covered under government contracts, in the case of private sector contracts we are typically required to absorb such increases under the fixed contract price. Any unexpected price fluctuations after placement of orders, shortage, delay in delivery, quality defects, or any factors beyond our control may result in an interruption in the supply of such materials and adversely affect our business, financial performance, results of operations, and cash flows. While we have not experienced any material adverse impact from such price fluctuations in the last three fiscal years, there can be no assurance that we will not face such risks in the future.

If our cost overruns are greater than the increase in market rates, we may not be able to recover all of our cost overruns. Further, some of our fixed-price contracts do not include any price variation or escalation clauses, in which case we bear the entire risk of price increases. Similarly, we may have to bear cost overrun for any new business vertical that we may venture into in the future. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any cost overruns in the future. The total number of contracts where the cost overrun (excluding contractually acceptable price variations and escalation) exceeds 10%, 20%, and 30% of the estimated cost, along with the value of such projects, for the periods indicated, is as follows:
