The claim pertains to the non-payment for supply, installation, testing and commissioning of a 220 KV transmission line with AL 59 Zebra conductor and optical ground wire, supplied during the period from May 14, 2018 to June 27, 2020, with payment terms of 45 days from the date of invoice. The Buyer, while acknowledging the principal outstanding amount of ₹ 104.92 lakhs, did not provide reasons for the delay in payment. The MSEFC vide notice dated May 16, 2025 directed our Company to complete offline procedural formalities including submission of notarised and chartered accountant-certified annexures, supporting invoices, delivery challans, purchase orders and financial statements. Subsequently, the Council issued a notice dated November 21, 2024 to the Buyer, directing it to respond within seven days with details of quantities purchased, payments made and reasons for outstanding amounts, failing which the matter would proceed ex parte.
