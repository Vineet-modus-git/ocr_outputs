## Execution and Monitoring

We create project-wise budgets, assessing past expenditures and analysing financial trends to estimate budget requirements.

During this time, we are responsible for curing any defects that may arise out of the quality of construction materials used or workmanship.

The retention money or bank guarantee is typically 5 – 10% of the contract value.
