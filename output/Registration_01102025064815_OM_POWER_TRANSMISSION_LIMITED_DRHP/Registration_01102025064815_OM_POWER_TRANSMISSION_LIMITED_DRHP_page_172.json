They operate equipment like induction motors, compressors, and CNC machines that require significant electrical input. These consumers often install in-house transformers to step down voltage to usable levels. They are billed under industrial tariffs with demand-based charges.\n* **Urban Distribution Substations:** Urban localities are supplied via 11kV or 33kV feeders that step down to low voltage at pole-mounted or ground-mounted transformers. These substations serve a cluster of households, offices, or apartment complexes. They form the primary backbone of the urban electricity distribution network. Utility engineers can remotely control breakers and isolators at these substations for load management.\n* **Large Educational and Government Campuses:** Universities, railway stations, airports, and administrative offices often require 11kV or 33kV connections due to the scale of operations. Centralized distribution and energy monitoring help manage multiple buildings from a single control point. Energy usage in such facilities spans HVAC systems, lifts, IT infrastructure, and heavy lighting.\n* **Feeder Separation in Agriculture:** Under schemes like Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), agricultural and non-agricultural loads are separated using 11kV feeders. This prevents overloading of rural grids during peak irrigation hours and ensures better voltage regulation for domestic users. These dedicated feeders also help in time-controlled supply and reducing AT&C losses.\n* **Mini-Industrial Parks and Export Zones:** Export processing zones and mini-industrial estates are supplied with 33kV power to ensure quality and uninterrupted supply. These zones may be developed under state industrial infrastructure schemes. Each industrial unit has its metered connection, but the bulk supply is received at a single switchyard."}]
