Additionally, the expansion of industries, particularly in manufacturing, cement, steel, and textiles, has significantly fuelled industrial demand. The rapid pace of urbanization, along with increasing appliance ownership and evolving consumption patterns, has further driven higher electricity usage in residential sectors. Despite these advancements, India's per capita electricity consumption remains considerably lower than that of many developed nations, largely due to its vast population and diverse socio-economic conditions."}, {"bbox": [155, 1217, 687, 1253], "category": "Text", "text": "## Electricity demand v/s supply scenario in India"}, {"bbox": [155, 1282, 1498, 1510], "category": "Text", "text": "India's electricity demand has grown steadily over recent years, reflecting increased industrial activity, urbanization, and rural electrification. Between FY 2020 and FY 2025, the total energy requirement rose from 1,291 BU to 1,694 BU, registering a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.6% on the back of strong economic growth, expanding infrastructure, and higher consumption across residential and industrial segments. This consistent rise highlights the expanding energy needs of the country's growing economy. In parallel, electricity supply has kept pace, improving significantly in both volume and reliability. For instance, while the supply in FY 2020 was 1,284.4 BU, it increased to 1,692.4 BU by FY 2025, resulting in a sharp decline in the power deficit from 6.6 BU to just 1.6 BU over the same period."}]
