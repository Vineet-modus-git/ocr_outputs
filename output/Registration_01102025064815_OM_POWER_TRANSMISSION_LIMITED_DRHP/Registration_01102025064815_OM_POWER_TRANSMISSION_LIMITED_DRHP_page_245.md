## Competition

The power EPC segment faces stiff competition, especially in the 132kV to 400kV range, where both national players and regional contractors aggressively participate in state and central bidding processes. Tendering norms often include stringent net worth, solvency, and past experience thresholds, which limit first-time entrants and encourage consortium or JV-based bidding strategies. LI pricing pressures persist, but players differentiate themselves through safety compliance, manpower readiness, and ability to mobilize equipment quickly for geographically diverse projects. Our competitors are Rajesh Power Services Limited, Advait Energy Transitions Limited and Viviana Power Tech Limited (Source: D&B Report.)

## Customers

We have a diverse customer base comprising Public Sector Undertakings (“PSUs”) and private sector clients, all of whom are engaged in power generation (including renewable energy), transmission and distribution, and civil construction. We undertake Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (“EPC”) as well as Operation & Maintenance (“O&M”) projects for these clients.
