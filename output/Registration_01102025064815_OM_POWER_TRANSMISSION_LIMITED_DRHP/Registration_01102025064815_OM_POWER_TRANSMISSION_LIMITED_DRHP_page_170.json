EHV lines facilitate bulk evacuation of renewable power, ensuring it can be delivered to load centres hundreds of kilometres away without significant losses.\n*   **Integration of Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPPs):** EHV infrastructure supports the evacuation of electricity generated by UMPPs and other large generating stations. By stepping up power directly to 400 kV or 765 kV, these projects achieve efficient long-distance transmission. Dedicated EHV lines link UMPPs to state and regional grids, helping meet base-load requirements.\n*   **High-Capacity Industrial Corridors and Dedicated Freight Corridors:** India's upcoming industrial belts and freight corridors demand uninterrupted, high-capacity power. EHV lines supply these strategic projects with stable electricity, supporting large-scale manufacturing, metro rail systems, and logistics infrastructure that cannot risk outages.\n*   **HVDC Bi-Directional Power Flow:** Alongside AC networks, ±500 kV and ±800 kV HVDC corridors are deployed for secure and bi-directional long-distance transmission. These systems are used to connect hydro-dominated regions like the North-East to demand centres in Northern and Western India, improving flexibility and stability of the grid.\n*   **System Reliability and Emergency Support:** EHV lines provide redundancy during contingencies, allowing rerouting of power when lower-voltage transmission paths are overloaded or unavailable. This ensures grid stability during peak demand, plant outages, or maintenance shutdowns."}, {"bbox": [154, 942, 444, 979], "category": "Section-header", "text": "➤ **High Voltage (HV):**"}, {"bbox": [222, 974, 1430, 1618], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [615, 1639, 1037, 1675], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: Central Electricity Authority"}, {"bbox": [154, 1704, 1498, 1900], "category": "Text", "text": "High voltage transmission in India generally covers the 66 kV to 132 kV range, which acts as a critical link between extra-high voltage (EHV) backbones and medium-voltage sub-transmission networks. These lines are designed to transfer sizeable quantities of power over moderate distances, helping step down from bulk interstate transfers to state-level and regional demand centres. The 66 kV level typically functions as a transition point between sub-transmission and higher-voltage transmission, while 132 kV and its variants (110 kV, 90 kV) are more widely deployed across state grids for feeding distribution substations."}, {"bbox": [154, 1929, 1498, 2123], "category": "Text", "text": "As per the Central Electricity Authority's records, the total length of HV transmission lines has steadily expanded over recent years. At the 132/110/90 kV level, line length rose from 2,10,269 circuit kilometres in FY 2020 to 2,36,593 circuit kilometres by FY 2023. Similarly, 66/78 kV lines increased from 71,285 circuit kilometres in FY 2020 to 76,669 circuit kilometres in FY 2023. This consistent addition underscores the importance of HV lines in strengthening intra-state transmission, balancing regional demand, and ensuring reliable connectivity between generating stations and urban/industrial load centres."}]
