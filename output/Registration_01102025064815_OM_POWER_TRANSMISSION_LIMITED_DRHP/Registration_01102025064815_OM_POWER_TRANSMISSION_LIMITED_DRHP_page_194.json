In line with its international climate commitments and rising domestic energy demand, the Government of India has introduced a range of flagship schemes and policy frameworks to enhance installed capacity across diverse energy sources. These initiatives not only aim to accelerate clean energy deployment but also drive industrial growth, job creation, and energy security. Key government interventions span across large-scale solar deployment, rooftop solar access, solar-powered agriculture, small modular reactors, and incentives for domestic equipment manufacturing all of which collectively form the backbone of India's energy transition."}, {"bbox": [150, 807, 1206, 845], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (NSM) & Ultra Mega Solar Park Scheme:"}, {"bbox": [150, 874, 1499, 1102], "category": "Text", "text": "Launched on 11 January 2010, the NSM aimed first at 20 GW solar capacity by 2022 and was revised in 2015 to reach 100 GW (40 GW rooftop + 60 GW utility-scale) through central and state efforts, under the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE).
