electricity grid in that area, we cannot assure you that the relevant government or public entity will upgrade the grid infrastructure in a timely manner, or at all, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the power transmission infrastructure and distribution industry in that area, and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Moreover, delays or inefficiencies in the upgrade and maintenance of transmission infrastructure can lead to significant bottlenecks, resulting in the inability to deliver generated power to the grid. Such situations can cause operational disruptions and financial losses due to unutilized capacity and contractual penalties for non-supply of power. While any operational disruptions or financial losses arising from unutilized capacity or contractual penalties for non-supply of power are typically borne by the DISCOM and not our Company, such situations may still impact the timing and flow of our project operations.

Furthermore, the lack of a robust and extensive transmission network can lead to increased reliance on alternative and potentially more expensive solutions, such as localized storage systems or private transmission arrangements, further escalating operational costs. The dependence on state-operated transmission networks also introduces regulatory risks, as changes in government policies, delays in regulatory approvals, or political instability can directly affect grid access and operational efficiency.

While in the last three fiscals, our business has not been materially adversely affected by the availability of the electricity grid in an area. However, any future constraints in the availability of the electricity grid, including access to transmission lines in a timely and cost-effective manner, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**38. Our business is exposed to sectoral, regulatory and market risks in the EPC industry, which could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability, and growth prospects.**

Regulatory Uncertainty poses a significant threat to EPC projects in India's power sector. Frequent amendments to environmental regulations, land acquisition rules, and grid connectivity procedures often lead to delays in project approvals and cost escalations. These uncertainties are particularly challenging for long-gestation projects like transmission lines or large-scale renewable parks, where planning is done years in advance (Source: D&B Report). The lack of consistency in regulations can also deter private investment and complicate financial closure, thereby exposing EPC contractors, including our Company, to heightened compliance risks and uncertainty in project execution.

Commodity price fluctuations represent another significant risk. Infrastructure projects rely heavily on materials like steel, copper, aluminum, and cement. Sudden spikes in global or domestic commodity prices can sharply erode project margins, particularly for fixed-price contracts that do not incorporate robust escalation clauses. EPC firms often operate on thin profit margins and long project cycles, making them vulnerable to such cost shocks (Source: D&B Report). Supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and changes in import duties may further amplify input cost volatility. Without adequate contractual protections or hedging mechanisms, our Company may be forced to absorb losses, which could adversely affect our financial stability and future bidding capacity.

Payment Delays from DISCOMs remain a persistent challenge for EPC firms executing power infrastructure projects. Many state-owned distribution companies (DISCOMs) face chronic financial distress due to high Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses, under-recovery of power costs, and inefficiencies in billing and collection. These issues often translate into delayed payments to contractors, even when projects are completed on time. For EPC firms, such delays disrupt working capital cycles, strain liquidity, and increase reliance on short-term borrowing raising overall project risk. Despite government reforms like the RDSS aimed at improving DISCOM performance, payment reliability remains inconsistent across states, posing a material risk to contractors' financial health and operational continuity (Source: D&B Report). Such delays can disrupt working capital cycles, strain liquidity, and increase reliance on short-term borrowing, exposing our Company to higher financial and operational risks.

While we have not experienced material delays, cost escalations, or payment defaults from customers in the last three Fiscals, there can be no assurance that such risks will not arise in the future, and any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

**39. Complexity in project execution in remote and challenging terrains may adversely affect timelines and costs.**

Project execution complexity is a fundamental challenge in the power EPC segment, as projects are often spread across remote, diverse, and logistically difficult terrains (Source: D&B Report). Executing large-scale infrastructure in such regions requires extensive planning, coordination with multiple subcontractors, local vendors, and suppliers who operate with varying timelines and capabilities. Navigating local regulations, securing permits, and dealing
