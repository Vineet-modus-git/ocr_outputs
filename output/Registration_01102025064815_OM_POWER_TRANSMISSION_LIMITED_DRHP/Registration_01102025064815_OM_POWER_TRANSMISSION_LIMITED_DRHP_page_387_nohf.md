Trade receivables are consisting of a large number of customers. The Management has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Company's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Company's review includes market check, industry feedback, past financials and external ratings, if they are available. Sale limits are established for each customer and reviewed periodically.

The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its expected credit losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The management uses a simplified approach for the purpose of computation of expected credit loss for trade receivables. The Company's receivables can be classified into two categories, one is from the customers/ dealers in the market and second one is from the Government of India/State. As far as receivables from the Government are concerned, credit risk is Nil.

In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are reviewed according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or a legal entity, their geographic location, industry and existence of previous financial difficulties. The ageing analysis of the receivables has been considered from the date the invoice falls due.

### b. Cash and bank balances

Credit Risk on cash and cash equivalent, deposits with the banks is generally low as the said deposits have been made with the banks who have been assigned high credit rating by international and domestic rating agencies.

### c. Others

Other than trade receivables and others reported above, the Company has no other material financial assets which carries any significant credit risk.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are set led by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are fallen due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, company treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity position (comprising the undrawn borrowing facilities) and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected future cash flows. This is generally carried out in accordance with practice and limits set by the Company. These limits vary by location to take into account requirement, future cash flow and the liquidity in which the entity operates. In addition, the Company's liquidity management strategy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt financing plans.
