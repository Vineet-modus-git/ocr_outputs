Our Company in consultation with the BRLM, may decide to close the Bid/Offer Closing Period for the QIBs one Working Day prior to the Bid/ Offer Closing Date, in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations

*UPI mandate end time and date shall be at 5:00 pm on the Bid/ Offer Closing Date.

**QIBs and Non-Institutional Bidders can neither revise their Bids downwards nor cancel/withdraw their Bids.

**On the Bid/ Offer Closing Date, the Bids shall be uploaded until:**

(i) 4:00 p.m. IST for Bids by QIBs and Non-Institutional Investors; and

(ii) until 5.00 p.m. IST or such extended time as permitted by the Stock Exchanges, in case of Bids by UPI Bidders.

On the Bid/ Offer Closing Date, extension of time may be granted by the Stock Exchanges only for uploading Bids received from Retail Individual Investors after taking into account the total number of Bids received up to closure of timings for acceptance of Bid cum Application Forms as stated herein and as reported by the BRLM and as reported by the BRLM to the Stock Exchanges.

The Registrar to the Offer shall submit the details of cancelled/withdrawn/deleted applications to the SCSBs on daily basis within 60 minutes of the Bid closure time from the Bid/ Offer Opening Date till the Bid/ Offer Closing Date by obtaining the same from the Stock Exchanges. The SCSBs shall unblock such applications by the closing hours of the Working Day and submit the confirmation to the BRLM and the RTA on a daily basis, as per the format prescribed in the SEBI ICDR Master Circular.

To avoid duplication, the facility of re-initiation provided to Syndicate Members shall preferably be allowed only once per Bid/batch and as deemed fit by the Stock Exchanges, after closure of the time for uploading Bids.

**It is clarified that Bids shall be processed only after the application monies are blocked in the ASBA Account and Bids not uploaded on the electronic bidding system or in respect of which the full Bid Amount is not blocked by SCSBs or not blocked under the UPI Mechanism in the relevant ASBA Account, as the case may be, would be rejected.**

Due to limitation of time available for uploading the Bids on the Bid/ Offer Closing Date, Bidders are advised to submit their Bids one day prior to the Bid/ Offer Closing Date, and are advised to submit their Bids no later than prescribed time on the Bid/ Offer Closing Date. Any time mentioned in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus is IST. Bidders are cautioned that, in the event a large number of Bids are received on the Bid/ Offer Closing Date, some Bids may not get uploaded due to lack of sufficient time. Such Bids that cannot be uploaded will not be considered for allocation under the Offer. Bids and any revision in Bids will be accepted only during Working Days, during the Bid/ Offer Period.
