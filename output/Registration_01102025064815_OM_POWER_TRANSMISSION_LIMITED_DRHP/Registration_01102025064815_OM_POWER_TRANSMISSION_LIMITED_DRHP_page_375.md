subject to certain legal or economic limits or uncertainties is assessed individually by management based on the specific facts and circumstances.

(iv) **Accounting for defined benefit plans**

In accounting for post-retirement benefits, several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used to calculate plan expenses and liabilities. These factors include expected discount rate assumptions and rate of future compensation increases. To estimate these factors, actuarial consultants also use estimates such as withdrawal, turnover, and mortality rates which require significant judgment. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results in future periods due to changing market and economic conditions, regulatory events, judicial rulings, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter participant life spans.

(v) **Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets**

The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods.

(vi) **Impairment**

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount to determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each asset or cash generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating results. These assumptions relate to future events and circumstances. The actual results may vary and may cause significant adjustments to the Company's assets.

In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustment to market risk and the appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.

(vii) **Foreseeable losses**

In case of contracts, when it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss (foreseeable loss) is recognised. Such loss is measured based on management experience of handling similar contract in past and estimates regarding possible future incidence during the contract period. Contract where the economic benefits in the future directly or indirectly exceed the obligation under the contract, the losses are not recognized.

(viii) **Expected credit loss**

(ix) **Fair value of financial instruments**

Management uses valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of financial instruments where active market quotes are not available. In applying the valuation techniques, management makes maximum use of market inputs and uses estimates and assumptions that are, as far as possible, consistent with observable data that market participants would use in pricing the instrument. Where applicable data is not observable, management uses its best estimate about the assumptions that market participants would make. These estimates may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an arm's length transaction at the reporting date.

(x) **Provisions and contingent liabilities**

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as result of a past event and it is probable that the outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgements and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.

(xi) **Leases**

The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease required significant judgement. The Company uses judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated
