Renewables, including solar, wind, small hydro, and biomass, now form a key pillar of India's installed capacity strategy, with solar and wind showing strong year-on-year growth. Large hydroelectric projects, while technically renewable, are often tracked separately and continue to play a critical role in peak power and grid balancing. Other sources like nuclear energy provide clean baseload power, though their share remains modest due to long development timelines and regulatory complexities. Overall, India's capacity mix is shifting steadily toward cleaner sources, with a growing emphasis on grid flexibility, energy storage, and hybrid systems to support the integration of variable renewable energy.

Thermal power continues to dominate the energy landscape, accounting for 52% of the total installed capacity, or 246.93 GW. This includes coal, lignite, gas, and diesel-based generation. Despite growing environmental concerns, thermal power remains the backbone of India's electricity supply due to its ability to provide consistent base-load power and support grid stability, particularly in regions with high demand and limited renewable penetration.

Renewable Energy Sources (RES), comprising solar, wind, biomass, and small hydro, make up 36% of the installed capacity, totalling 172.36 GW. This significant share reflects India's strong commitment to clean energy, driven by ambitious government targets, favourable policy frameworks, and increased private sector participation. Solar and wind energy, in particular, have seen rapid growth due to falling technology costs and large-scale project implementation under national missions.

Hydropower contributes 10% of the capacity (47.72 GW), reinforcing its role as a flexible and dispatchable renewable source. Hydropower not only aids in peak load management but also supports grid balancing, especially with the growing share of intermittent renewables like solar and wind. Meanwhile, nuclear energy, with a capacity of 8.18 GW (or 2%), provides a stable, low-emission base-load alternative and continues to play a supporting role in India's clean energy ambitions.

This distribution of capacity in FY 2025 reflects India's multi-pronged approach to energy planning, maintaining reliable conventional generation while accelerating the shift toward greener and more sustainable energy solutions.

### Electricity generation scenario in India: current scenario & historical growth trend in generation (last 5 years)

India's electricity generation landscape is marked by a diversified energy mix and a strong emphasis on capacity expansion to meet rising demand. While, India's Generations segment has been predominant by thermal power sources, there has been significant shift towards renewable energy sources (consisting of solar, wind, biomass, and small hydro), in line with climate commitments and sustainability goals. The government has implemented numerous policy initiatives to promote clean energy, enhance grid integration, and ensure reliable supply. With a focus on self-reliance and energy security, India is also investing in nuclear power and emerging technologies like green hydrogen and battery storage. The sector is undergoing a transformation with increasing private participation, digitalization of power assets, and enhanced efficiency through modern generation techniques and environmental compliance.

India's electricity generation performance has demonstrated a steady and growth trend over recent fiscal years, reflecting an expanding capacity and increasing demand for electricity. The generation performance, measured in billion units (BU), shows a clear upward trajectory from FY 2019 to FY 2025, with an overall Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.8%. In FY 2019, the total electricity generation was 1,376 BU. This figure experienced a modest increase to 1,389 BU in FY 2020 and then slightly rose to 1,382 BU in FY 2021. A more significant rise was observed in FY 2022, where generation reached 1,492 BU. The growth continued into FY 2023, with generation reaching 1,624 BU, and the latest data for FY 2025 shows a further increase to 1,824 BU.
