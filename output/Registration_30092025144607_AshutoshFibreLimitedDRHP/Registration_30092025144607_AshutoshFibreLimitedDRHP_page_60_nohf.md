India has historically experienced episodes of terrorism, military conflict and geopolitical tensions, particularly with neighboring countries. Most recently, on April 22, 2025, a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir resulted in the death of 26 civilians. In response, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, 2025, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan, including the neutralization of drones across Gujarat and Rajasthan.

India's geopolitical environment remains sensitive. Tensions with Pakistan, particularly regarding border security and terrorism, continue to pose risks. For example, in February 2019, hostilities escalated following the Pulwama terrorist attack and subsequent military retaliation, including air strikes and the downing of fighter aircraft. Any similar future escalations—especially in regions linked to agricultural production or export logistics—could disrupt trade, destabilize currency, impair investor sentiment and adversely affect economic activity.

Additionally, past incidents such as the coordinated terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008 and various instances of civil unrest have demonstrated the potential for significant economic and social disruption. Events of this nature may affect communication networks, restrict movement of goods and personnel, interrupt our supply chains and negatively impact business operations and confidence in Indian markets.

While we maintain risk mitigation and continuity measures, we cannot assure that such incidents will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.

**80. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in global economic and geo political conditions.**

As substantially all of our operations are dependent on our customers who have their head offices or parent companies situated outside India, our financial performance and growth are necessarily dependent on economic conditions prevalent globally. The global economy may be materially and adversely affected by political instability or regional conflicts; a general rise in interest rates; inflation; exchange rate fluctuations; changes in tax, trade and monetary policies; occurrence of natural or man-made disasters; downgrade in debt rating; and adverse economic conditions occurring elsewhere in the world, such as a slowdown in economic growth in China, the repercussions of the United Kingdom exit from the European Union and other matters. While the Indian economy has grown significantly in recent years, it has experienced economic slowdowns in the past due to global economic and geopolitical conditions. The Indian economy in particular could be adversely impacted by inflationary pressures, currency depreciation, the poor performance of its large agricultural and manufacturing sectors, trade deficits, recent initiatives by the Indian government and other factors. Unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could result in a corresponding decline in our business

**81. Investors may be adversely affected due to retrospective tax law changes made by the GoI affecting us.**

Certain recent changes to the Income Tax Act provide that income arising directly or indirectly through the sale of a capital asset of an offshore company, including shares, will be subject to tax in India, if such shares derive indirectly or directly their value substantially from assets located in India. The term “substantially” has not been defined under the Income Tax Act and therefore, the applicability and implications of these changes are largely unclear. Due to these recent changes, investors may be subject to Indian income taxes on the income arising directly or indirectly through the sale of the Equity Shares. In the past, there have been instances where changes in the Income Tax Act have been made retrospectively and to that extent, there cannot be an assurance that such retrospective changes will not happen again.

**82. If certain labour laws become applicable to us, our profitability may be adversely affected.**

India has stringent labour legislations that protect the interests of workers, including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes certain financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment. Any change or modification in the existing labour laws may affect our flexibility in formulating labour related policies.
