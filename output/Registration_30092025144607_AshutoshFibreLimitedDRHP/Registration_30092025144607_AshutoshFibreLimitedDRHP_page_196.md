The BIS Act provides for the establishment of the Bureau of Indian Standards ("BIS") for the harmonious development of the activities of standardisation, conformity assessment and quality assurance of goods, articles, processes, systems and services. The BIS Act for the functions of the BIS includes, among others, (a) recognizing as an Indian standard, any standard established for any article or process by any other institution in India or elsewhere; (b) specifying a standard mark which shall be of such design and contain such particulars as may be prescribed to represent a particular Indian standard; and (c) undertake testing of samples for purposes other than for conformity assessment and (d) undertake activities related to legal metrology. The BIS Act empowers the Central Government in consultation with the BIS to order compulsory use of standard marks for any goods or process if it finds it expedient to do so in the public interest. The BIS Act also provides penalties in case there is a contravention of the provisions of the BIS Act.

## BUREAU OF INDIAN STANDARDS RULES, 2018 (THE "BUREAU OF INDIAN STANDARDS RULES")

Under the Bureau of Indian Standards Rules, the bureau is required to establish Indian standards in relation to any goods, article, process, system or service and shall reaffirm, amend, revise or withdraw Indian standards so established as may be necessary.

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED LEGISLATIONS

In general, the Intellectual Property Rights include but are not limited to the following enactments:

1. Trademarks Act, 1999

2. Indian Copyright Act, 1957

3. The Patents Act, 1970

4. Design Act, 2000

## TRADE MARKS ACT, 1999 ("TRADE MARKS ACT")

The Trade Marks Act governs the statutory protection of trademarks and prevention of the use of fraudulent marks in India. It provides for the application and registration of trademarks in India. It also provides for exclusive rights to marks such as brand, label and heading and to obtain relief in case of infringement for commercial purposes as a trade description. Under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, an application for trade mark registration may be made with the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks by any person or persons claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark, whether individually or as joint applicants and can be made on the basis of either actual use or intention to use a trade mark in the future. Once granted, a trademark registration is valid for 10 years unless cancelled, subsequent to which, it can be renewed. If not renewed, the mark lapses and the registration is required to be restored to gain protection under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act.

The Trade Marks Act prohibits registration of deceptively similar trademarks and provides penalties for infringement, falsifying or falsely applying for trademarks. Further, pursuant to the notification of the Trade Marks (Amendment) Act, 2010, simultaneous protection of trademark in India and other countries has been made available to owners of Indian and foreign trade marks. It also seeks to simplify the law relating to the transfer of ownership of trademarks by assignment or transmission and to bring the law in line with international practices.

## COPYRIGHT ACT, 1957

Copyright protection in India is governed by the Copyright Act and the Rules made thereunder. Although obtaining or enforcing a copyright in an otherwise protectable work does not require copyright registration, registration under the copyright laws serves as prima facie evidence of the information entered therein and speeds up infringement proceedings by minimizing delays brought on by evidentiary considerations. According to the Copyright Act, infractions are punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, with the severity of the penalty increasing for repeat offenders.

## THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 ("PATENTS ACT")

The Patents Act governs the patent regime in India. India is a signatory to the Trade Related Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights and recognizes both product as well as process patents. The Patents Act provides for, inter alia, the following:

* Patent protection period of 20 years from the date of filing the patent application;

* Recognition of product patents in respect of food, medicine and drugs;

* Import of patented products will not be considered as an infringement; and

* Under certain circumstances, the burden of proof in case of infringement of process patents may be transferred to the alleged infringer.
