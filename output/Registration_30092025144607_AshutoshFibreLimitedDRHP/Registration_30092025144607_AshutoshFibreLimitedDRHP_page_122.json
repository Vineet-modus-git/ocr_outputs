Inflation is projected to converge back to the target earlier in advanced economies, reaching 2.2% in 2026, whereas in emerging market and developing economies, it is anticipated to decrease to 4.6% during the same period. Trade tariffs function as a supply shock for the countries imposing them, leading to a decrease in productivity and an increase in unit costs. Countries subject to tariffs experience a negative demand shock as export demand declines, placing downward pressure on prices. In each scenario, trade uncertainty introduces an additional layer of demand shock since businesses and households react by delaying investment and spending and this impact could be intensified by stricter financial conditions and heightened exchange rate volatility. Moreover, Global trade growth is expected to slow down in 2025 to 1.7%. This forecast reflects increased tariff restrictions affecting trade flows and, to a lesser extent, the waning effects of cyclical factors that have underpinned the recent rise in goods trade. Geopolitical tensions as seen in the past such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could exacerbate inflation volatility, particularly in energy and agricultural commodities."}, {"bbox": [111, 517, 620, 549], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## INDIA MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS"}, {"bbox": [111, 580, 1541, 680], "category": "Text", "text": "India emerged as one of the fastest growth economies amongst the leading advanced economies and emerging economies.
