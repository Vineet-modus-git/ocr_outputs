on price and flexibility. Our Company competes with other manufacturers of technical and synthetic yarns in domestic markets. The industry is also exposed to competition from substitute materials and evolving manufacturing processes that may affect demand for existing products. In this environment, our focus remains on maintaining product quality, ensuring timely delivery, expanding our product portfolio and leveraging our operational efficiency to retain and grow our customer base. We face competition from listed peers like RSWM Limited, Reliance Chemotex, Garware Technical Fibres Limited, Cedaar Textile Limited. (Source: D&B Report)

## RAW MATERIAL

The primary raw materials required for our products include Polypropylene Fibre, Modacrylic Fibre, Para-Aramid Fibre and Flame Retardant (FR) Viscose Fibre, which are sourced from diversified suppliers. The company's raw material procurement process is a critical function managed by the Purchase and Supply Chain Department. The process involves a structured approach from sample acquisition to final quality confirmation, ensuring all materials meet the technical specifications required for manufacturing.

Our sourcing network comprises both domestic and international suppliers. By maintaining a vendor base across geographies, the Company is able to ensure a stable and reliable supply chain while reducing dependency on any single source. This balanced approach allows us to mitigate risks relating to availability, quality and pricing and ensures continuity in production to meet customer requirements.

The company holds an Advance License issued by the Joint Director General of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India, authorizing the import of various raw materials, including fibres and chemicals, for the manufacture of technical textiles for export purposes. This license ensures the company can procure high-quality raw materials globally while maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements. For further information on regulatory requirements, please refer to chapter "Government and Other Statutory Approvals" at page 253 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus

## TECHNOLOGY

Our Company employs a range of technologies across its operations to support manufacturing efficiency, product quality and sustainability.

a. **Compact Spinning Systems:** These systems compact the fibre strand prior to twisting, which helps reduce hairiness, improve yarn strength and enhance finish quality, making the yarn suitable for various applications.

b. **Core Yarn Spinning Attachments:** The Company has incorporated systems that enable the production of core yarns by binding different fibre types around a central filament. This facilitates the manufacture of yarns with improved elasticity, durability and strength.

c. **Automatic Winding Technology:** Advanced winding systems are used to support defect-free winding with reduced human intervention. These systems contribute to consistent yarn package quality, support high-speed production and improve efficiency in the production line.

d. **Fabric-to-Fibre Recycling Technology:** The Company has adopted recycling processes that allow the recovery of high-tenacity fibres, including para-aramid, from end-of-life fabrics. This supports circularity in operations, reduces dependence on virgin raw material and contributes to sustainability initiatives.

e. **Quality Control Equipment:** Instruments such as yarn evenness testers are used to evaluate the uniformity and consistency of yarn, helping maintain quality standards and identify potential defects.

f. **Spinning and Doubling Systems:** The Company utilises ring frame technology and two-for-one doubling with electronic draft systems to support precise yarn formation, reduce yarn faults and enable high-speed production.

g. **Enterprise Management Tools:** For financial and operational management, the Company uses integrated accounting and resource tracking software that supports inventory management, billing, compliance and related functions.

## HEALTH AND SAFETY

Our Company places strong emphasis on the health and safety of its employees and has implemented policies and procedures to minimize occupational hazards. We provide a safe working environment through installation of fire protection systems such as hydrants, extinguishers, emergency lighting and exit signage, as well as regular training of workers in handling fire and emergency situations. Employees are provided with personal protective equipment, including masks in high-risk areas such as the blow room, to reduce exposure to fibre particles. We also undertake periodic health and safety training, user friendly assessments and emergency preparedness drills to ensure compliance with applicable workplace safety standards and to safeguard the well-being
