Pursuant to a resolution passed during the year, the Company sub-divided each equity share of ₹1,000 into 100 equity shares of ₹10 each. Post share split, the equity shares have a par value of ₹10 each. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote per share held. The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to the approval of the shareholders in the ensuing Annual General Meeting, except in the case of interim dividends, which may be declared by the Board at its discretion. In the event of liquidation, the equity shareholders are entitled to receive the remaining assets of the Company, after distribution of all preferential amounts, in proportion to their shareholding.

The Board and shareholder at its Extra ordinary general meeting held on 14-06-2024 approved sub-division of equity shares of the Company with existing face value of ₹ 1,000/- per share each fully paid up into 100 each fully paid up shares of face value of ₹ 10/- per share.
