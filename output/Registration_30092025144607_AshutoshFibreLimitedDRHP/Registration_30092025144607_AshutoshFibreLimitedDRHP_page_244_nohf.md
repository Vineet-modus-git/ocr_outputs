ACCOUNTING POLICIES

10 Accounting for Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:

Provisions are recognized in terms of Accounting Standard 29- 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets' (AS 29), when there is present legal or statutory obligation as a result of past events, where it is probable that there will be outflow of resources to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Contingent liabilities are recognized only when there is a possible obligation arising from past events due to occurrence or non occurrence of one or more uncertain events, not wholly within the control of the company, or where any present obligation cannot be measured in terms of future outflow of resources or where a reliable estimate of the obligation cannot be made. Obligations are assessed on an ongoing basis and only those having a largely probable outflow of resources are provided for. Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements.

11 Employee Benefits:

(a) Defined Contribution Plan:

As regards to provident fund benefits, the company makes the stipulated contribution in respect of employees covered by the provident funds act to provident fund authority under which company's liability is limited to the extent to contribution. The company's contribution to the recognized provident fund, paid/payable during the year, is charged to the profit and loss account.

(b) Defined Benefits Plan:

The liability for the defined benefit plan of gratuity is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation done by an independent actuary at the year end, which is calculated using projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses which comprise experience adjustment and the effect of change in actuarial assumptions are recognized in profit and loss account

(c) Other retirement benefits in the form of Leave Encashment are accounted on cash basis.

12 Impairment of Assets:

(a) The carrying amount of assets other than inventories is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.

(b) The impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generation unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the assets net selling price and value in the uses which is determined based on the estimated future cash flow discounted to their present values. All impairment losses are recognized in the profit and loss account.

(c) An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and is recognized in the profit and loss account.

13 Cash and cash equivalents :

The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into known amount of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.

14 Events occuring after reporting period :

Where events occurring after the BalanceSheet date provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, the impact of such events is adjusted within the financial statements. Otherwise, nature and consequent impact of the events of material size, occurring after the Balance Sheet date,are only disclosed.
