## Expand Global Market Reach

Our Company has established a diversified manufacturing base that includes five processing lines and three distinct yarn production technologies, namely Ring Spun, DREF (Friction Spun) and Open-End. This mix of capabilities provides the flexibility to cater to a wide range of customer requirements in both domestic and international markets.

As part of our business strategy, we propose to invest in capital expenditure that will increase our installed capacity. The objective of this expansion is to scale production volumes in order to address growing customer demand, improve efficiency and enhance our ability to service international markets. The additional capacity is also expected to support product diversification and strengthen our competitive positioning in the technical yarn industry.

Our efforts to increase manufacturing capabilities are aligned with a broader goal of improving export potential. By leveraging existing operational strengths and expanding production infrastructure, we seek to increase our presence in global markets and gradually grow the proportion of revenue generated from exports. This approach is designed to support long-term, export-led growth while maintaining a balance between domestic and international sales.

For the periods under review, exports contributed ₹ 4,339.15 Lakhs, ₹ 4,789.49 Lakhs and ₹ 3,539.55 Lakhs to our revenue from operations, representing 38.05%, 43.59% and 36.15% during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively.

In parallel, we plan to diversify our revenue base by targeting additional export markets, particularly those with demand for specialised technical yarns. This approach will reduce dependence on domestic cycles and position us as a reliable and innovation-driven supplier in the global technical textile industry.

## Expansion into Technical Textile Markets

We plan to diversify our product portfolio by entering high-value technical yarn markets such as milled acrylic and milled carbon yarns, which have specialized applications in sectors including fire-resistant fabrics, composite reinforcement and advanced industrial textiles. These markets are witnessing increased global demand due to stricter safety, performance and sustainability requirements.

## Automation, Digitization and Export-Led Growth

To further improve efficiency and competitiveness, our Company intends to expand the adoption of automation and digital tools across manufacturing and administrative processes. We aim to incorporate solutions such as integrated planning systems, automated inventory management and data-driven monitoring and analytics to optimise production visibility and operational control.
