This initiative by Government of India was planned to span between FY 2020-21 to 2025-26 aimed at providing financial assistance worth ₹1,48,000 lakhs. NTTM comprises four key components Research & Innovation, Promotion & Market Development, Export Promotion and Education & Skill Development designed to foster advancements in fibres and yarns for applications across agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, defence and more. As of March 2025, 168 research projects valued at ₹50,900 lakhs have been sanctioned and nearly 50,000 individuals are being trained under its aegis. Through grants such as GIST 2.0 and the GREAT Scheme, along with efforts to standardise and enhance market outreach, NTTM is accelerating prototype development, industry-academy collaboration and export readiness driving India's ambition to lead the USD 10 billion global technical textiles market.\n* **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Textiles:** The Government of India, through a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Textiles, approved in September 2021 with an outlay of ₹10,683 Crore, aims to bolster domestic manufacturing in Man-Made Fibre (MMF) fabrics, MMF apparel and technical textile segments, including value-added yarns. The scheme incentivizes eligible manufacturers with cash payouts of 4-11% (depending on the product category) on incremental annual turnover over a five-year period, covering fiscal years 2024-25 to 2028-29 subject to investment and performance thresholds. As confirmed by an official Press Information Bureau release, 64 of 67 applications have been selected so far, representing ₹19,798 Crore in proposed investments, a projected turnover of ₹1,93,926.00 crore and forecasted employment for over 2.45 lakh individuals. By promoting large-scale capital infusion and scaling up production capacity, the PLI scheme is reinforcing India's competitiveness in the global technical textile market.\n* **Mandatory Use of Technical Textiles in Government Projects:** The Ministry of Textiles, under a Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order dated October 23, 2019, has mandated the use of technical textiles across 92 application areas in government-funded infrastructure projects managed by 10 central ministries including agriculture, horticulture, highways, railways, water resources and healthcare. As of the latest update, notifications for 68 specific applications have been issued, ensuring that geotextiles, agro-textiles and other high-performance textile products are systematically integrated into official schemes. This policy guarantees steady demand for specialized yarns, supporting domestic manufacturers and advancing the government's goals of sustainable infrastructure development and self-reliance.\n* **Support from Textile Research Associations (TRAs):** Under the aegis of the Ministry of Textiles, leading Textile Research Associations including SASMIRA (Synthetic & Art Silk Mills' Research Association, Mumbai), NITRA (Northern India Textile Research Association, Ghaziabad), ATIRA (Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association) and BTRA (Bombay Textile Research Association, Mumbai) serve as key pillars of India's technical textiles ecosystem. Recognized on the ministry's official portal, these autonomous institutes are empaneled under the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) to provide vital services like testing, certification, R&D, prototype development, technical consultancy and skill training for yarns and fibres. For instance, NITRA has been designated a Centre of Excellence for protective and automotive textiles, while SASMIRA acts as a nodal centre for geotextiles, agro-textiles and medical textiles. These TRAs foster industry-academia linkages and capacity-building initiatives, accelerating innovations in high-performance yarns and enabling domestic manufacturers to meet evolving technical standards.\n* **Skill Development and Training:** The Ministry of Textiles, through its flagship Samarth – Scheme for Capacity Building in the Textile Sector, is actively training manpower to meet the growing demands of the technical textiles industry,"}]
