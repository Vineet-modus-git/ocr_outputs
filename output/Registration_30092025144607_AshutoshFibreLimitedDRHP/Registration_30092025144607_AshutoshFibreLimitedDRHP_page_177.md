Our Company has obtained various insurance policies to safeguard its assets, stock, vehicles and business operations. These include Burglary Insurance, Standard Fire & Special Perils Insurance, Marine Export Import Insurance (Open Policy), Marine Inland Declaration Policy, Industry Protector Insurance and Saral Bharat Sookshma Udyam Suraksha Policy, covering risks such as fire, burglary, allied perils, machinery and stock at third-party job-work locations.

The Company also maintains marine insurance for exports, imports, indigenous sales and purchases and transit of goods. These policies provide coverage against a wide range of risks including fire, burglary, marine transit losses, electronic equipment breakdown and damage to vehicles.

Our insurance portfolio is reviewed periodically to ensure adequacy of coverage and alignment with industry practices.
