FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Draft Red Herring Prospectus contains certain "forward-looking statements". These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words or phrases such as "will", "aim", "is likely to result", "believe", "expect", "will continue", "anticipate", "estimate", "intend", "plan", "contemplate", "seek to", "future", "objective", "goal", "project", "should", "will pursue" and similar expressions or variations of such expressions. Similarly, statements that describe business strategy, objective, plans or goals, revenue and profitability, projects are also forward-looking statements.

All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties associated with expectations relating to, inter alia, regulatory changes pertaining to the industries in India in which we operate and our ability to respond to them, our ability to successfully implement our strategy, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general economic and political conditions in India which have an impact on its business activities or investments, the monetary and fiscal policies of India, inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices or other rates or prices, the performance of the financial markets in India and globally, changes in domestic laws, incidence of any natural calamities and/or violence, regulations and taxes and changes in competition in the industries in which we operate. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect. Certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:

* General economic and business conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the local, regional, national and international economies;

* Inability to promptly identify and respond to changing technologies;

* We may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates and our historical performance may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results;

* Failure to successfully upgrade our fleet of equipment, from time to time;

* Any change in government policies resulting in increases in taxes payable by us;

* Our ability to retain our management's personnel and other employees;

* We are dependent on certain customers for a portion of our revenues. Loss of relationship with any of these customers or a reduction in their demand for our services may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations;

* Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect our earnings and profitability;

* Delay in expansion into new territories;

* Changes in laws and regulations that apply to the industries in which we operate;

* Our ability to grow our business;

* The occurrence of natural disasters or calamities;

* General economic, political and other risks that are out of our control;

* Inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, equity prices or other rates or prices;

* Company's inability to successfully implement its growth strategy and expansion plans;

* Failure to comply with regulations prescribed by authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate;

* Occurrence of Environmental Problems & Uninsured Losses;

* Conflicts of interest with affiliated companies, the promoter group and other related parties;

* Any adverse outcome in the legal proceedings in which we are involved;

* Concentration of ownership among our Promoter;

* Our ability to retain Key Customers impacting our major business and performances;

* The COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or widespread public health emergency could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows; and

* any adverse outcome in the legal proceedings in which we and our promoters are involved.

For further discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ, see the Section titled "Risk Factors", "Our Business" and "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations" beginning on pages 27, 145 and 235 respectively. By their nature, certain market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. As a result, actual future gains or losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated. There can be no assurance to investors that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Given these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements and not to regard such statements as a guarantee of our future performance.

Neither our Company or our Directors or our Officers or Book Running Lead Manager or Underwriter nor any of their respective affiliates have any obligation to update or revise any statements reflecting circumstances arising after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of underlying events, even if the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition. In accordance with SEBI requirements, our Company and the BRLM will ensure that investors in India are informed of material developments until such time as the grant of listing and trading permission by the Stock Exchange for the Equity Shares allotted pursuant to this Issue.
