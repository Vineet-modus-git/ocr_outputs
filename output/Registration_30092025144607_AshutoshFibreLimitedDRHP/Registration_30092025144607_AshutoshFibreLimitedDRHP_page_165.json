HT polyester yarns exhibit low shrinkage and resistance to abrasion, making them suitable for applications where consistent performance under stress is required.<br>We manufacture and sell HT Polyester Yarn, using specialised spinning and processing machinery installed at our manufacturing facility.<br>The primary end-use application of our HT Polyester Yarn is in the production of sewing threads, which are widely utilised across the apparel, upholstery and industrial stitching industries.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Meta Aramid and FR Viscose Yarn</td><td>Our Company manufactures blended yarns using meta-aramid and flame-retardant (FR) viscose fibres. Meta-aramid fibres provide resistance to heat and flame, while FR viscose fibres contribute moisture absorbency and comfort, making the blend suitable for protective and industrial textile applications.<br>The principal end-use applications of our Meta Aramid and FR Viscose Yarn include:<ul><li><strong>Protective clothing</strong>: gloves, sleeves and garments designed for industrial workers.</li><li><strong>Specialised uniforms</strong>: firefighter uniforms and defence uniforms.</li><li><strong>Industry-specific apparel</strong>: garments used in the oil and gas industry, where flame resistance is a critical requirement.</li><li><strong>Export markets</strong>: our yarns are also supplied for use in the manufacture of garments for the armies of certain foreign countries having strategic relationships with India.</li></ul></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>100% Polypropylene Yarn</td><td>Our Company manufactures yarn made entirely from polypropylene fibres. Polypropylene is a synthetic polymer characterised by low density, low moisture absorption and resistance to a wide range of chemicals. These inherent properties make it suitable for functional as well as technical textile applications.<br>The primary end-use applications of our polypropylene yarn include:<ul><li><strong>Filtration industry</strong>: used in filter fabrics and cartridges for water treatment, chemical processing and air purification systems.</li><li><strong>Automotive sector</strong>: applied in the manufacture of air and fuel filters.</li></ul></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [996, 145, 1484, 775], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1082, 786, 1394, 1165], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1082, 1193, 1394, 1554], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1096, 1554, 1381, 1933], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [803, 2176, 848, 2206], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "161"}]
