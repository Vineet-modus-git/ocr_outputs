iii. The commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in the one way and partly in the other.

6.

i. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, subject to the provisions of section 48 and whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.

ii. To every such separate meeting, the provisions of these regulations relating general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be at least two persons holding at least one-third of the issued shares of the class in question.

7. The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further share ranking pari passu therewith.

8. Subject to the provisions of section 55, any preference shares may, with the sanction of an ordinary resolution, be issued on the terms that they are to be redeemed on such terms and in such manner as the company before the issue of the shares may, by special resolution, determine.

NEW CAPITAL SAME AS ORIGINAL CAPITAL

9. Except so far as otherwise provided by the conditions of issue or by these Articles any capital raised by the creation of new shares shall be considered part of the initial capital and shall be subject to the provisions herein contained with reference to the payment of calls and installments; transfer and transmission, forfeiture, lien, surrender, voting and otherwise.

FURTHER ISSUE OF SHARES

10.
(1) Where at any time the company proposes to increase its subscribed capital by the issue of further shares, such shares shall be offered -

(a) to persons who at the date of the offer are holders of equity shares of the company in proportion, as nearly as circumstances admit to the paid-up share capital on those shares by sending a letter of offer subject to the following conditions, namely:

(i) the offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered and limiting a time not being less than fifteen days and not exceeding thirty days from the date of the offer within which the offer, if not accepted, shall be deemed to have been declined;

(ii) unless the articles of the company otherwise provide, the offer aforesaid shall be deemed to include a right exercisable by the person concerned to renounce the shares offered to him or any of them in favour of any other person; and the notice referred to in clause (i) shall contain a statement of this right;

(iii) after the expiry of the time specified in the notice aforesaid, or on receipt of earlier intimation from the person to whom such notice is given that he declines to accept the shares offered, the Board of Directors may dispose of them in such manner which is not disadvantageous to the shareholders and the company;

(b) to employees under a scheme of employees' stock option, subject to special resolution passed by company and subject to such conditions as may be determined by central government; or

(c) to any persons, if it is authorized by a special resolution, whether or not those persons include the persons referred to in clause (a) or clause (b), either for cash or for a consideration other than cash, if the price of such shares is determined by the valuation report of a registered valuer subject to such conditions as may be determined by central government.

(2) The notice referred to in sub-clause (i) of clause (1) (a) shall be dispatched through registered post or speed post or through electronic mode to all the existing shareholders at least three days before the opening of the issue.

(3) Nothing in this section shall apply to the increase of the subscribed capital of a company caused by the exercise of an option as a term attached to the debentures issued or loan raised by the company to convert such debentures or loans into shares in the company.

The terms of issue of such debentures or loan containing such an option have been approved before the issue of such debentures or the raising of loan by a special resolution passed by the company in general meeting.

(4) The rights conferred upon the holders of shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights, not unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of the issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.
