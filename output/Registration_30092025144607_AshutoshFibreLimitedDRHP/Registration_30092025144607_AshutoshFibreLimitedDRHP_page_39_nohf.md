14. **Our business operations, expansion plans and renewable energy projects are dependent on leased premises and any adverse development relating to such lease arrangements may affect our operations.**

Our Company conducts its administrative operations from its registered office located at 111, New Cloth Market, Raipur, Ahmedabad – 380002, Gujarat, India, which is held on lease for a period of 5 years commencing in 2022. Since this property is not owned, we are dependent on the lease agreement for our continued use of the premises. Any early termination, refusal of renewal, or modification of terms on renewal could require us to vacate or relocate, leading to disruption of administrative activities, additional expenditure for alternative premises and time required for shifting operations.

Our manufacturing activities are carried out at Building Nos. 27, 28 and 29, City Survey No. 156, Station Road, Village Petlad, Ahmedabad – 388450, Gujarat, India, which is held on lease for a period of 10 years commencing in 2023. As this manufacturing facility is critical for our production activities, any interruption to our leasehold rights may affect continuity of operations. Relocation of manufacturing operations would involve time, cost and administrative effort and there can be no assurance that suitable alternative premises would be available in a timely manner or at acceptable commercial terms.

One of the Objects of the Issue is to fund the installation of equipment and machinery at this leased manufacturing facility. The Company has incurred costs for setting up and upgrading this facility, including installation of equipment and related infrastructure. Since these investments are made on leased premises, continuity of benefits from such investments is dependent on our ability to continue occupying the premises under the lease terms. Any inability to continue operations at this facility may limit the benefits intended from the new equipment and machinery.

In addition to the above, the Company has invested in renewable energy projects for captive consumption. A 380 KW rooftop solar power system has been installed on the Petlad manufacturing facility, which became operational on January 19, 2022, under an agreement dated January 3, 2022. Further, the Company has commissioned a 4 MW solar power plant for captive consumption on leased land located at Survey Nos. 843/72/01, 843/73/01 and 843/74/01, Village Kankanpur, Taluka Godhra, District Panchmahal, Gujarat. Expenditure has been incurred for installation and commissioning of these solar projects on leasehold properties. Any termination or non-renewal of lease, or any adverse development relating to ownership or usage rights of such land, may affect the continuity of these projects and the cost benefits expected from them.

Accordingly, our registered office, manufacturing unit, installation of equipment and machinery, rooftop solar facility and ground-mounted solar power project are all located on leased premises. Our ability to continue operations, implement expansion plans and derive expected benefits from our investments is dependent on uninterrupted access to these leased properties. Any adverse development affecting leasehold rights, renewal terms, or usage rights in respect of these premises may have an effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. For further details of our properties, please refer to the chapter titled "Our Business – Immovable Property" on page 171.

15. **Our business is dependent on our registered office and manufacturing unit, which are both operated on leased premises and we are subject to risks relating to lease arrangements, operational disruptions, capacity utilization and concentration of operations in a single geography.**

Our Company conducts its administrative operations from its registered office held on lease for 5 years starting in 2022, which is situated at 111, New Cloth Market, Raipur Ahmedabad – 380002, Gujarat, India and our manufacturing operations are carried out at Building Nos. 27, 28 and 29, City Survey No. 156, Station Road, Village Petlad, Ahmedabad – 388450, Gujarat, India which is held on lease for a period of 10 years commencing in 2023. As we do not own these premises, we are exposed to the inherent risks of leased properties, including early termination, non-renewal on expiry, or the possibility of continued occupation only on terms less favourable than our current arrangement. Any requirement to vacate or relocate our registered office may result in disruption of our administrative and support functions, additional capital expenditure, logistical challenges and potential downtime. Further, there is no assurance that suitable alternative premises would be available to us in a timely manner or at commercially acceptable terms.

In addition, any adverse developments relating to the ownership, title, or usage rights of the lessor of these properties may impact our continued access to the premises. Since these premises are critical to our day-to-day operations, any disruption may adversely affect our business continuity, financial condition and results of operations. For further details of our registered office, please refer to the chapter titled "Our Business" starting on page 145.

16. **Any under-utilization of capacity of our manufacturing facilities, delays in commissioning of proposed equipment and machinery, or concentration of operations at a single location may affect our business, revenues and financial performance.**

Our Company operates its manufacturing activities from a single facility located at Petlad, Gujarat, which is held on lease. As disclosed in the chapter titled "Our Business – Immovable Property" on page 171, this facility forms the backbone of our manufacturing operations. Our dependence on a single manufacturing facility exposes us to risks associated with unplanned
