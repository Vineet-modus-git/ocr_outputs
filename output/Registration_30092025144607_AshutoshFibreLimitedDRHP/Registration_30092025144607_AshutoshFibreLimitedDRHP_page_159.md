<table><thead><tr><th>PROCESS</th><th>MACHINES USED</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Carding:</strong><br>After the blowroom stage, fibres still contain clumps and locks that must be opened for further processing. Carding is a critical step in yarn manufacturing, as it transforms the mass of fibre tufts into a more uniform strand by disentangling, cleaning and aligning the fibres.<br><br>The purpose of carding is twofold:<ul><li>To individualise the fibres by separating them from clumps and impurities.</li><li>To consolidate the fibres into a continuous web, which is then condensed into a sliver of the required count.</li></ul><br>In practice, the carding stage in mills involves the following key operations:<ul><li><em>Lapping</em>: Removal of fine dust, neps and impurities to improve cleanliness and fibre integrity.</li><li><em>Willowing</em>: Loosening of fibres into an open state, ensuring easier handling and minimising stress on the fibres in subsequent processes.</li><li><em>Carding Proper</em>: Mechanical combing action that individualises the strands, eliminates neps and improves fibre alignment.</li><li><em>Drawing</em>: Consolidation of the carded web into a sliver, enabling uniform density and consistent feed for the next stage of spinning.</li></ul><strong>Quality:</strong> After the carding process, fibers are converted from entangled tufts into uniform, parallel and clean bulk form called a Sliver, which is suitable for spinning in subsequent stages. The Card Sliver is tested for Evenness U%, CV% and Hank (Count).</td><td><img src="" alt="Carding Machine Image"><br>Carding Machine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Drawing:</strong><br>At the drawing stage the manufacturing process, significantly enhances the uniformity and quality of the sliver prepared during carding. It serves as the foundation for achieving consistency and strength in the yarn that follows. The key objectives of the drawing process are as follows:<ol><li><strong>Drafting</strong>: It reduces the weight per yard of the sliver while proportionally increasing its length, ensuring finer and more workable fibre strands.</li><li><strong>Equalization</strong>: Minimises irregularities present in the carded sliver by doubling and overlapping multiple slivers, thereby achieving greater uniformity.</li><li><strong>Parallelization</strong>: Aligning and straightening fibres within a sliver, improving strength and cohesion.</li><li><strong>Blending</strong>: Combines fibres from different sources or batches to create a homogeneous mix and maintain product consistency.</li><li><strong>Dust Removal</strong>: Extracts any residual fine dust or impurities that may remain after carding.</li></ol>This stage is generally repeated <em>two to three times</em>, with each passage progressively reducing variability and ensuring that the sliver is well-blended and consistent, thereby preparing it for further processing.<br><br><strong>Quality Testing:</strong> Upon the completion of the drawing process, quality parameters are carefully monitored using the Mesdan Evenness Tester, a globally recognised standard in yarn testing.<ul><li><strong>Unevenness (U%)</strong> - mass variation across the sliver length.</li><li><strong>Coefficient of Variation of Mass (CVm%)</strong> - precision of weight consistency.</li></ul></td><td><img src="" alt="Draw Frame Image"><br>Draw Frame</td></tr></tbody></table>
