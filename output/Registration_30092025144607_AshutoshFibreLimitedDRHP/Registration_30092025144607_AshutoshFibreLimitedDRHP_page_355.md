* The allocable shares for each category will be mentioned in the RHP in the proportion of subscription amongst each category,

* Within each basis of allotment, the number of applications are pooled based on lot category and proportionate eligibility of allotment of shares for each category is calculated as per illustration of HNI basis as shown below:

## Allotment Process:

The entire Basis of allotment is based on Reverse Application number so that the lottery system allotment is truly random and there is absolutely no scope of discretion. The basis will be submitted to stock exchange for their approval and draw of lucky numbers for the ratio. The lucky no's are shared by the Exchange as per the ratio arrived for each category. Once the lucky numbers are assigned, the applications forming part of that category will be taken separately and their application numbers will be reversed. For example, if the application no. is 12345678, after reversal it will become 87654321. After reversing the application numbers, they will be arranged in ascending order and will be assigned with numbers starting from 1 according to the ratio. For example, in the first category of 1000 lot, the 30 application numbers will be reversed and arranged in ascending order. They will be assigned numbers from 1 to 3 repeatedly in loop. If the lucky numbers chosen by stock exchange is 1 & 3 for this category, then those applications which were assigned with numbers 1 & 3 will be allottee applications and the applications assigned with number 2 will be non-allottee application. This Process gets repeated for all the categories where allotment needs to be done on lottery basis.
