Accordingly, any inability on our part to comply with export obligations, or any adverse developments in foreign trade policy or international market conditions, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

4. If the technical textile yarn industry faces slowdown in growth, supply disruptions, regulatory changes, decline in demand, Commodity Price Volatility and Impact on Cost Structure, our production costs, operating margin and overall financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

Our business is closely tied to the performance of the technical textile yarn industry, which is exposed to a range of risks and uncertainties. We operate across the Indutech, Protech, Mobiltech and Hometech products, deriving significant revenues from the manufacture of polypropylene spun yarn, aramid-based yarns, modacrylic blends and flame-retardant viscose-based yarns. A slowdown in demand from end-use industries such as industrial filtration, protective clothing, or home textiles could materially and adversely impact our operations.

A large portion of our raw materials, particularly para-aramid, meta-aramid, modacrylic and FR viscose fibres, are imported. This reliance exposes us to foreign exchange volatility, global supply chain disruptions and import duties. Any delays in procurement or supply chain disruption may affect our ability to meet customer demand on time. The proportion of imported raw materials in our total purchases has remained high over the last three financial years, as shown below:

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="3">For the Financial Year ended on</th></tr><tr><th>March 31, 2025</th><th>March 31, 2024</th><th>March 31, 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Raw Materials Consumed (₹ in lakhs)</td><td>6,973.59</td><td>6,799.63</td><td>5,871.82</td></tr><tr><td>% of Revenue from Operations</td><td>61.15%</td><td>61.89%</td><td>59.96%</td></tr></tbody></table>

Any disruption in availability or significant increase in the pricing of these raw materials could materially raise our input costs and limit our ability to deliver products competitively.

Our exposure is further heightened by the volatility in raw material prices. Petrochemical-based raw materials, including polypropylene and aramid, are linked to global crude oil markets, which are inherently unstable. In Financial Years 2025, 2024 and 2023, raw material consumption represented approximately 61.15%, 61.89% and 59.96% of our revenue from operations, respectively. Any sharp increase in input costs without a corresponding ability to pass them on to customers may materially reduce our operating margins.

With increasing global demand for high-performance yarns that meet international standards of flame resistance, tensile strength and thermal stability, failure to innovate or upgrade our manufacturing systems could erode our competitive position.

Our operations are additionally subject to evolving domestic and international regulatory frameworks, including environmental compliance, quality certifications and import-export restrictions. Stricter regulations, delays in obtaining statutory approvals, or failure to maintain compliance may result in penalties, cancellation of orders, or reputational harm.

We also face customer concentration and competition risks. Our revenues are concentrated among a limited number of customers in niche industrial and protective textile applications. For Financial Years 2025, 2024 and 2023, our top ten customers contributed approximately 67.40%, 72.11% and 68.06% of our revenue from operations, respectively. As we do not have long-term agreements with these customers, any reduction, delay, or cancellation of orders could significantly affect our performance. Moreover, competition from international manufacturers may exert downward pressure on pricing and margins.

Given our substantial dependence on the performance of the technical textile yarn industry, any prolonged weakness in demand, raw material supply disruptions, regulatory hurdles, or customer concentration issues could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

5. Our business is heavily dependent on the sale of para-aramid based spun yarn and 100% polypropylene spun yarn. Any reduction in the sale of these yarns, or any inability on our part to produce and sell such yarns, or any adverse movement in the price at which we are able to sell these yarns, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of para-aramid based spun yarn and 100% polypropylene yarn. Our revenue from operations was ₹11,403.40 lakhs, ₹10,987.18 lakhs and ₹9,792.54 lakhs in the financial years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The revenue contribution from para-aramid based spun yarn was ₹2,722.31 lakhs (23.87%), ₹3,526.73 lakhs (32.10%) and ₹2,619.07 lakhs (26.75%) during the same periods. The revenue contribution from 100% polypropylene yarn was ₹2,581.87 lakhs (22.64%), ₹2,337.29 lakhs (21.27%) and ₹2,610.49 lakhs (26.66%) during the same periods.
