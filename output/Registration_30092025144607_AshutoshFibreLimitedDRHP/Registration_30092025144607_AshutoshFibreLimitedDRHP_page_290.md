## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risks during the normal course of business. Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate on account of changes in market prices. Market risk includes interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits.

### Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate on account of changes in market interest rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our short-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.

### Credit Risk

We are affected by inflation as it has an impact on the salary, wages, etc. In line with changing inflation rates, we rework our margins so as to absorb the inflationary impact.

### Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that we may not be able to meet our present and future obligations associated with financial liabilities that are required to be settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Our objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of working capital loans. We closely monitor our liquidity position. We aim to minimise these risks by generating sufficient cash flows from current operations, which in addition to the available cash and cash equivalents and sufficient committed fund facilities, will provide liquidity.
