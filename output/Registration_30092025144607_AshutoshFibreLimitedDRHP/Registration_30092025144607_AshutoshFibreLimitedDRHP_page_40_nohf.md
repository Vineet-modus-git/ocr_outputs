slowdowns, unscheduled shutdowns, power outages, labour unrest, mechanical breakdowns, fire accidents, natural disasters, or other disruptive events. Any such event could interrupt production and affect our ability to supply products to customers in a timely manner.

Further, one of the Objects of the Issue, as detailed in the chapter titled "Objects of the Issue" on page 92, is to fund the installation of equipment and machinery at the above facility to enhance our manufacturing capacity. While investments are being made to upgrade production capabilities, there can be no assurance that the new equipment will be commissioned as scheduled or that it will operate at the expected efficiency levels. Any delay in commissioning or inability to achieve optimal utilization may restrict our ability to derive the intended benefits from these investments and may adversely affect our expansion plans.

Our ability to maintain or improve operating margins is linked to the level of capacity utilization. Higher utilization enables fixed costs to be spread over a larger output, whereas lower utilization results in increased per-unit costs. Capacity utilization depends on multiple factors, including customer demand, the product mix, industry dynamics and internal production planning. If demand falls below estimates, if customers alter procurement practices, or if our production planning does not align with market requirements, the facilities may remain under-utilized, leading to inefficiencies and lower profitability. For further details of our installed capacity and production levels, please refer to the section titled "Our Business - Capacity and Capacity Utilization" on page 169.

Additionally, our entire manufacturing operations are concentrated at the Petlad, Gujarat facility. Geographic concentration of operations exposes us to location-specific risks such as labour unrest, regulatory changes at the state or local level, industrial accidents and natural calamities. Any event affecting this facility could materially disrupt production, supply capabilities and business continuity.

Accordingly, risks relating to under-utilization of our existing and proposed capacity, delays in commissioning or utilization of equipment and machinery funded through the Issue and concentration of our operations in a single leased facility may adversely affect our production volumes, revenues, cash flows and overall financial performance.

**17. We have experienced negative cash flows in the past. Any negative cash flows in the future would adversely affect our cash flow requirements, which may adversely affect our ability to operate our business and implement our growth plans, thereby affecting our financial condition.**

We have experienced negative cash flows in the recent past. The following table sets forth our cash flows for the period and fiscal years indicated as per our Restated Financial Statements:
