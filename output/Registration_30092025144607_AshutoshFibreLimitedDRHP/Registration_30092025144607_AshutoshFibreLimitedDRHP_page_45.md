capital, which could affect our financial condition and cash flows. For further details regarding loans availed by our Company, please refer “Financial Indebtedness” on page 231.

**25. Our high debt-equity ratio and dependence on working capital financing may adversely impact our financial flexibility and growth.**

As on March 31, 2025, our Company has a total debt-equity ratio of 1.60 times, reflecting a significant reliance on debt funding. Our business operations require substantial working capital and as of that date, we have availed loans including terms loans and working capital limits amounting to approximately ₹ 5,743.50 Lakhs.

We are undertaking a proposed expansion to purchase a new equipment and machinery to increase our production capacity, which we intend to fund from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (IPO).

Our ability to meet repayment obligations and manage our debt effectively is dependent on maintaining consistent profitability and sufficient liquidity. If our business growth does not align with expectations whether due to internal operational challenges or external market conditions it may impair our ability to service existing debt, which could have a negative impact on our profitability, financial condition and future growth.

**26. Our operations are concentrated in a single manufacturing facility located in Petlad, Gujarat and any disruption, slowdown, or regulatory challenge affecting this facility may materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.**

We currently carry out all of our manufacturing activities at one facility situated in Petlad, Gujarat. This concentration increases our exposure to risks associated with that region, including disruptions in local infrastructure, adverse weather, natural disasters, workforce interruptions, civil unrest and changes in local government policies or regulations. Like companies having multiple facilities, we do not have alternate manufacturing sites to mitigate the impact of such events, which could directly disrupt our production and supply chain.

Our operations are also subject to compliance with applicable labour, environmental, health and safety regulations of the State of Gujarat, in addition to central regulations. Any tightening of such norms, changes in compliance requirements, or delays in obtaining or renewing approvals may increase our costs, restrict operational flexibility, or require us to make significant changes to our processes. Failure to comply with applicable regulations may expose us to fines, penalties, or other sanctions.

In addition, our facility is exposed to operating risks beyond our control, such as equipment failure, industrial accidents, fires, power outages, or severe weather events. Past disruptions, such as those experienced by manufacturing units during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight the risks of reliance on a single facility. While our Company has not faced any such major disruption in the last three financial years, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur in the future. Any prolonged or repeated interruption in operations, or delays in repairing or replacing critical equipment, could force us to suspend or curtail production, impair our ability to meet delivery schedules and adversely affect relationships with customers and suppliers.

We may also be required to undertake planned shutdowns for maintenance or face shutdowns due to events beyond our control, such as pandemics, regulatory actions, social or political developments, power shortages, or delays in raw material supplies. Any such slowdown, disruption, or shutdown of our Petlad facility could materially adversely affect our production capacity, customer commitments, revenues and cash flows.

**27. Excessive attrition or loss of skilled personnel, including those engaged in our specialised manufacturing processes and Key Managerial Personnel, may adversely impact our operations, financial condition and results of operations.**

Our business is significantly dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, including skilled shop-floor employees, technical experts and Key Managerial Personnel (“KMPs”). Our manufacturing operations involve advanced processes such as insert company-specific specialised processes, e.g., blending, pelletising, pulverisation, flame-retardant treatment, etc.], which require technical know-how and practical expertise. The efficiency, quality and safety of our production, as well as our ability to meet customer specifications, depend heavily on employees with specialised skills who are trained to operate sophisticated equipment and adhere to stringent quality control protocols.

The training period for new recruits to become proficient in our specialised processes is relatively long and resource-intensive, thereby increasing our dependency on retaining skilled personnel. High attrition rates, or movement of trained employees to competitors, may lead to operational inefficiencies, production delays, higher rejection rates and disruption in fulfilling customer orders. Replacing such employees is costly and time-consuming, as newly recruited employees must undergo rigorous training before achieving optimal productivity.

At the corporate and managerial level, our strategy and growth initiatives rely on the continued services of our Key Managerial
