## 2. Export Obligation against EPCG Scheme

Our Company has also imported certain capital goods under the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) Scheme without payment of applicable customs duties. In accordance with the scheme requirements, we are required to fulfil a stipulated export obligation by exporting goods of a specified value, within the time frame prescribed under the scheme, equivalent to a multiple of the duty saved on such capital goods imports.

Compliance with these export obligations is essential to retain the benefits availed under the Advance Authorisation and EPCG schemes. Failure to meet the prescribed obligations may result in penalties, including the requirement to pay applicable duties along with interest. Our management continuously monitors and tracks fulfilment of such obligations to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
