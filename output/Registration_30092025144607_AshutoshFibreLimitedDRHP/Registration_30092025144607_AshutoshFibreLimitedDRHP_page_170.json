Typical products include filter fabrics, conveyor belts, coated fabrics and machine components, which are engineered to withstand high pressure, temperature and chemical exposure. These materials cater to industries such as metallurgy, chemicals, cement and mining.\n* **Protech:** Protective textiles designed to safeguard against physical, chemical, thermal, or biological hazards. Examples include flame-retardant garments, cut-resistant gloves, chemical protection suits and firefighter uniforms. These applications are critical for defense, fire services, metallurgy and hazardous industries and are aligned with the increasing focus on defense indigenization in India.\n* **Hometech:** Technical textiles applied in home and interior furnishing. Products include mattress covers, upholstery, sofa linings, carpets, curtains and fiberfill, offering properties such as flame retardancy, stain resistance and thermal insulation. Hometech, applications are also in demand in international markets, contributing to the broader global consumption of value-added home textiles.\n* **Mobiltech:** We manufacture friction resistant yarns that are primarily used in the production of automotive friction materials such as brake pads, clutch facings and transmission components. These yarns provide thermal stability, durability and resistance to abrasion, making them suitable for use in applications that require consistent performance under high mechanical stress and elevated temperatures."}, {"bbox": [110, 1922, 322, 1954], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## COMPETITION"}, {"bbox": [108, 1985, 1546, 2119], "category": "Text", "text": "The technical textile industry in which we operate is highly competitive and characterised by the presence of both organised and unorganised players, ranging from small-scale manufacturers to large integrated companies.
