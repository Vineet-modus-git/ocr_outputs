Construction textiles are essential for applications involving **soil stabilization, erosion control, waterproofing, sound and thermal insulation** and **structural reinforcement**. These specialized materials include **geogrids, drainage composites, concrete reinforcement fabrics** and **architectural membranes**, which enhance durability, safety and performance in buildings, roads, tunnels and water-management systems. The expanding public and private construction market thus represents a key domestic driver, creating predictable institutional demand for Indian technical textile producers by integrating these materials into infrastructure projects at scale.

India's oil and gas sector stands as one of the largest investment domains in the country, featuring around **275 investment opportunities worth over USD 100.71 billion**, including major projects in **refining (~USD 43.27 bn), pipelines (~USD 33.22 bn) and exploration & production (~USD 24.22 bn)**. As India seeks to expand its refining capacity by up to 75% by 2027 and construct a comprehensive gas grid spanning more than 22,300 km of natural gas pipelines and 8,228 km of petroleum pipelines, demand is accelerating for associated infrastructure materials.

This rapid development fuels demand for technical textiles used in **filtration media, insulation fabrics, protective covering, geotextiles** and **coating materials** required for pipeline installation, refinery linings and petrochemical processing. These specialized textiles improve durability, corrosion resistance, thermal insulation and contamination control in oil and gas applications, making them critical inputs for midstream and downstream infrastructure.

Moreover, India is forecasted to lead global oil demand growth through 2030, supported by expanding refining and pipeline networks and increased domestic fuel consumption. As energy infrastructure scales and new petrochemical complexes emerge in regions like Gujarat and Rajasthan, technical textile producers are well-positioned to capture this growing institutional demand, reinforcing the oil and gas sector as a significant downstream market enabler for India's technical textile ecosystem.

**Healthcare / Medical Sector:** Technical textile yarn demand in the Indian healthcare segment surged during the COVID-19 pandemic with essential products PPE kits, surgical masks and gowns, wound dressings and surgical drapes becoming critical to medical infrastructure. According to the Ministry of Textiles' India Vision 2047 roadmap, the Mobiltech and Meditech combined market was valued at approximately USD 21.95 billion in FY 2022, with Meditech (medical textiles) forming a key growth pillar highlighted in the National Technical Textiles Mission memos. The government's technical-textiles e-booklet also identifies medical dressings, absorbent cotton, surgical gowns, drapes and masks as priority segments under Meditech. Under NTTM's procurement guidelines, over 90 categories of technical textile products, including medical textiles, are now mandated for government health-sector use, supporting scalable domestic production. Increased healthcare investment and Make-in-India initiatives aim to further reduce import dependence India was the 6th-largest exporter of textiles and apparel in FY 2023, with medical textile output poised to form a larger share moving forward. These concerted efforts, backed by volume mandates and formalized procurement, are driving substantial demand for high-performance technical textile yarns in India's rapidly growing medical textiles sector.

## REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

The technical textile yarns industry in India functions within a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to uphold product quality, drive innovation and enhance the sector's global competitiveness. As technical textiles play a critical role in diverse strategic sectors such as defence, automotive, healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture and environmental protection, the Government of India has implemented targeted regulatory measures and policy interventions to support the sector's growth. These include standardization mandates, fiscal incentives and environmental compliance norms aimed at fostering domestic manufacturing, encouraging R&D and facilitating export readiness. The regulatory ecosystem not only ensures adherence to quality and safety benchmarks but also aligns the industry with national priorities like sustainability, pollution control and import substitution positioning India as a key player in the global technical textiles market.
