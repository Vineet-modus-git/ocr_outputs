The Market Making arrangement, trading and other related aspects including all those specified above shall be subject to the applicable provisions of law and / or norms issued by SEBI / NSE from time to time.

## WITHDRAWAL OF THE ISSUE

Our Company in consultation with the Book Running Lead Manager, reserve the right not to proceed with the Issue at any time after the Issue Opening Date but before the Board meeting for Allotment. In such an event our Company would issue a public notice in the newspapers, in which the pre-Issue advertisements were published, within 2 (Two) days of the Issue Closing Date or such other time as may be prescribed by SEBI, providing reasons for not proceeding with the Issue.

The Book Running Lead Manager, through the Registrar to the Issue, shall notify the SCSBs (in case of II's using the UPI Mechanism), to unblock the bank accounts of the ASBA Applicants, within 1 (One) day of receipt of such notification. Our Company shall also promptly inform the Stock Exchange on which the Equity Shares were proposed to be listed.

If our Company withdraws the Issue after the Bid/ Issue Closing Date and subsequently decides to proceed with an Issue of the Equity Shares, our Company will have to file a fresh Draft Red Herring Prospectus with the stock exchange where the Equity Shares may be proposed to be listed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issue is also subject to obtaining the final listing and trading approvals from NSE, which our Company shall apply for after Allotment. If our Company withdraws the Issue after the Issue Closing Date and thereafter determines that it will proceed with an IPO, our Company shall be required to file a fresh Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
