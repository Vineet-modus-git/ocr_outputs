As on date of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there are no Partly Paid-up Shares and all the Equity Shares of our Company are fully paid up.

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we do not have any Employees Stock Option Scheme / Employees Stock Purchase Scheme/ Stock Appreciation Right Scheme and we do not intend to allot any shares to our employees under Employee Stock Option Scheme/ Employee Stock Purchase Plan/Stock Appreciation Right from the proposed Issue.\n28. An over-subscription to the extent of 10% of the Issue can be retained for the purpose of rounding off to the nearest integer during finalizing the allotment, subject to minimum allotment, which is the minimum application size in this Issue. Consequently, the actual allotment may go up by a maximum of 10% of the Issue, as a result of which, the post-Issue paid up capital after the Issue would also increase by the excess amount of allotment so made. In such an event, the Equity Shares held by the Promoters and subject to lock-in shall be suitably increased; so as to ensure that 20% of the post Issue paid-up capital is locked in.\n29. Under-subscription, if any, in any category, except in the QIB Portion, would be allowed to be met with spill over from any other category or a combination of categories at the discretion of our Company, in consultation with the BRLM and the Designated Stock Exchange. Such inter-se spill over, if any, would be effected in accordance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines. Under-subscription, if any, in the QIB Portion will not be allowed to be met with spill over from any category or combination thereof.\n30. In case of over-subscription in all categories the allocation in the issue shall be as per the requirements of Regulation 253 of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018 and its amendments from time to time.\n31.
