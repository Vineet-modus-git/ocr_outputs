## BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Our Company commenced operations in the trading of textile yarns and fabrics. In 1995, the ownership changed through transfer of shares to the current promoter group and manufacturing activities began in 2000. Until 2006-07, trading continued to contribute significantly to operations, after which manufacturing became the primary focus. In 2010, additional shareholders with relevant industry experience joined the Company, supporting the expansion of manufacturing capabilities. We are presently engaged in the manufacture of various technical and synthetic yarns from our facility located at Petlad, Gujarat.

Technical textiles are textile materials and products manufactured primarily to deliver specific technical performance and functional properties, rather than for aesthetic or decorative purposes. These products are engineered to meet defined performance requirements such as durability, tensile strength, flame resistance, thermal insulation, or moisture control, depending on the intended use. They are applied across various industrial, protective and specialised end uses, where functional attributes are more important than appearance.

We operate in four categories of technical textiles (i) Indutech, (ii) Protech, (iii) Hometech and (iv) Mobiltech. In the Indutech segment, our products cater to industrial applications such as filtration, geotextiles and process industry textiles. One of our key products in this segment is polypropylene spun yarn, manufactured from polypropylene fibres that are lightweight, chemically resistant, have low moisture absorption and provide good abrasion resistance. These properties make it suitable for use in filter cartridges, filter cloths, ropes, webbings and other industrial applications where chemical stability and dimensional integrity are required. In the Protech segment, we manufacture yarns and fabrics with inherent properties such as strength, flame retardancy and heat resistance, used in personal protective equipment, safety apparel and industrial thermal barriers. In the Hometech segment, our yarns are used in home furnishing textiles, carpets and home filtration media. In Mobiltech segment, we manufacture friction resistant yarns that are primarily used in the production of automotive friction materials such as brake pads, clutch facings and transmission components.

Our Company operates on a business to business (B2B) business model. We supply our yarns and fabrics to industrial manufacturers, processors and institutional buyers. Our products are used as raw material inputs across industries such as filtration and pollution control (gas and liquid filter media, filter cartridges, filter cloths), construction and infrastructure (geotextiles, ropes, webbings), automotive (friction materials, thermal insulation, seat fabrics), packaging (antistatic FIBC), safety and protective equipment (flame-retardant clothing, industrial protective wear, PPE kits) and home furnishing (carpets, upholstery, curtains and home filtration media). We customize products based on client requirements and supply in accordance with technical
