Accordingly, we intend to utilise a portion of the Net Proceeds from the Issue, amounting to ₹2,495.75 lakhs, towards the purchase and installation of additional equipment and machinery at our existing manufacturing facility.

## A. Expansion of Manufacturing Facilities:

Our manufacturing unit is located at Building Nos. 27, 28, and 29, City Survey No. 156, Station Road, Village Petlad, Ahmedabad – 388 450, Gujarat, India. The facility is spread over an area of approximately 53,988.88 square meters, of which approximately 20,570.89 square meters is currently utilised for operations.

To cater to growing domestic and international demand, we propose to enhance our manufacturing capabilities through the installation of advanced machinery and industrial equipment. The proposed expansion is expected to:

* Substantially increase the production capacity of our existing facility;

* Improve overall operational efficiency; and

* Enable the manufacture of a broader and more specialised range of yarns, including:

* Para-aramid yarns for protective and industrial applications;

* Flame-retardant yarns for protective clothing and furnishings;

* High-tenacity polyester and nylon yarns for automotive, construction, and other industrial uses;

* Speciality blended yarns (e.g., aramids, viscose, and other fibres) for filtration and insulation; and

* Technical yarns for gloves, conveyor belts, tarpaulins, coated fabrics, and other industrial applications.

This expansion is aligned with our strategic objective of strengthening our position in the technical textiles market while maintaining a focus on quality, performance, and innovation.

## B. Operational and Financial Performance

Over the past three financial years, our Company has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, with revenue from operations increasing from ₹ 9,792.54 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 11,403.40 lakhs in Fiscal 2025. This growth has been primarily driven by increased demand for our specialised yarn products.

In Fiscal 2025, synthetic yarns (up to 50 NE) stood at 3,247 MT in Fiscal 2025, compared to 2,704 MT in Fiscal 2023 with capacity utilisation improving to 86.58% compared to 77.25% in Fiscal 2023.

Meanwhile, the production of 100% polypropylene yarns (up to 2 NE) stood at 653 MT in Fiscal 2025, compared to 772 MT in Fiscal 2023, with capacity utilisation ranging between 63.75% and 75.34% during the period.

These trends indicate a growing demand for our core product offerings and underline the need for increased capacity and technological upgradation. Against an estimated demand of 120 MT, our Company is currently able to manufacture only 55 MT, thereby meeting approximately 44% of the demand. This gap demonstrates the significant scope for expanding our manufacturing facilities by purchasing and installing additional machinery to cater to the rising market requirement.

Our existing capacity utilization is already at relatively high levels; therefore, the proposed capacity expansion is being undertaken in view of anticipated demand growth, operational efficiency, technological upgradation, and to mitigate future capacity constraints. The rationale for expansion and the expected capacity utilization post the proposed capital expenditure has been duly assessed and forms part of our business strategy. For more information regarding the proposed capacity utilization, refer to “Our Business – Capacity and Capacity Utilization” and “Our Business – Business Strategy” on page 169 and 151 respectively.
