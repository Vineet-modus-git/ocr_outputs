textiles, synthetic fibers and filtration fabrics. It totalled exports to India were priced at ₹ 4,950 lakhs and thus it retained the fourth position at the global import destinations of India. Korean suppliers offer a balance of quality and affordability, making them an attractive option for Indian industries looking for reliable mid-range technical solutions. The country's expertise in high-performance materials and strong trade ties with India help maintain its relevance in this niche import segment.

## Italy

Italy rounds out at fifth amongst the top five, leveraging its specialization in engineered textiles and innovative production techniques. Italian imports are particularly valued in high-end industrial design, luxury automotive interiors and niche construction materials and costed around ₹ 4,890 lakhs in FY 2025. Italian manufacturers emphasize sustainability and aesthetic value along with functionality, which aligns with evolving Indian preferences for eco-friendly and high-performance products. Their role is especially prominent in sectors that merge performance with design sophistication.

**Analysis of regulatory / other factors that has an impact on trade:**

### Mandatory Quality Control Orders (QCOs) and BIS Certification:

The Indian government has introduced Quality Control Orders (QCOs) for several categories of technical textiles to ensure product safety, reliability and compliance with performance standards. Imported products falling under these QCOs must obtain BIS certification, which may pose a challenge for foreign suppliers unfamiliar with Indian regulatory processes. This step, while ensuring quality, can increase import lead times and add compliance costs.

### Customs Duties and Tariff Structure:

Import of technical textile products is subject to Basic Customs Duty (BCD), Integrated GST (IGST) and other charges depending on the product classification. While some inputs may attract lower duties, others face moderate to high tariffs impacting the landed cost. The tariff structure plays a crucial role in determining sourcing decisions, especially when balancing cost versus quality across different supplier countries.

### Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and Preferential Access:

India's FTAs with ASEAN countries, South Korea (CEPA) and Japan provide tariff concessions that facilitate easier and more cost-effective imports of technical textiles. These agreements allow Indian industries to access high-quality raw materials and finished technical textile products at reduced duties, particularly from technologically advanced countries, supporting sectors like automotive, filtration and protective textiles.

### Incentives for Import Substitution (PLI & Make in India):

Government initiatives like the **Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Technical Textiles** aim to boost domestic manufacturing capacity. While the long-term goal is to reduce reliance on imports, these programs may gradually shift demand toward locally produced alternatives. In the short to medium term, however, gaps in local capability continue to drive imports for specific high-performance textile products.

### Digital Customs Reforms and Trade Facilitation:

Recent improvements in customs infrastructure such as the introduction of faceless assessment, the ICEGATE portal and single-window clearance have made the import process more efficient and transparent. These digital reforms have helped reduce dwell times and administrative bottlenecks, facilitating smoother and faster entry of critical technical textile materials into India. The political developments of latest times have been a concern as a country's imposition of tariff policies.
