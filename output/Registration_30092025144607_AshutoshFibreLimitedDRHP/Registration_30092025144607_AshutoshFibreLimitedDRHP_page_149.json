In the Indutech segment, our products cater to industrial applications such as filtration, geotextiles and process industry textiles. One of our key products in this segment is polypropylene spun yarn, manufactured from polypropylene fibres that are lightweight, chemically resistant, have low moisture absorption and provide good abrasion resistance. These properties make it suitable for use in filter cartridges, filter cloths, ropes, webbings and other industrial applications where chemical stability and dimensional integrity are required. In the Protech segment, we manufacture yarns and fabrics with inherent properties such as strength, flame retardancy and heat resistance, used in personal protective equipment, safety apparel and industrial thermal barriers. In the Hometech segment, our yarns are used in home furnishing textiles, carpets and home filtration media. In Mobiltech segment, we manufacture friction resistant yarns that are primarily used in the production of automotive friction materials such as brake pads, clutch facings and transmission components."}, {"bbox": [110, 1586, 1543, 1812], "category": "Text", "text": "Our Company operates on a business to business (B2B) business model.
