India's technical textile sector has gained strategic importance in recent years, transitioning from a niche category to a key focus area for industrial modernization and import substitution. These textiles designed for functional and performance based use are increasingly integrated into essential industries such as transportation, Industrial, healthcare, environmental protection, packaging, defence and civil engineering.

Driven by advancements in material science and changing market needs, technical textiles are enabling product innovation and efficiency across a wide range of applications. The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption, supported by policy interventions, rising awareness among end-users and growing emphasis on safety, hygiene and sustainability.

Indian Textile Industry has been using technical yarns in the early 2000s. The yarns primarily used in India were of jute silk, cotton, but with advent of technical yarns variety of man-made (synthetic) fibers such as polyester, nylon, aramid, glass, carbon and PTFE(Polytetrafluoroethylene). The technical yarn usage is driven by growing demand by highly efficient industrial textile, inclination of consumers towards athleisure apparels and acceptance of eco-friendly materials such as recycled or regenerated fibres. Apparently, India has turned out to be one of the top producers of technical yarn materials like para-aramid yarn, meta-aramid yarn, modacrylic-blended yarns, peroxidised PAN yarn, antistatic polypropylene yarn, DREF-spun yarns, polyester and FR viscose blends.

Textile Industry majorly uses natural synthetic yarns as mentioned above. The features and the benefits of these yarns decide its end use.:

## Types of Yarn used in the Indian textile Industry

The yarns used in the textile industry are divided into natural and man-made. Predominantly, technical textiles have evolved with use of natural fibres such as Cotton, silk, jute, wool.

### Cotton:

India has turned out to be one of the largest producers, consumers and exporters of the material. It provides livelihood to 6 million cultivators and many others who are employed in the related activities. The government has extended support by allotting Minimum support Price for two variants of cotton crops.

### Jute:

Providing directly and indirectly employment to approximately 4 million farm families majorly in the eastern region of the country. It is one of the largest producers of raw jute. Similar to cotton crop, Jute sector also has support prices from the government. In addition to this, direct purchase of jute sacks, e-platform for supply management and requisition is also implemented. Jute is majorly used in making of sacks used by agro processing industry and used in combination with other yarns such as cotton and silk to make raw materials for garments.

### Silk:

One of the major contributions from India to the world was silk, which reigned the textiles in the ancient civilizations. India is the second largest producer of silk and the largest consumer as well. Four varieties of silk are produced for commercial purposes namely Mulberry, Tropical & Oak Tasar, Muga & Eri. Major uses are in textile industries to make sarees, shawls and other key textile pieces.

### Wool:

Wool is majorly used for winter clothing, carpets and used in Industries. Extracted from the third largest sheep population, India has made its place as one of the top ten wool producer in the world. The wool extracted is classified into 3 categories based in its major uses I, e Carpet making (majorly), Textile industry and Coarse grade (second largest sector).

## The man-made fibers are Polyester, Viscose and Nylon.

**Polyester** – Made from petroleum-based materials such as ethylene glycol, it is considered as one of the durable, synthetic material fibre made. Its major uses are in clothing, home décor materials such as curtains, pillowcases etc. Its properties such as anti-wrinkling and quicker drying make it suitable to use even in technical textiles industry.

**Viscose** – It is made from chemically treated wood pulp making it a regenerated cellulose fibre. It has similar properties to cotton and silk i.e., softness, light weight and quick absorbing. Due to these benefits, it is widely used in manufacturing of medical products, home décor furnishings and in making clothing.

### Nylon:

This yarn variety is made from raw materials derived from Petrochemicals such as adipic acid & hexamethylene diamine which are processed and spun into fibres. The major use of nylon is in active wear, sportswear, industrial products and technical textiles. There are many more synthetic fibres which are developed for specific application across industries.
