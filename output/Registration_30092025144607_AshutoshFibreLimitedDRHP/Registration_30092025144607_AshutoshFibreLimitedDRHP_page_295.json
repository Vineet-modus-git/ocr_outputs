The Petitioners contended that they had already complied with the rehabilitation scheme sanctioned by the BIFR on March 15, 2007 in Case No. 192 of 2007, under which State dues including sales tax and electricity duty were crystallized at ₹176.59 lakhs, fully paid by the Petitioners and acknowledged in subsequent BIFR orders dated January 12, 2009, August 4, 2009 and December 9, 2009. Despite this, the impugned notice was issued, leading to freezing of the Petitioners' bank accounts. The Petition seeks quashing of the demand notice and a direction to the State to issue a \"No Dues Certificate\" as per the sanctioned scheme. During the pendency of the writ, the Government of Gujarat introduced the Tax Compromise Scheme, 2019 vide G.R. dated September 11, 2019 and the Petitioners, through Civil Application No. 1 of 2019, expressed willingness to apply under the said scheme by seeking withdrawal of the claims relating to sales tax dues in the petition, with liberty to revive or file fresh proceedings if required.
