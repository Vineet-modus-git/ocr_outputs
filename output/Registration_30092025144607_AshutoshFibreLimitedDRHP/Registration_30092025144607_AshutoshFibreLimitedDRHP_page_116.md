Several of these benefits are dependent on the Company, its shareholders fulfilling the conditions prescribed under the relevant statutory provisions. Hence, the ability of the Company and its shareholders identified as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirement) Regulations, 2015, to derive the tax benefits is dependent upon fulfilling such conditions, which based on business imperatives the Company faces in the future, the Company may or may not choose to fulfil.

While the term '**special tax benefits**' has not been defined under the SEBI ICDR Regulations, for the purpose of this Statement, it is assumed that with respect to special tax benefits available to the Company, the same would include those benefits as enumerated in the **Annexure A**. Any benefits under the taxation laws other than those specified in **Annexure A** are considered to be general tax benefits and therefore not covered within the ambit of this Statement. Further, any benefits available under any other laws within or outside India, except for those mentioned in the **Annexure A** have not been examined and covered by this statement.

The benefits discussed in the enclosed Statement are not exhaustive. The Statement is only intended to provide general information to the investors and is neither designed nor intended to be a substitute for professional tax advice. In view of the individual nature of the tax consequences and changing tax laws, each investor is advised to consult his or her own tax consultant with respect to the specific tax implications arising out of their participation in the Issue.

In respect of non-residents, the tax rates and the consequent taxation shall be further subject to any benefits available under the applicable Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, if any, between India and the country in which the non-resident has fiscal domicile.

We do not express any opinion or provide any assurance as to whether:

1. the Company or its shareholders will continue to obtain these benefits in the future; or

2. the conditions prescribed for availing of the benefits, where applicable have been/would be met with.

3. The revenue authorities/courts will concur with the views expressed herein.

The contents of the enclosed Statement are based on information, explanations and representations obtained from the Company and on the basis of our understanding of the business activities and operations of the Company.
