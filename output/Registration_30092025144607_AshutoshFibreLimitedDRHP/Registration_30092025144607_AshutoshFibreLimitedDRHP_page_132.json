These products are specially designed to meet specific performance requirements across various industrial sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, construction, transportation, defence, Industrial, packaging and environmental protection. Depending on their end use, technical textiles offer benefits such as high tensile strength, thermal resistance, flame retardancy, chemical stability, durability and lightweight characteristics making them indispensable in both industrial and consumer applications. As industrial activity continues to grow, the demand for high-performance technical textiles particularly in **transport, industrial and defence use cases** has steadily increased."}, {"bbox": [108, 398, 1544, 599], "category": "Text", "text": "In India, the technical textile sector has emerged as a **key growth driver within the broader textile industry**, backed by a confluence of factors such as rising domestic demand, increased awareness and government push. The **National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM)**, launched in 2020 with an outlay of ₹1.48 lakhs till date, has significantly boosted this segment through targeted interventions in R&D, education, standardization and market development. Additionally, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, import substitution policies and mandatory usage mandates for products like geotextiles and agrotextiles in public infrastructure projects are catalysing industrial adoption."}, {"bbox": [108, 625, 1544, 856], "category": "Text", "text": "According to a 2022, **baseline survey conducted under the NTTM**, technical textiles currently contribute about **15% to India's overall textiles and apparel output**, signalling a strong shift toward value-added manufacturing. The establishment of **Centres of Excellence (CoEs)**, development of indigenous standards through the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and promotion of private sector innovation are improving quality, compliance and global competitiveness. With its vast raw material base, skilled labour and supportive policy framework, India is not only meeting its domestic requirements but is also expanding its export footprint in high-performance technical textile applications.
