Key players such as Reliance Chemotex Industries Limited, Garvare Technical fibre, Cedaar Textile Limited and RSWM Limited have established a strong presence in the production of high-tenacity polyester, nylon, polypropylene and other performance-oriented yarns. These companies are increasingly focusing on niche applications including geotextiles, automotive fabrics, medical textiles and filtration media. While large firms often operate across the entire value chain—from polymers to finished fabrics—many smaller players operate in focused verticals, supplying yarns tailored to specific technical applications."}, {"bbox": [109, 1066, 1545, 1263], "category": "Text", "text": "Competition in this segment is largely based on the ability to produce yarns with functional attributes such as flame resistance, UV stability, chemical resistance and tensile strength. As demand rises for advanced products like conductive yarns, aramids and carbon-based fibers, Indian manufacturers are exploring both domestic R&D and technology collaborations to stay competitive. However, some high-performance yarns—such as aramids and UHMWPE—continue to be imported due to the absence of local manufacturing capacity. Companies that can develop indigenous substitutes or enhance yarn properties through blending and finishing are likely to secure a competitive advantage in specialized markets."}, {"bbox": [109, 1290, 1545, 1487], "category": "Text", "text": "Innovation and R&D remain essential but underdeveloped areas for many Indian firms in this segment.
