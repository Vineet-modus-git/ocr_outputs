Instead of passing through the subsequent three stages Roving Frame, Ring Frame and Doubling the fibres move directly into the friction spinning system.<br/>In this method, fibres are fed onto a rotating drum or perforated surface, where air suction and surface friction twist them together to form yarn. This technology offers several advantages.<ul><li><strong>Versatility in blending:</strong> Enables the combination of diverse fibre types, including metallic, synthetic and natural fibres.</li><li><strong>High bulk and strength:</strong> Produce yarns with enhanced bulk and strength, suitable for demanding applications.</li><li><strong>Specialty end-uses:</strong> Particularly effective for yarns used in filtration, protective clothing and industrial textiles.</li></ul>After this step, friction spun yarns are subjected directly to quality testing, bypassing the conventional intermediate spinning processes.</td><td><img src=\"\" alt=\"DREF Spinning Machine\"/><br/>DREF Spinning Machine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Roving Frame:</strong><br/>The Roving Frame is the next step in the manufacture of Ring Spun Yarn. The sliver emerging from the draw frame is relatively thick and, in its existing form, is unsuitable for direct conversion into yarn. The primary purpose of this stage is to prepare an input package that can be efficiently handled in the subsequent Ring Frame process.<br/>At this stage, the sliver is further drafted to reduce its thickness while maintaining fibre alignment and uniformity. Simultaneously, a small amount of twist is inserted to impart strength, preventing fibre breakage during handling. The roving thus formed is wound onto bobbins, which are designed for secure placement on Ring Frames for the final spinning operation.<br/>The material produced at this stage is referred to as roving and it serves as a crucial intermediate between drawing and final yarn spinning.<br/><strong>Quality Testing:</strong> During the roving process, quality testing is done by checking U% Evenness, Hank and Hank variation, consistency of the roving thickness and weight and count testing to ensure that roving is suitable for next spinning stage.</td><td><img src=\"\" alt=\"Roving Frame\"/><br/>Roving Frame</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [1011, 146, 1535, 745], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1011, 808, 1521, 1022], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1011, 1453, 1535, 1782], "category": "Picture"}]
