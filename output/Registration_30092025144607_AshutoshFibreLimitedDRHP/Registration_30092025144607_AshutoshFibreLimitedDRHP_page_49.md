Any prolonged disruption in Gujarat may lead to higher procurement costs, production delays, or supply chain interruptions, which may in turn affect our ability to meet customer demand. At the same time, a slowdown in regional demand could materially reduce our revenues. Together, these factors could materially and adversely impact our profitability, cash flows and financial condition.

**35. The Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk and any delay in receiving payments or non-receipt of payments may adversely impact business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.**

Our Company extends credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and is therefore exposed to counterparty credit risk arising from delays in collection or non-receipt of receivables. Any significant delay in realizing dues, or write-offs on account of customer defaults, disputes or insolvency, may adversely affect our revenues, liquidity position, working capital requirements and results of operations.

Our ability to collect receivables depends on multiple factors, including the creditworthiness of our customers, accuracy and timeliness of invoicing and documentation, adherence to delivery specifications and overall conditions in the industries we serve. Although we undertake credit assessments and monitor outstanding balances, there is no assurance that such measures will be sufficient in all circumstances or that we will be able to identify deterioration in a customer's financial condition in a timely manner.

We recognize expected credit loss provisions in accordance with Ind AS 109, based on historical loss experience, current conditions and forward-looking information. Any adverse changes in customer risk profiles, economic slowdowns or sectoral stress may require us to increase provisioning, which could negatively impact profitability.

Our receivables may also become overdue due to product acceptance timelines, inspection or quality disputes, or documentation and logistics issues in cross-border transactions. Prolonged ageing of receivables increases our reliance on short-term borrowings and raises finance costs. Breach of financial covenants due to elongated receivable cycles could also restrict our access to credit.

While we have historically not experienced material bad-debt losses, we cannot assure that delays or defaults will not occur in the future. If large customers delay payments or default, or if we are required to grant extended credit terms, our cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.

**36. We have availed unsecured loans that may be recalled at any time. Our Company has availed unsecured loans which are repayable on demand. Any demand from lender(s) for repayment of such unsecured loans, may adversely affect our cash flows.**

We have availed unsecured loans which are repayable on demand. Any demand from the lender(s) for repayment of such loans could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. As these borrowings do not have a fixed repayment schedule and may be recalled at any time, there can be no assurance that the lenders will not recall such borrowings, or that we would be able to arrange alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

As of March 31, 2025, our outstanding unsecured loans aggregated ₹ 2,091.97 lakhs, comprising ₹ 2,091.97 lakhs from related parties and ₹ 0.00 lakhs from others. These loans are unsecured, carry interest in the range of 10% to 12% per annum (where applicable) and ₹ 1,336.98 lakhs is repayable on demand and ₹ 755.00 lakhs is repayable after 6 years to the respective lenders. There is no agreed amortisation schedule for such loans.

If any of these lenders were to recall their loans and we are unable to refinance the same, we may be required to utilise internal accruals or working capital lines to meet such obligations, which could constrain funds available for operations and growth. Any forced prepayment could also increase our finance costs if replacement funding is available only at higher rates.

Since these loans are repayable on demand, they are classified as current liabilities in our financial statements and may adversely affect certain financial ratios, including the current ratio and debt-related covenants, which could further limit our access to additional borrowings.

Unsecured loans, by their nature, rank junior to our secured borrowings to the extent of applicable security interests. In the event of any enforcement action by secured creditors, unsecured lenders may have limited recourse to assets subject to security and any accelerated repayment demands by unsecured lenders could aggravate liquidity pressures.

To the extent these loans are from related parties, any change in our relationship with such parties, or their liquidity position, could result in withdrawal of financial support at short notice. There is no assurance that such support will continue in the future. Any such event could adversely affect our business, cash flows and financial condition.
