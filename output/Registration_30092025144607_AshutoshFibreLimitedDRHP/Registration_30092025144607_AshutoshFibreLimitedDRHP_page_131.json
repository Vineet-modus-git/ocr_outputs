This strong growth reflects a shift toward performance driven and application specific textiles, supported by increased awareness among industries about their benefits. Key contributing factors include rising adoption in infrastructure projects (such as road construction using geotextiles), healthcare demand post-COVID-19 (especially for Meditech and PPE) and greater emphasis on sustainability and safety regulations across sectors. Additionally, government support through initiatives like **mandatory quality control orders**, **PLI schemes** and **public procurement preferences** has accelerated domestic production and investment, while global supply chain realignments have opened new export opportunities for Indian manufacturers."}, {"bbox": [108, 554, 409, 589], "category": "Section-header", "text": "# GROWTH FORECAST"}, {"bbox": [108, 619, 780, 655], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Expected growth in the technical textile market in India"}, {"bbox": [108, 683, 1542, 909], "category": "Text", "text": "India's technical textile industry is expected to witness sustained growth in the coming years, not just due to industrial applications but also because of broader structural and policy-level shifts.
