This ensures removal of any residual faults and prepares yarn in customer-specified package size and shape (cones, tubes, cheeses).<br><strong>Packaging</strong>- After winding, the yarn is packed in protective material (cartons, HDPE bags, or shrink-wraps) to preserve quality during storage and transport. The yarn packages are labeled with count, ply, lot/batch number and other specifications for traceability.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quality Testing:</strong> Once the yarn manufacturing process is complete, it undergoes a comprehensive series of quality checks to ensure that only material conforming to customer specifications and industry standards is packed and dispatched. These tests include:<br>1. <strong>Wrap Reel Test:</strong> It is used to determine the count and weight of yarn. This process ensures that the yarn produced corresponds to the specific weight and count necessary to achieve the customer's desired fabric weight. Accurate count verification guarantees that woven or knitted fabrics meet both performance and quality requirements.<br>2. <strong>Lea Strength / CSP / RKM - Strength Testing:</strong> This test evaluates the tensile strength of both single yarn and lea yarn (a standard bundle of yarn). It is conducted using the CSP-RKM Strength Testing Machine, which measures critical strength parameters such as Count Strength Product (CSP) and Resistance per Kilometer (RKM). These parameters ensure that the yarn possesses sufficient strength to endure subsequent textile processes such as weaving, knitting and dyeing, while also meeting the durability and performance expectations of the end product.<br>3. <strong>Yarn Twist Testing:</strong> This test measures the number of twists per unit length in the yarn and is conducted using a Yarn Twist Tester Machine. Twist plays a critical role in binding fibres together, directly influencing yarn strength, elasticity and durability. Proper assessment through this machine ensures that the yarn has adequate structural integrity to endure downstream textile operations such as weaving, knitting, or dyeing without compromising the quality and performance of the final fabric.<br>4. <strong>Yarn Evenness Testing:</strong> This test is carried out using the Mesdan Evenness Tester. At the final stage of production, the machine provides a second check on the quality of yarn by measuring parameters such as unevenness, thick and thin places, neps and hairiness. Ensuring minimal unevenness is critical, as high variability can reduce yarn strength, increase breakages during weaving or knitting and negatively impact the overall appearance and performance of the final fabric.<br>5. <strong>Yarn Fault Classification:</strong> This test is conducted using the Classimat Machine, which employs advanced sensors to detect and classify yarn faults. It measures defects such as thick places, thin places, neps and other irregularities and evaluates their severity and length. The data generated provides valuable insights into the origins of faults during the spinning process and offers predictive information on how these faults may affect the appearance and performance of the final fabric.<br>6. <strong>Splice Strength Testing:</strong> This test is conducted using the Splice</td><td><img src=\"imagewrap_reel.png\" alt=\"Wrap Reel\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><img src=\"imagecsp_rkm.png\" alt=\"CSP-RKM Strength Testing Machine\"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><img src=\"imagetwisttester.png\" alt=\"Yarn Twist Tester Machine\"></td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [1011, 146, 1367, 652], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1009, 706, 1343, 958], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1011, 971, 1145, 1005], "category": "Caption", "text": "Wrap Reel"}, {"bbox": [1009, 1023, 1525, 1501], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1011, 1514, 1461, 1550], "category": "Caption", "text": "CSP-RKM Strength Testing Machine"}, {"bbox": [997, 1587, 1490, 1844], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1018, 1866, 1351, 1900], "category": "Caption", "text": "Yarn Twist Tester Machine"}]
