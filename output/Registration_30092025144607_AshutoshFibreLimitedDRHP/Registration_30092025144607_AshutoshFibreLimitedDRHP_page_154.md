We have installed a dedicated regenerating machine for high-strength fibres, which supports our proprietary “Fabric-to-Fibre” recycling process. This enables us to carefully break down and reconstitute aramid fabrics while retaining critical performance properties such as tensile strength and thermal resistance. The recycled fibres produced through this process are utilised in high-performance applications, including brake pads, clutch facings, filtration media and protective textiles. By undertaking this recycling, we extend the life cycle of aramid fibres and provide our customers with sustainable, cost-efficient and reliable alternatives to virgin fibres.

Our recycling initiative is aligned with circular economy principles and supports the sustainability expectations of global customers. At the same time, it creates operational advantages for us by reducing dependence on imported virgin fibres and lowering raw material costs. By converting discarded high-performance waste into reusable inputs, we are able to combine environmental responsibility with operational efficiency, strengthening our position in the technical yarn segment.

## Positioning in Polypropylene Spun Yarns

We are engaged in the manufacture of polypropylene (PP) spun yarns, which form a key part of our product portfolio and are used in both household and industrial applications. Polypropylene fibres are valued for their properties of light weight, high strength-to-weight ratio, resistance to chemicals and low moisture absorption, making them well-suited for filtration media, geotextiles, insulation products and protective technical textiles.

Our polypropylene yarns are manufactured using advanced spinning technologies that enable us to offer a wide range of counts and plies in both single and multiple-end formats. This flexibility allows us to cater to varied customer specifications across industries that demand durability, consistency and technical performance. Our Company has developed a presence in the polypropylene yarn segment in India, supported by its production capabilities and customer relationships.

The polypropylene yarn segment contributes materially to our revenues, particularly from customers in the filtration and technical textile sectors. For the Financial Years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, sales of polypropylene yarns accounted for approximately 22.64%, 21.27% and 26.66% of our revenue from operations, respectively.

We expect demand for polypropylene yarns to grow in line with the increasing use of water filtration systems, infrastructure-related applications such as geotextiles and specialised industrial textiles.

## Strong Customer and Supplier Relationships

We rely on an established base of suppliers to source the raw materials required for our technical yarn operations, including pararamid inputs that are essential to our recycling and regeneration process. Sourcing of such technical fibres is highly specialised and access to consistent supply is critical for ensuring uninterrupted production. Our supplier relationships help us secure timely deliveries, maintain quality standards and optimise procurement costs. A significant portion of our raw material requirements is met through our top 5 suppliers, with whom we have maintained long-standing relationships.

On the customer side, our emphasis on quality, process reliability and timely delivery has enabled us to build and maintain long-standing relationships across industries such as household and industrial water filtration, automotive friction materials and protective technical textiles. These industries are characterised by stringent compliance requirements and our ability to consistently meet these benchmarks has resulted in a high proportion of repeat business. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from our top 5 customers, reflecting stability in our business while also demonstrating a balanced distribution of revenues across our customer portfolio.

These relationships, both on the supply and customer side, provide us with stability in raw material procurement, visibility of revenues through recurring orders and opportunities to scale our operations in a sustainable manner.

## Strong focus on quality control and product consistency

We maintain a strong emphasis on quality control across our manufacturing processes, which are aligned with stringent standards required for technical yarns. Our production facility is equipped with advanced testing and monitoring equipment, including the Mesdan Evenness Tester for real-time measurement of yarn uniformity, tensile strength and other performance parameters. We also employ the Pinter Hard Core attachment system, which enhances core yarn strength and enables the production of specialty and high-torque yarns.

Our focus on quality control enables us to deliver yarns with consistent technical performance, reducing wastage and ensuring compliance with customer specifications. This capability is particularly important in industries such as filtration, automotive friction materials and protective textiles, where reliability and safety are critical. By minimising defects and rejections, we are able to improve customer satisfaction while also achieving better operating margins.
