The Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 ("IT Intermediary Rules") require intermediaries receiving, storing, transmitting, or providing any service with respect to electronic messages to not knowingly host, publish, transmit, select or modify any information prohibited under the IT Intermediary Rules and to disable hosting, publishing, transmission, selection or modification of such information once they become aware of it. The IT Intermediary Rules specify the due diligence to be observed by intermediaries and further require the intermediaries to provide a grievance redressal mechanism and also appoint a nodal officer and a resident grievance officer.
