specifications. Our business model emphasizes recurring supply to industrial clients rather than direct sales to retail consumers.

Our product range includes specialised yarns such as para-aramid yarn (high strength and heat resistance), meta-aramid yarn (flame retardancy), modacrylic-blended yarns (thermal stability and flame resistance), peroxidised PAN yarn (heat insulation), antistatic polypropylene yarn (to reduce static build-up in sensitive environments), FR Viscose blends (protective fabrics) and DREF-spun yarns with glass filament cores or aramid sheaths (industrial and protective uses). These products are manufactured either as part of our own product range or on a job work basis, depending on client requirements.
