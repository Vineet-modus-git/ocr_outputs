In the FY 2025, technical textile goods worth ₹ 16,710 Lakhs were exported to the United States. This strong demand stems from the United States' well-established industries such as automotive, construction and filtration, all of which heavily utilize technical textiles. Indian exporters have benefitted from the U.S. market's preference for competitively priced, high-performance materials, coupled with India's ability to meet stringent quality standards and delivery timelines.

A 15% rate was used as a reference for countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit; and for those with which the U.S. has a trade surplus had a comparatively lesser rate of 10%. However, there were some countries that are subject to higher U.S. tariffs.\n* By August 7, 2025, the U.S. had announced increased tariffs of 15-50% on Asian economies, with most rates around 20%. Although these tariffs were lower than the levels announced in April, the rates were much greater than those applied to most Western counterparts, impacting exporters such as Taiwan Region (20%) and India (25%). It was believed to reach a maximum of 50% at the end of August by the U.S Government.\n* Moreover, on July 28, 2025 the U.S imposed a 15% tariff on most EU imports under a new trade agreement, impacting Nordic countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden. Key exemptions include aircraft parts and semiconductor equipment, while steel and aluminum continue to face 50% tariffs.\n* On August 27, 2025 the U.S. President Donald Trump announced the 50% tariff on most of the Indian Goods imported. India has joined other countries such as Brazil who were already facing higher tariffs. This has been expected to be a temporary imposition and economists believe the tariffs could further be brought down. However, the current effect of the tariffs is seen in the engineered goods, automobile sector and textile sector as well. The textile sector which are facing order cancellations has been supported by the Indian Government's extension of duty-free import of cotton until December 31, 2025. The textile industry bodies such as Confederation of Indian Textile Industry are facing 20-25% reduction in exports to U.S in the next six months.
