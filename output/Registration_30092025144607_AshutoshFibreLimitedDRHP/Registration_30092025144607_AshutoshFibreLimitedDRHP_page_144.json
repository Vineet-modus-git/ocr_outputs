According to the Ministry of Textiles and Invest India, specialty fibres account for approximately 30% of the technical textile segment; however, domestic manufacturing capabilities in this category remain limited. This dependence increases the industry's exposure to foreign exchange volatility, elevated landed costs and supply chain disruptions, especially during periods of global uncertainty. Recognizing this structural gap, the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) is actively promoting indigenous production and investment in specialty fibre manufacturing under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative.\n* **Low Awareness & Limited End-User Adoption:** Despite formal promotion via the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM), the penetration of technical textiles in India remains low at just 5-10% compared to 30-70% in advanced economies, as reported in the Ministry of Textiles' India Vision 2047 roadmap. The NTTM's \"Promotion & Market Development\" initiative underscores that awareness among MSMEs, government agencies and institutional buyers about the superior lifecycle performance, cost-efficiency and sector-specific benefits of technical textile yarns remains limited. Consequently, adoption rates in critical sectors such as infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture and defence remain suboptimal. To address this gap, NTTM has mandated technical textile usage across 92 application areas and issued 68 notifications under central ministries to boost institutional uptake. However, without broader awareness-building campaigns, training and end-user engagement, technical textile yarn producers continue to face significant demand-side constraints limiting their ability to scale and capitalize on India's growing technical textiles ambition.\n* **Skill & Workforce Shortage:** India's technical textiles sector faces a critical **shortage of specialized talent**, particularly in niche areas such as **nonwoven technology**, **high-performance fibers and functional finishing techniques**. Most existing textile training programs in the country are geared towards conventional fabric and apparel production, creating a **skill mismatch** as the industry shifts toward high-performance and application-based textile manufacturing. While over **3.48 lakh individuals were trained under the Samarth Scheme** by 2023, the majority of these were trained for traditional roles rather than in technical textile domains.\n\nTo address this gap, the **National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM)** has partnered with institutions such as **NITRA**, **SASMIRA** and **IITs** to develop domain-specific curricula and promote industry-oriented skill development (Source: PIB). However, **implementation has been slow** and many training institutions remain **unaware or under-equipped** to deliver such specialized programs. As a result, the **availability of skilled manpower remains a bottleneck**, limiting the sector's ability to scale and meet growing domestic and export demands for high-value technical textile products.\n* **Insufficient R&D & Innovation Infrastructure:** India's technical textiles sector still faces a significant hurdle in R&D and innovation infrastructure particularly in high-value verticals like Mobiltech, Meditech and Geotech due to limited private-sector investment and underdeveloped research ecosystems. To address this, the Ministry of Textiles approved 20 mission-mode R&D projects worth ₹61090 lakhs in June 2023, covering key areas such as Geotech, Protech, Indutech, Sportech, Build tech and specialty fibres like carbon fibre and UHMWPE, under the 6th Mission Steering Group (MSG) meeting of NTTM. This was followed by the approval of **18 additional projects worth ₹46740 lakhs** in September 2023, spanning domains such as Smart & E-Textiles, Meditech, Sustainable Textiles and Geotextiles, under the 7th MSG meeting. Despite these significant government funding efforts, the industry-academia interface remains weak and overall funding levels are still insufficient to consistently develop cutting-edge yarn technologies highlighting the need for deeper private-sector engagement and enhanced collaboration to drive the next wave of technical textile innovation."}]
