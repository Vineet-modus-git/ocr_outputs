Among these, the use of technical textiles as filtration media has emerged as a critical segment offering solutions for air and liquid filtration in industries, automotive systems, construction, oil & gas operations and medical environments. This surge is supported by regulatory frameworks, environmental compliance norms, increased infrastructure development and heightened focus on hygiene and safety. As India pushes for greater self-reliance in technical textiles under initiatives like the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) and PLI Scheme, the demand for specialized filtration textiles is expanding steadily, positioning the country as a fast-growing market in this domain."}, {"bbox": [108, 434, 1541, 531], "category": "Text", "text": "This rising demand is evident across multiple key sectors, including industrial, automotive, construction, defence and oil & gas, as well as healthcare.

Technical textiles are usually used as a filtration media to separate a solid-gas mixture or a solid-liquid mixture used in a process. These media are majorly made from fibreglass, polyester and nylon. These filters are used in harsher situations thus they are designed specifically to withstand strong, chemical or various conditions."}, {"bbox": [108, 722, 1541, 821], "category": "Text", "text": "Filtration processes in industries are mechanical filtration (filtering larger physical particles), Interception (Filtering particles from a liquid flow) Inertial Deposition (particles which have higher inertia while moving through stream are filtered), Diffusion and Electrostatic Deposition (charged particles are filtered)."}, {"bbox": [108, 849, 1541, 917], "category": "Text", "text": "The fibres specific to the chemical (solid or gaseous), water or any liquid filtration processes are woven fabrics and meshes (filtering from liquid streams), Nonwoven fabrics (gaseous filtration) polymer membranes and nanofiber composites."}, {"bbox": [108, 946, 1541, 1078], "category": "Text", "text": "Like the purposes and the processes mentioned above the technical textile made fibres are used in defence sector.

The National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) has underscored that India's technical textile market is growing at 8-10% annually, driven by industrial demand for non-woven filter fabrics (needle-punched, melt-blown) to meet CPCB and NCAP pollution norms. These nonwovens offer superior properties such as high porosity, fine particle retention, thermal resistance and chemical inertness making them essential for demanding industrial environments. Industries are also shifting from conventional filtration materials to engineered technical textile-based solutions that offer greater efficiency, lower maintenance and compliance with stricter environmental standards. Furthermore, government initiatives to indigenize manufacturing under schemes like Atmanirbhar Bharat and the mandatory use of certified pollution control equipment have boosted the adoption of advanced filter fabrics. This has resulted in a significant rise in orders for specialized filtration yarns, underpinning a multi-billion-dollar segment with continued CAGR growth and rising domestic production capabilities."}, {"bbox": [108, 1457, 1541, 1684], "category": "Text", "text": "**Automotive Components / Automotive Sector:** Technical textiles play a crucial role in India's automotive industry, used in airbags, tyre cords, seat upholstery, carpets, insulation, acoustic lining and filtration media. The global Mobiltech sector was valued at USD 46.2 billion in 2022 and is estimated to grow to USD 57.9 billion by 2027, as reported in the Ministry of Textiles' India Vision 2047 roadmap. Under the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM), over 600 BIS standards and 68 Quality Control Orders have been introduced to ensure quality in automotive-grade fibres and fabrics, strengthening domestic supply chains.
