<table><thead><tr><td>PROCESS</td><td>MACHINES USED</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scanner Machine to evaluate the strength and reliability of yarn splices created during the winding stage. In yarn manufacturing, joining yarn ends is an essential step, typically performed by pneumatic, mechanical, or electrostatic splicers. The test ensures that the splices have sufficient strength to withstand subsequent weaving or knitting operations, thereby preventing breakages and preserving the integrity, appearance and performance of the final fabric.</td><td><img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Mesdan Evenness Tester"><br>Mesdan Evenness Tester<br><br><img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Classimat Machine"><br>Classimat Machine<br><br><img src="image_placeholder.png" alt="Splice Scanner"><br>Splice Scanner</td></tr></tbody></table>
