In addition to the IPO Proceeds and our internally generated cash flow, we may need other sources of financing to meet our capital needs which may include entering into new debt facilities with lending institutions or raising additional equity in the capital markets. We may need to raise additional capital from time to time, dependent on business conditions. The factors that would require us to raise additional capital could be business growth beyond what the current balance sheet can sustain; additional capital requirements imposed due to changes in regulatory regime or significant depletion in our existing capital base due to unusual operating losses. Any fresh issue of shares or convertible securities would dilute existing holders and such issuance may not be done at terms and conditions, which are favorable to the then existing shareholders of our Company. If our Company decides to raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt, our interest obligations will increase and we may be subject to additional covenants, which could further limit our ability to access cash flows from our operations. Such financings could cause our debt-to-equity ratio to increase or require us to create charges or liens on our assets in favour of lenders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure adequate financing in the future on acceptable terms, in time, or at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient financing could result in the delay or abandonment of our expansion plans. Our business and future results of operations may be affected if we are unable to implement our expansion strategy."}, {"bbox": [62, 974, 1539, 1041], "category": "List-item", "text": "**57.

An increase in product losses due to such factors at our existing and future retail stores or our retail channels may require us to install additional security and surveillance equipment and incur additional expenses towards inventory management and handling. While we have internal control which regulate employee code of conduct, however we have not adopted any formal code of conduct for the same and we cannot assure you that our current internal control measures will successfully prevent such losses. Further, there are inherent risks in cash management as part of our operations, which include theft and robbery, employee fraud and the risks involved in transferring cash from our retail stores to banks. Additionally, in case of losses due to theft, financial misappropriation, fire, breakage or damage caused by other casualties, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover from our insurers the full amount of any such loss in a timely manner, or at all. There have been no such cases that our Company has experienced in past. But such losses are unpredictable and mitigation of such risks can only be done for which we have installed proper security measures, but at any point of time if such incidents occurred, it may impact results, operations and finance of our business."}, {"bbox": [62, 1838, 1307, 1872], "category": "List-item", "text": "**59.
