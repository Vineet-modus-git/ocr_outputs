Para-aramid yarn (high strength and heat resistance) – It is a synthetic fibre made with polymers in a two-step process where the resulting para-aramid polymer is followed by spinning. Generally used in protective clothing for defence sector, aerospace composite material and some automotive parts.\n2. Meta-aramid yarn – This specific yarn is made through polymerizing diamines and chlorides into a heavier polymer. This is transformed to viscous liquid called dope by mixing the heavy polymer into a solvent. Thus, the dope is spun into filaments which are later packed as a yarn. The meta-aramid yarn is used in applications with use of high temperature. The fibre yarn has good heat and flame resistance thus used in clothing for firefighters and armed forces and industrial processes dealing with high voltage of electricity and temperatures such as furnaces.\n3. Modacrylic-blended yarns – as the name suggest the yarn is made by blending modacrylic fibres and other fibres such as cotton, wool or aramid. Blending other fibres results in improving features such as flame retardancy. The end uses of these yarns are in Airline blankets, home textile products such as blankets, carpets and Innerwear garments.\n4. Peroxidised PAN yarn -Peroxidised Polyacrylonitrile yarn is also known as Preox-yarn or Oxi-pan finds it use in Industries where welding blankets, protective clothing such as firefighting suits, gloves, welding apparel are used. Automotive components and aerospace sector furnishings such as seats and cushion.\n5. Antistatic Polypropylene Yarn – Conductive materials added to polypropylene (PP) while expulsing to dissipate static electricity resulting in the antistatic PP yarn. The resultant yarn brings features such as lightweight structure, resistance to moisture, chemicals. It is majorly used in industrial filtration application, carpets and packaging material for electronics.\n6. FR Viscose blends – The yarn consists of fibres made from viscose (regenerated cellulose fibres chemically treated and blended with other fibres such as cotton or wool and before the process of blending, the viscose fibre is mixed with flame retardant. Other than the functional feature of fire resistance by manufacturing, it helps retain moisture, a soft and luxurious feel. It is thus used in industrial applicants to tolerate high heat and flames and in clothing ranging from protective to activewear.\n7. DREF-spun yarns also known as Dr Ernst Fehrer spun yarn based on the inventor if the fraction spinning method. This method results in coarse yarns which have features like better dust holding capacity for effective filtration. It offers other benefits such as high bulk and low strength, better air permeability."}, {"bbox": [107, 1202, 1543, 1428], "category": "Text", "text": "The Ministry of Textiles has reiterated its strategic focus on the development of India's technical textile sector.
