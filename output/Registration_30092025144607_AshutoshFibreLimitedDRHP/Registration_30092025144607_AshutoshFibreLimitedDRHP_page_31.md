# SECTION III – RISK FACTORS

An investment in our Equity Shares involves a high degree of financial risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider all the information in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus, particularly the “Financial Information” and the related notes, “Our Business” and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations” on page 228, 145 and 235 respectively of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus and the risks and uncertainties described below, before making a decision to invest in our Equity Shares.

The risk factors set forth below are not exhaustive and do not purport to be complete or comprehensive in terms of all the risk factors that may arise in connection with our business or any decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Equity Shares. This section addresses general risks associated with the industry in which we operate and specific risks associated with our Company. Any of the following risks, individually or together, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, which could result in a decline in the value of our Equity Shares and the loss of all or part of your investment in our Equity Shares. While we have described the risks and uncertainties that our management believes are material, these risks and uncertainties may not be the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those we currently are not aware of or deem immaterial, may also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

This Draft Red Herring Prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the considerations described below and elsewhere in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

The financial and other related implications of risks concerned, wherever quantifiable, have been disclosed in the risk factors below. However, there are risk factors the potential effects of which are not quantifiable and therefore no quantification has been provided with respect to such risk factors. In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of our Company and the terms of the Issue, including the merits and the risks involved. You should not invest in this Issue unless you are prepared to accept the risk of losing all or part of your investment and you should consult your tax, financial and legal advisors about the particular consequences to you of an investment in our Equity Shares.

Unless otherwise indicated, industry and market data used in this section has been derived from the report entitled “Industry Report on Indian Technical Textile Yarns”, dated September 18, 2025 (the “Industry Report”), prepared and released by Dun & Bradstreet (“D&B”), which has been commissioned and paid for by our Company exclusively in connection with this Issue and for the purposes of confirming our understanding of the industry in which we operate. The Industry report has been prepared pursuant to an engagement letter dated entered into between our Company and D&B. A copy of the Industry Report is available for inspection on the website of our Company at https://www.ashutoshfibre.com/investor.html from the date of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus until the Bid/Issue Closing Date. The data included herein contains excerpts from the Industry Report, which may have been re-ordered or reformatted by us for presentation purposes.

## Materiality

The Risk factors have been determined on the basis of their materiality. The following factors have been considered for determining the materiality.

1. Some events may have material impact quantitatively;

2. Some events may have material impact qualitatively instead of quantitatively.

3. Some events may not be material individually but may be found material collectively.

4. Some events may not be material at present but may be having material impact in future.

## Note:

The risk factors as envisaged by the management along with the proposals to address the risk if any. Unless specified or quantified in the relevant risk factors below, we are not in a position to quantify the financial implication of any of the risks described in this section.

In this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, any discrepancies in any table between total and the sums of the amount listed are due to rounding off. Any percentage amounts, as set forth in “Risk Factors” on page 27 and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations” on page 235 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus unless otherwise indicated, has been calculated on the basis of the amount disclosed in the “Restated Financial Statements” on page 228.

Unless otherwise stated, references in this section to the “Company” or “our Company” means “Ashutosh Fibre Limited” and “we”, “our” or “us” (including in the context of any financial information) is a reference to our Company.
