These yarns are resistant to chemicals, UV radiation and abrasion and are designed to provide consistent performance in industrial and protective textile applications.<br>The primary end-use applications of our modacrylic yarns include:<ul><li><strong>Oil and Gas industry:</strong> protective apparel used in high-risk environments.</li><li><strong>Electrical utilities:</strong> flame-retardant fabrics and equipment covers.</li><li><strong>Firefighting, military and defence:</strong> protective clothing and gear.</li><li><strong>Transportation and industrial workwear:</strong> uniforms and safety textiles for industries with elevated fire and chemical exposure risks.</li></ul></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Poly Poly Corespun Yarn</td><td>Poly poly corespun yarn is manufactured by combining a continuous filament polyester core with an outer covering of polyester staple fibres. This structure provides higher tensile strength, abrasion resistance and seam performance compared to conventional spun yarns, while also ensuring processability across diverse textile applications.<br>With increasing demand in India as an import substitute for similar products from China, this yarn allows our Company to cater to domestic buyers with locally manufactured material that provides improved cost efficiency and margins.<br>The primary applications of poly poly corespun yarn include the manufacture of:<ul><li>Sewing threads for denim and workwear</li><li>Uniforms and leather goods</li><li>Other heavy-duty textiles requiring strength and seam reliability</li></ul></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [1088, 146, 1384, 543], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1049, 539, 1427, 1042], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1025, 1346, 1451, 1829], "category": "Picture"}]
