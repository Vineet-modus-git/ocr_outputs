Upon arrival at our facility, the raw materials are subjected to an initial cleaning process to remove dust, impurities, or any external contaminants that may affect further processing.</p><p>Following cleaning, the raw material undergoes a quality control check using the Baer Sorter manual machine, which is employed to determine the length of the fibres. While synthetic fibres are generally manufactured to standardised lengths, variations may occur due to handling or supplier differences. Fibre length uniformity is a critical quality parameter, as it directly influences spinnability, yarn strength and overall process stability. Inconsistent fibre lengths can cause issues such as uneven yarn formation, increased breakages and inefficiencies during spinning.</p><p>By conducting this preliminary quality check at the raw material stage, we ensure that only fibre batches meeting our specifications are admitted into the spinning line. This step not only supports process reliability and product consistency, but also reduces the risk of wastage and downstream defects, thereby optimising overall production efficiency.</p></td><td><img src=\"baer_sorter_manual_machine.png\" alt=\"Baer Sorter Manual Machine\"><br>Baer Sorter Manual Machine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mixing and Blowroom:</strong><p>Once the raw material quality is checked and approved, the fibre lots are weighed and mixed in the required proportions to achieve the desired properties of the final yarn. This blending process ensures that the physical and mechanical characteristics of the yarn—such as tensile strength, uniformity and elongation—are consistent with end-use specifications.</p><p>The blowroom is the first major stage of the spinning operation, where the mixed fibres undergo a sequence of mechanical treatments. The key functions of this stage include:<ul><li><strong>Opening</strong>: Fibres are opened into smaller tufts to facilitate downstream processing.</li><li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Impurities, micro dust and foreign particles are removed.</li><li><strong>Blending</strong>: Different raw materials are homogenised to achieve uniform fibre distribution.</li><li><strong>Even Feeding</strong>: Material is fed evenly to the carding machine, minimising variation and delivering consistent & even weighted feed of opened and cleaned material to the carding machine minimising variations.</li></ul></p><p>The blowroom process is designed to achieve these objectives while minimising fibre damage. Care is taken to avoid excessive fibre rupture, neps (entangled fibre knots) and loss of good fibres, while also removing broken seed particles and contaminants. This balance is critical in ensuring both product quality and raw material efficiency.</p><p><strong>Quality Testing</strong>: Following the blowroom process, quality checks involve visually assessing the opening efficiency to ensure there are no excessive large clumps of fibre. It is also important to analyse waste collected from blowroom to determine the percentage of impurities removed and to ensure minimal fiber loss. Fibre is also collected from different stages of blowroom particularly after beaters to check for fibre breakage/damage, if any. This testing provides early detection of deviations, allowing for corrective measures before fibres proceed further into subsequent processes into spinning.</p></td><td><img src=\"blowroom.png\" alt=\"Blowroom\"></td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [1092, 231, 1444, 548], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1012, 588, 1368, 619], "category": "Caption", "text": ""}, {"bbox": [1012, 946, 1482, 1308], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1012, 1336, 1468, 1748], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1204, 1751, 1331, 1779], "category": "Caption", "text": "Blowroom"}]
