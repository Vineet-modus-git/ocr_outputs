Since, the entire requirement is to be funded from the proceeds of the Issue, there is no requirement to make firm arrangements of finance under Regulation 230(1)(e) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations through verifiable means towards at least 75% of the stated means of finance, excluding the amounts to be raised through the proposed Issue.

Subject to applicable law, if the actual utilization towards the Objects is lower than the proposed deployment, such balance will be used for general corporate purposes to the extent that the total amount to be utilized towards general corporate purposes will not exceed 15% of the Gross Proceeds or ₹1,000 lakhs, whichever is lower, in accordance with Regulation 230(2) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations. In case of a shortfall in raising the requisite capital from the Net Proceeds or an increase in the total estimated cost of the Objects, business considerations may require us to explore a range of options including utilizing internal accruals and seeking additional debt from existing and/or future lenders. We believe that such alternate arrangements would be available to fund any such shortfalls.
