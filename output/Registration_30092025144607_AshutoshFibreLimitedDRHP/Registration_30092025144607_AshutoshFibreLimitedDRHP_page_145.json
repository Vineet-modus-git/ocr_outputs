A large portion of domestic manufacturers continue to rely on conventional spinning and processing equipment, which are not suitable for the complex requirements of technical textile applications. This technological gap restricts domestic innovation, compromises product quality and inhibits the ability to meet international performance standards. The lack of modern infrastructure, coupled with high capital investment requirements and limited local manufacturing of such machinery, has led to low technology penetration in this segment. This constraint not only hampers productivity and scalability but also reduces the industry's ability to transition toward value-added and export-ready technical yarns affecting India's long-term competitiveness in global markets."}, {"bbox": [109, 1506, 1546, 1703], "category": "List-item", "text": "➤ **Inadequate Integration with Global Value Chains (GVCs):** India's technical textile sector faces significant limitations in its **integration with global value chains**, which restricts its ability to scale exports, attract FDI and access advanced technologies.
