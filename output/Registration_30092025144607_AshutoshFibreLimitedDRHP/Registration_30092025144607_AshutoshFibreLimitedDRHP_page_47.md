Management System), ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health & Safety Management System), Oeko-Tax Standard 100 Certification for Textile Safety and 5S workplace certification, which demonstrate compliance with quality and sustainability practices. However, certain customers, particularly in sectors such as healthcare, defence and protective equipment, may require additional international certifications. Failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could restrict our ability to cater to regulated industries, limit access to export markets, and adversely affect our competitiveness.

Accidents at our facility, including fire, mechanical breakdowns, or chemical hazards, may result in injury or loss of life of employees, damage to property and equipment and suspension of operations. Any such events could expose us to litigation, third-party claims and significant financial liabilities, in addition to reputational harm and adverse publicity.

Although, as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has not faced any significant non-compliance, litigation, or penalties in relation to safety, health, environmental, or labour matters, there can be no assurance that such instances will not arise in the future. Any future non-compliance, adverse orders, or reputational damage in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our Company's operations, cash flows and financial condition.

**30. Our ability to recruit and retain key management personnel, employees with technical knowledge and plant operating staff is critical to the success and stability of our business. Any inability to attract or retain such individuals could materially and adversely affect our operations, strategy and financial performance.**

Our Company's performance is closely linked to the expertise and continuity of its key managerial staff, senior executives, employees with specialized technical knowledge and skilled plant operators. Technical yarn manufacturing requires advanced know-how in handling processes such as ring spinning, DREF friction spinning, open-end spinning and fibre blending (including para-aramid, FR viscose and modacrylic). Plant operators with experience in managing these processes and operating specialized machinery are essential for ensuring product quality, minimizing downtime and optimizing production efficiency.

Given the competitive nature of the textile and technical yarn industry, demand for qualified managerial, technical and operational staff is high. Competitors and companies in related industries may offer more attractive remuneration packages, career prospects, or working conditions, which could make it difficult for us to retain or recruit such personnel. If we are unable to offer competitive compensation or career advancement opportunities, we risk losing such employees, which may disrupt our business continuity.

The departure of senior management could also create a leadership vacuum, leading to loss of institutional knowledge, lower employee morale and delays in strategic decision-making. Similarly, the loss of experienced plant operators or technical staff may result in operational inefficiencies, longer training cycles for replacements and possible delays in fulfilling customer orders. Recruiting new personnel with equivalent expertise is often difficult and even when possible, it involves significant time and cost in training before they can match the productivity and skillset of existing staff.

Certain technical roles may also require specific qualifications, certifications, or compliance with statutory and industry standards. If our current employees fail to maintain these qualifications, or if we are unable to recruit individuals who meet the regulatory or industry requirements, our operations may be disrupted. Such non-compliance may also expose us to regulatory scrutiny or penalties.

While we endeavour to mitigate these risks by providing training, career development opportunities and a safe workplace environment, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key managerial, technical and operational employees in the future. Any inability to do so may adversely affect our business operations, customer relationships, strategic growth and overall financial condition.

**31. Any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds as disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus shall be subject to certain compliance requirements, including prior Shareholders' approval.**

The funding requirements and the deployment (including the schedule of deployment) of the Net Proceeds are based on the current business plan and strategy of our Company. Our Company may have to revise these from time to time as a result of variations including changes in estimates and other external factors, which may not be within the control of the management of our Company. This may entail rescheduling, revising or cancelling the planned expenditure and fund requirement and increasing or decreasing the deployment for a particular purpose from its planned expenditure or changing the schedule of deployment of the Net Proceeds at the discretion of the Board of Directors of our Company, in compliance with applicable law. In accordance with Section 27 of the Companies Act, 2013, we cannot undertake any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds or the schedule of deployment of the Net Proceeds as disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus without obtaining the shareholders' approval through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that requires us to undertake variation in the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the Shareholders' approval in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or inability in obtaining such Shareholders' approval may adversely affect our business or operations.

Further, our Promoters or controlling shareholders would be required to provide an exit opportunity to the shareholders who do
