Global macroeconomic overview

Global GDP is estimated to grow at 2.8% in Calendar Year 2025 and 3.0% in Calendar Year 2026

As per the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) April 2025 update, global gross domestic product (GDP) growth witnessed a growth of 3.3% in 2024 as signs of stabilization emerged- inflation came down from multidecade highs, followed a gradual as well as labour markets normalized, with unemployment and vacancy rates returning to pre pandemic levels.

However, major policy shifts are resetting the global trade system and giving rise to uncertainty in the global economy. Since February 2025, a series of new tariff measures by the United States and countermeasures by its trading partners have been announced and implemented, ending up in near-universal US tariffs on April 2 and bringing effective tariff rates to levels not seen in a century. This, on its own is a major negative shock to growth and the unpredictability with which these measures have been unfolding also has a negative impact on economic activity and the outlook.

This swift escalation of trade tensions and extremely high levels of policy uncertainty are expected to have a significant impact on global economic activity. Under the reference forecast that incorporates information as of April 4, global growth is projected to drop to 2.8% in Calendar Year 2025 and 3.0% in Calendar Year 2026. Over the medium term (Calendar Year 2026 to Calendar Year 2030), global GDP is expected to expand at CAGR approximately 3.2%.

The adoption of technology, the rapid rise of digital infrastructure, and shifting demographic trends are set to profoundly reshape the global economy in the coming decades. As cloud computing, artificial intelligence, automation, and data-driven business models permeate every sector, productivity and innovation are accelerating, driving new sources of economic output. At the same time, the world faces contrasting demographic dynamics: developed economies are grappling with aging populations that will strain healthcare systems and reduce workforce participation, while emerging markets benefit from younger demographics that can support sustained growth. This youthful workforce, combined with technology-led advances in areas like financial inclusion, healthcare delivery, and education, is expected to narrow development gaps and boost the global contribution of emerging economies. The surge in digital infrastructure - from data centres and smart grids to electric vehicle charging networks - is also transforming energy demand. Together, these forces will redefine competitive advantages across regions, as countries that embrace innovation and build digital capabilities are positioned to drive a disproportionate share of global GDP growth over the next several decades.
