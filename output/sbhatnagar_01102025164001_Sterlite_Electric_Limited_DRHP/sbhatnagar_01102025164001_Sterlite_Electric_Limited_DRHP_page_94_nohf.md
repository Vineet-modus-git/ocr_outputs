accordance with Ind AS, Indian GAAP, IFRS or US GAAP. In addition, these non GAAP measures are not standardised terms,
hence a direct comparison of these Non-GAAP Measures between companies may not be possible. Other companies may
calculate these Non-GAAP Measures differently from us, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. These non-GAAP
financial measures and such other industry related statistical and other information relating to our operations and financial
performance may not be computed on the basis of any standard methodology that is applicable across the industry and therefore
may not be comparable to financial measures and industry related statistical information of similar nomenclature that may be
computed and presented by other companies. For further information, see "Other Financial Information – Non-GAAP Financial
Measures" on page 423.

The determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions and will be determined by our Company in consultation with the BRLMs. The relevant financial parameters based on which the Price Band will be determined shall be disclosed in the advertisement that will be issued for the publication of the Price Band. Further, the Offer Price of the Equity Shares is proposed to be determined on the basis of assessment of market demand for the Equity Shares offered through the book-building process prescribed under the SEBI ICDR Regulations, and certain quantitative and qualitative factors as set out in the section “Basis for the Offer Price” on page 128 and the Offer Price, multiples and ratios may not be indicative of the market price of our Company on listing or thereafter.

Prior to the Offer, there has been no public market for our Equity Shares, and an active trading market on the Stock Exchanges
may not develop or be sustained after the Offer. Listing does not guarantee that a market for the Equity Shares will develop, or
if developed, the liquidity of such market for the Equity Shares.

The market price of the Equity Shares may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations
in our operating results, market conditions specific to the industry we operate in, developments relating to India, announcements
by third parties or governmental entities of significant claims or proceedings against us, volatility in the securities markets in
India and other jurisdictions, variations in the growth rate of financial indicators, variations in revenue or earnings estimates by
research publications, and changes in economic, legal and other regulatory factors. As a result, we cannot assure you that an
active market will develop or sustained trading will take place in the Equity Shares or provide any assurance regarding the price
at which the Equity Shares will be traded after listing. Further, the market price of the Equity Shares may decline below the
Offer Price. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Equity Shares at or above the Offer Price.

59. Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties, including adverse application of tax laws, may adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We are subject to laws and government regulations, including in relation to safety, health, environmental protection and labour. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be adversely affected by unfavourable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and our business. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects may be adversely impacted, to the extent that we are unable to suitably respond to and comply with any such changes in applicable law and policy. The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate are evolving and are subject to change. The Government of India may implement new laws or other regulations and policies that could affect our business in general, which could lead to new compliance requirements, including requiring us to obtain approvals and licenses from the Government and other regulatory bodies, or impose onerous requirements.

For instance, the Government of India has announced the union budget for the Financial Year 2026 (the “Budget”), pursuant to which the Finance Act, 2025 has amended the Income-tax Act, 1961, including the capital gains tax rates with effect from the date of announcement of the Budget. We have not fully determined the effects of these recent and proposed laws and regulations on our business.
