Electrification, EVs and renewables have surged. This pressure is pushing grid-modernisation endeavors in India. Digital-twin planning is major technological application in this regard. It enables the power sector to mirror transmission and distribution lines in a virtual model that tests renewable injections, right-of-way limits and cyber threats before projects break ground."}, {"bbox": [191, 344, 1461, 666], "category": "Text", "text": "URTDSM (Unified Real Time Dynamic State Measurement) project is another. Under the URTDSM (Unified Real Time Dynamic State Measurement) project, bids were invited by PGCIL for installing 1184 Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) at 351 substations and 34 control centers across India in 2014. In 2018, General Electric announced it had commissioned the 1st phase of the world's largest Wide Area Monitoring System for PGCIL for the Northern Grid in India. The project is part of the around USD 52.2 million contract awarded to GE T&D in January 2014 to install WAMS across all five regional grids of north, south, east, west and north-east. WAMS is an advanced measurement system that uses phasor measurement units (PMUs) to measure the dynamic state of the grid and detect the onset of any fluctuation across the grid. Through visualization displays, it supports the speedy detection of any fluctuation across the grid and provides real time data for advanced analytical applications resulting in better grid management."}, {"bbox": [191, 684, 1459, 817], "category": "Text", "text": "Other key area of focus is the digitization of substations, which aims to reduce carbon footprint through the implementation of digital substations, process bus-based technologies, and the use of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs).

The scheme requires state governments to clear pending payments, install smart meters, and pay subsidies upfront. Additionally, the government has provided incentives for states to reduce AT&C losses and ACS-ARR gaps. As a result, T&D losses have been declining and are expected to continue decreasing, leading to a reduction in power demand by 8 to 9 billion units (BUs) on average every year between fiscal 2026 to 2030.
