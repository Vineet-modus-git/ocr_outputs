The Group has not classified any hedge as Fair Value hedge or hedge of net investment in foreign operation.

Cash flow hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described below:

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs or the foreign currency firm commitment is met.

## v) Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity holders of parent Company (after deducting preference dividends and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.

Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they are entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the reporting period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders of the parent Company and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

## w) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Core Management Committee which includes the Board of Directors which is the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') and considering the economic characteristics of the Group's operations.
