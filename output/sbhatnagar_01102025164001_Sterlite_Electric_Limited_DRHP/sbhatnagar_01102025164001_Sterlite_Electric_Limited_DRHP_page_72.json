There can be no assurance that we or our component suppliers comply or can continue to comply with all regulatory requirements or the quality requirement standards of our customers. Because of the longer useful life of some our products, it is possible that latent defects might not appear for several years. There is no guarantee that any future non-compliance with quality standards will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. The failure by us or any of our suppliers to achieve or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or quality standards may disrupt our ability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, with a component supplier, until a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. The quality of raw materials and the goods we trade in will have an impact on the quality of the finished products and in turn affect our brand image, business and revenue. Our or our component supplier's failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause adverse consequences to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, the refusal of regulatory authorities to grant approvals, delays, suspensions or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, all of which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that if we need to engage new suppliers to satisfy our business requirement, we will be able to locate new suppliers in compliance with regulatory requirements in a timely manner, or at all.
