This growth was largely driven by the expansion of the non-agricultural economy. Notably, the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the financial, state, and professional services sector registered the highest CAGR of 7.4% during this period. In contrast, agriculture, livestock, forestry, and fishing sector grew at a relatively modest CAGR of 4.0% during the same period. Additionally, a key contributor to GDP growth during this period was the rise in the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), which constitutes the largest share of GDP. This was complemented by the improvements in exports and an increase in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Collectively, these three components- PFCE, GFCF, and exports (imports- exports) formed approximately 89% of the overall GDP in Fiscal 2025."}, {"bbox": [190, 472, 1459, 728], "category": "Text", "text": "According to the Second Advance Estimates of Fiscal 2025, India's GDP is projected to grow at 6.5%, a moderation from the 9.2% growth recorded in Fiscal 2024.
