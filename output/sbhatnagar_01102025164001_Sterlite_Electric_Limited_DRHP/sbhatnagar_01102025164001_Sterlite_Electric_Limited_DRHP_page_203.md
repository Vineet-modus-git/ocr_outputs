## Introduction to conductors

Conductors, such as all aluminium conducts (AAC), all alloy aluminium conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductors steel reinforced (ACSR), high ampacity conductors, AL-59 alloy conductors, High Performance Conductors (HPC) and High Temperature Low Sag (HTLS) are used as transmission and distribution lines to deliver bulk power from generating stations to the load centres and large industrial consumers. Bulk power transmission is generally done over bare, overhead conductors at voltage levels of 220 kV and above.

The Transmission system is to deliver bulk power from power stations to the load centres and large industrial consumers beyond the economical service range of the regular primary distribution lines whereas distribution system is to deliver power from power sector or substations to the various consumers.
