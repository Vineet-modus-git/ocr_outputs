(1) *Wire Drawing*: The wire drawing process for power cables involves pulling a 9mm diameter AL/CU rod or wire through a series of wire drawing dies with progressively smaller openings, reducing its diameter and increasing its length while shaping it into a fine electrical wire.

(2) *Stranding*: The stranding process for power cables involves twisting individual small-diameter wires into a composite conductor according to standard to create a conductor. This process improves a cable's mechanical properties, such as flexibility and resistance to breakage, making it suitable for various applications by forming concentric or other specific patterns.

(3) *Tripple Extrusion*: Triple extrusion for a power cable is a process that applies three layers of semicon and insulation simultaneously using a single, specialized crosshead. This technique is used for high-performance cables, such as those for medium and high voltages, and significantly improves insulation quality, durability, and safety by ensuring perfect contact between layers and preventing foreign contaminants from entering.

(4) *Laying Up (For 3-core MV cables)*: The laying-up process for power cables involves mechanically twisting individual cores or pairs of cores together to form a stable, round, and flexible cable structure. This process creates a complete cable by adding filler materials to maintain shape and stability.

(5) *Armoring (For LTDC & MV cables)*: The armouring process for a power cable involves adding a protective metal layer, typically galvanized steel wire or strips, by winding it around the cable's inner layers. This mechanical protection enhances the cable's resistance to crushing, impact, and environmental damage.

(6) *Lead Extrusion (For EHV cables)*: A lead extrusion process for power cable involves forcing molten lead through a die to form a protective, watertight sheath around the conductor and insulation of a power cable. This is a form of extrusion, a manufacturing process where material is pushed through a die to create a fixed cross-sectional profile.

(7) *Aluminium Corrugation (For EHV cables)*: This process is to provide an electric cable with a corrugated sheath of aluminium or aluminium alloy, the sheath being manufactured by surrounding the core of the cable with a tube and subsequently performing a corrugating operation which may be arranged to bring the troughs of the corrugations.

(8) *Outer Sheathing*: The outer sheathing process for a power cable is a manufacturing method where a protective outer layer of material, typically plastic or metal, is applied to the cable as a final covering. This process uses specialized equipment like extruders to melt and shape the sheathing material around the cable followed by a cooling system to solidify it. Protective outer covering that shields the cable from moisture, chemical exposure, fire, and mechanical damage.

(9) *Testing and quality control*: Power cables undergo electrical, mechanical, and dimensional testing as per IS/IEC standards. Tests include high voltage, insulation resistance, conductor resistance, and visual inspection to ensure safety by preventing fires and electrocution, to guarantee reliable performance and avoid costly downtime, and to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations. Testing identifies hidden defects like internal damage or insulation issues, prolongs the cable's lifespan, and ensures the cable's ability to withstand operating conditions.

(10) *Final packing and dispatch*: For final packing and dispatch of power cables, cable ends are sealed to prevent water ingress and moisture damage, then secure the cable to steel drums, ensuring the cable is a single continuous length. Mark and tag the drum clearly with shipping details and handling instructions, then use the appropriate packaging to protect the cable from humidity and abrasion during transit.
