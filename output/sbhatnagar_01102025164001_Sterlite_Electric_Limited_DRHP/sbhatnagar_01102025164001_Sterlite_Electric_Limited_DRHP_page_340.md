ANNEXURE-VI

Notes to the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements
(All amounts in Rupees million unless otherwise stated)

- No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognize new assets or liabilities. The only adjustments are made to harmonize significant accounting policies.

- The financial information in the consolidated financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination has occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination.

The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the financial statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the financial statements of the transferee. The identity of the reserves is preserved, and the reserves of the transferor become the reserves of the transferee.

The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.

b) Investment in associates and joint ventures

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The considerations made in determining whether significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.

The Group's investments in its associate or joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at cost to the Group. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment individually.

The statement of profit and loss reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.

If an entity's share of losses of an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture (which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint ventures), the entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.

Unrealised gains resulting from the transactions between the Group and its associate or joint venture, to the extent of Group's interests in the associate or joint venture, are eliminated in the statement of profit and
