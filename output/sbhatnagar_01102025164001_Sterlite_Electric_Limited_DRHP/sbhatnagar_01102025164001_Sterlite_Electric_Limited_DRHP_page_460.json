The discount rates represent a market rate that considers the risks and premiums specific to the service concession transmission asset. The discount rates are fixed over the concession period and reflects the price that a customer would have paid for the promised goods or services if the customer had paid cash for those goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the customer."}]
