## Customer Contracts

We have fixed-price contracts, with back-to-back arrangements relating to the price of materials. We also purchase forward-contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in pricing of the materials. As a result, we believe that our business is generally hedged against fluctuations in materials, and our margins are generally not affected by changes in the prices of materials.

## Raw Materials

Our primary raw materials and components we use are aluminium for our conductors and aluminium, copper and PVC compounds for cables. The prices of copper and aluminium are linked to the prices on the London Metal Exchange, and the price of PVC Compounds depends largely on the price of crude oil, each of which is generally quoted in US Dollars. Accordingly, the prices we pay for these raw materials can fluctuate due to volatility in the commodity markets or in foreign currency exchange rates. The table below sets forth details of our total cost of materials as a percentage of our total expenses (continuing operations) in the years indicated:
