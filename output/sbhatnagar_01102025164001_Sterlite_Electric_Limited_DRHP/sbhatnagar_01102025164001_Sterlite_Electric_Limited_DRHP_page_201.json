This growth can be attributed to heightened international demand, particularly from organizations such as the International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which have invested heavily in transmission projects.

The 'China+1' strategy has also boosted demand for Indian cables, particularly in the US and Europe, where exports have grown at a 44% CAGR from Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2024.

This decline was caused by a 34% drop in copper cathode imports due to a quality control order (QCO) effective December 2024, which disrupted supply and raised costs. Global demand fluctuations for optical fiber, tied to slower 5G rollouts, and volatile raw material prices (copper and aluminum) further squeezed margins, reducing export competitiveness. The completion of foreign Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) projects also reduced demand for copper wire used in power and infrastructure projects, contributing to the export dip. With copper supply stabilizing and new EPC opportunities emerging in Africa and Southeast Asia, exports are expected to recover in Fiscal 2026."}, {"bbox": [190, 1444, 893, 1481], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Export value of wire and cables (Fiscal2019 to Fiscal 2030)"}, {"bbox": [198, 1508, 1457, 1957], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [190, 1985, 884, 2021], "category": "Text", "text": "*Source: Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Crisil Intelligence*"}, {"bbox": [190, 2039, 881, 2075], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Country wise export value of wire and cables, Fiscal 2025"}]
