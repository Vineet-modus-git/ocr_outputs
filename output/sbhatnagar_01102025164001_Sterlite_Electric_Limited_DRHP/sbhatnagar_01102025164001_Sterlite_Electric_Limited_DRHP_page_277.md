250,000 Equity Shares of ₹2 each held by STL in our Company stood cancelled, extinguished, annulled from the effective date of the STL Demerger Scheme. In accordance with the STL Demerger Scheme, our Company also increased its authorized share capital to facilitate issue of securities under the STL Demerger Scheme. For details, please see the section titled "- *Amendments to the Memorandum of Association in the last 10 years*" on page 250.

The fair value of the power business and equity shares and redeemable preference shares issued by STL pursuant to the STL Demerger Scheme were determined based on the valuation report dated May 18, 2015, issued by registered valuers. In accordance with the STL Demerger Scheme, the equity shareholders of STL were given the option to accept allotment of (i) one fully paid up equity share of face value of ₹2 each of our Company for every five fully paid-up equity share of ₹2 each held in STL; or (ii) one fully paid-up redeemable preference share of face value of ₹2 each of our Company for every five fully paid-up equity share of ₹2 each held in STL. Further, except for our Promoters who are the promoters of STL and Pravin Agarwal who is the Chairman and Non-Executive Director of our Company, none of our Promoters or Directors are related to STL.

Further, pursuant to the STL Demerger Scheme, the Company was required to list 17,900,190 redeemable preference shares of face value of ₹2 each issued by our Company. Our Company received the in-principle approval from NSE for listing of the redeemable preference shares subject to compliance with certain conditions, including seeking a relaxation under applicable provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares) Regulations, 2013 from SEBI. Accordingly, our Company made an application before SEBI for such relaxation which was not acceded to by SEBI due to alleged violations of certain provisions of the Companies Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares) Regulations, 2013 and the SEBI Listing Regulations. Accordingly, for the purposes of protecting the interest of and providing an exit mechanism to the redeemable preference shareholders, our Company varied the terms of the redeemable preference shares for an early redemption at the redemption value set out in the STL Demerger Scheme. Such variation was approved by our Board of Directors by way of their resolution dated November 13, 2017, and the redeemable preference shareholders by way of a resolution dated December 20, 2017. Consequently, our Company withdrew the application for listing of the redeemable preference shares and the redeemable preference shares were redeemed. For details, please see the sections titled "Risk Factors - Our Company has in the past withdrawn its application for listing its redeemable preference shares and any disputes in the future related to this may result in litigation or other adverse consequences" and "Capital Structure" on pages 63 and 97, respectively.
