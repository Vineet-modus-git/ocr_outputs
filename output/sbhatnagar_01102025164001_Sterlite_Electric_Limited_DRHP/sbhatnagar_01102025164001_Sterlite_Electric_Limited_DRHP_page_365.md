ANNEXURE-VI

Notes to the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements
(All amounts in Rupees million unless otherwise stated)

(ii) Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants – Amendments to Ind AS 1

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of Ind AS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:

* What is meant by a right to defer settlement

* That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period

* That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right

* That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification

In addition, a requirement has been introduced to require disclosure when a liability arising from a loan agreement is classified as non-current and the entity's right to defer settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants within twelve months.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2025 and must be applied retrospectively. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on current practice and whether existing loan agreements may require renegotiation.

(iii) Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments to Ind AS 7 and Ind AS 107

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified amendments to Ind AS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and Ind AS 107 Financial Instruments: Disclosures to clarify the characteristics of supplier finance arrangements and require additional disclosure of such arrangements. The disclosure requirements in the amendments are intended to assist users of financial statements in understanding the effects of supplier finance arrangements on an entity's liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk.

The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2025.

The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.

(iv) International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to Ind AS 12

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified amendments to Ind AS 12 Income Taxes in response to the OECD's BEPS Pillar Two rules and include:

* A mandatory temporary exception to the recognition and disclosure of deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar Two model rules; and

* Disclosure requirements for affected entities to help users of the financial statements better understand an entity's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date.

The mandatory temporary exception – the use of which is required to be disclosed – applies immediately. The remaining disclosure requirements apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2025, but not for any interim periods ending on or before 31 March 2026.
