*   *Talent Review:* We conduct a comprehensive assessment for all our mid- to senior-level employees. In addition to reviewing employees' performance, this process seeks to identify key actions for their professional development. Employees' progress on the identified key actions are then tracked regularly.
*   *Leadership Development Framework:* We identify the most crucial roles in our organization, which have the most impact on our overall organisation's vision and plan, and then mapped our talent development efforts against those critical roles.

Further, some of our employees are a part of our Company's Kaushal and Pragati programmes, enabling them to access skill certifications and career-progression pathways. We also train employees in Lean Six Sigma methodologies to streamline operations, reduce waste and drive continuous improvement.
