**Notes:**

(1) Restated Basic earnings per share (in ₹) is calculated by dividing the restated profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Equity Shares outstanding during the year, in accordance with Ind AS 33 'Earnings per Share'.

(2) Restated Diluted earnings per share (in ₹) is calculated by dividing the restated profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Equity Shares outstanding during the year as adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential Equity Shares outstanding during the year, in accordance with Ind AS 33 'Earnings per Share'.

(3) Return on Net Worth (in %) is calculated as restated profit from continuing operations for the year divided by the Net Worth at the end of the respective year.

(4) "Net Worth" means the aggregate value of the paid-up share capital and all reserves created out of the profits and securities premium account and debit or credit balance of profit and loss account, after deducting the aggregate value of the accumulated losses, deferred expenditure and miscellaneous expenditure not written off, but does not include reserves created out of revaluation of assets, write-back of depreciation and amalgamation, in accordance with Regulation 2(1)(hh) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations. We have calculated net worth by aggregate value of equity share capital, instruments entirely equity in nature, securities premium, retained earnings, money received against share warrants, debenture redemption reserve, capital redemption reserve and share based payment reserve.

(5) Net asset value per equity share (in ₹) is computed as net worth, divided by the number of Equity Shares outstanding as at the end of the year.

(6) EBITDA is computed as Restated Profit for the year from continuing operations plus total tax expense (continuing operations), finance costs (continuing operations), depreciation and amortisation expense (continuing operations).

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This section includes certain Non-GAAP financial measures and other statistical information relating to our operations and financial performance (together, "Non-GAAP Measures" and each a "Non-GAAP Measure"), as presented below. These Non-GAAP Measures are not required by or presented in accordance with Ind AS.

Further, these Non-GAAP Measures are not a measurement of our financial performance or liquidity under Ind AS and should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to cash flows, profit/ (loss) for the years or any other measure of financial performance or as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities derived in accordance with Ind AS. In addition, these Non-GAAP Measures are not standardized terms, hence a direct comparison of these Non-GAAP Measures between companies may not be possible. Other companies may calculate these Non-GAAP Measures differently from us, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Although such Non-GAAP Measures are not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards, our Company's management believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating us as they are widely used measures to evaluate a company's operating performance. These non GAAP measures are supplemental measure of our performance and liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, Ind AS, Indian GAAP, IFRS or US GAAP. Further, these Non-GAAP Measures are not a measurement of our financial performance or liquidity under Ind AS, Indian GAAP, IFRS or US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to cash flows, profit/ (loss) for the years or any other measure of financial performance or as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities derived in accordance with Ind AS, Indian GAAP, IFRS or US GAAP.

In addition, these Non-GAAP Measures are not standardised terms, hence a direct comparison of these Non-GAAP Measures between companies may not be possible.

For details, see, "Risk Factors - We have included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain other industry measures related to our operations and financial performance.
