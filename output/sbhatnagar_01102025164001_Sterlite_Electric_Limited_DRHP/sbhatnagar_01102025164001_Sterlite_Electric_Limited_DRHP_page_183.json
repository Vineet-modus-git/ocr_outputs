Investments by the private sector will be largely driven by renewable capacity additions, bulk of which are funded by private generators who develop projects through multiple routes such as government-based tendering, private open access market and captive power segment. The share of the central sector would decrease to approximately 20% in fiscal 2030 from approximately 21% as estimated in fiscal 2026. Apart from a rising share of private, the fall in central sector investments will be due to the increase in state activity in the T&D segment as schemes such as the Revamped Distribution Sector and the plan to integrate 500 GW RE lead to state utilities to invest in InSTS."}, {"bbox": [860, 168, 1457, 618], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [194, 965, 1339, 1001], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## India's data centre installed capacity to cross 2 GW by fiscal 2027, driving strong power demand"}, {"bbox": [194, 1020, 1459, 1213], "category": "Text", "text": "The Indian data centre market has experienced significant growth and transformation in recent years.
