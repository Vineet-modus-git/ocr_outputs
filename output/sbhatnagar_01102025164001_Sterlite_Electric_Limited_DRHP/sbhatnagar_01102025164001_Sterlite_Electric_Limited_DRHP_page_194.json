The growth is primarily driven by the accelerating global transition to renewable energy, which demands smarter, more resilient grid infrastructure and advanced energy storage systems to handle variability in power supply. Rising electrification coupled with increased policy focus on decarbonization and energy security has also spurred higher investment levels, notably emerging regions like India, South Asia and Africa showed gradual yet steady increase in indicating efforts to expand energy access reduce transmission losses and support growing energy demand.
