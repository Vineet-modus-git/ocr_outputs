Management) services. Most of the EPC players provide integrated and customised solutions as per the client requirements through a consultative approach. The overall project works are classified as supply (material) contracts and services contracts. In a comprehensive package, most of the EPC providers offer 3 to 5 years of O&M services after commissioning of the project and after expiry of the services, the developer executes a separate long-term O&M agreement with a dedicated O&M service provider.

## Overview of key client types in Indian power EPC industry

In the Indian Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) industry, clients can be broadly categorized based on their sector and specific requirements. Here are some key client types:

### Public Sector Institutions

These include government bodies and public sector undertakings (PSUs) involved in large-scale infrastructure projects.

*   **Ministries and Government Departments:** Ministry of power, State electricity boards and ministries, Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd, National Load Despatch Center, etc.
*   **Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs):** Organizations like Power Grid Corporation of India, National Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam, Northeast Electric Power Company, etc.

### Private Sector Clients

EPC industry also involves significant participation from private companies across different sectors. In the areas of generation, transmission, and distribution, numerous private companies subcontract specific segments to other EPC companies.

Notably, most inter-state transmission projects are awarded through a tariff-based competitive bidding model, which operates on a build-own-operate basis. As a result, companies that win these projects often subcontract certain components to other EPC companies.

## Key categories of works undertaken in EPC segment

**Mechanical, instrumentation, civil, electrical, operations & maintenance (O&M) and annual maintenance contracts (AMCs) are the key type of EPC works undertaken in the Indian power industry**

Mechanical works / erection works is the most critical component when building a power plant due to its high complexity, necessitating involvement of highly specialised suppliers/contractors of power generation, material handling and instrumentation equipment. In terms of civil works, construction requires high design prowess and construction capability due to installation of specialized equipment. Instrumentation and electrical works are of medium complexity level, with equipment and power plant operations conforming to uniform industry standards. Environmental clearance is a must for all the projects. As per interactions with industry stakeholders, EPC contracting is the preferred route for power plants due to standardized process of power plant construction. EPC players typically subcontract different packages of civil, mechanical, instrumentation and electrical works, with specialized suppliers / vendors being awarded contracts for supply of equipment's such as boilers, turbines and generators (BTG), heaters and cooling systems.

Below is the overview of types of EPC works that are undertaken in the power sector. It majorly includes Erection, Testing and Commissioning (ETC) power plants, with complete boilers, turbines and generators (ETC-BTG) and balance of plant (BOP) works, for various sizes and scale. It also includes integrated construction services to power plants, which include responsibly sourced gas (RSG) reactors, waste heat recovery boilers (WHRB), circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) boilers, steam turbine generators, steam generators including auxiliaries, electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), hydro turbines and BOP packages, including structural steel works, ash handling, coal handling, fuel oil systems, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) & flue gas desulphurization (FGD), high-pressure piping works
