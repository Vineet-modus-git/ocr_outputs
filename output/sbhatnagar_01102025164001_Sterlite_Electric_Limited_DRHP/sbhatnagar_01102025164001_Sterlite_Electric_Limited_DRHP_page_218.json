As of October 2024, India's InSTS line is 277,316 ckm. Central government agencies will issue the tenders for these lines and bidding will be open for government-owned (central and state) and private players. The top 10 states (by InSTS transmission line additions) are expected to account for approximately 81% of the transmission line additions by 2027 under InSTS. Gujarat is expected to lead the way with nearly 16% share in expected additions followed by Uttar Pradesh (15%) and Maharashtra (11%)."}, {"bbox": [193, 1869, 1029, 1902], "category": "Caption", "text": "Outlook for voltage wise substation additions over fiscals 2022 to 2027"}]
