period and reflects the price that a customer would have paid for the promised goods or services if the customer had paid cash for those goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the customer.

The estimates of contract cost and the revenue thereon are reviewed periodically by management and the cumulative effect of any changes in estimates is recognised in the period in which such changes are determined. Where it is probable that total contract expenses will exceed total revenues from a contract, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

### Remuneration of concession assets

Remuneration from service concession arrangement comprise of interest income recognised using the discount rate that reflects the economic volatility on the future cash flows from the service concession infrastructure. The discount rate is represented by a market rate that considers the risks and premiums specific to the service concession transmission asset.

### Revenue from services rendered to joint ventures

Services rendered to joint ventures represent the performance obligation for providing various consultation and agency services in relation to joint venture entities which are satisfied over time.

### Rendering of other services

Revenues from services are recognised over the period of the contract as and when services are rendered. When the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent that the expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered.

*Contract modifications:*

Contract modifications are defined as changes in the scope of the work, other than changes envisaged in the original contract, that may result in a change in the revenue associated with that contract. Modifications to approval before billings can be issued and the amounts relating to the additional work can be collected. The Group does not recognise the revenue from such additional work until the customer's approval has been obtained. In cases where the additional work has been approved but the corresponding change in price has not been determined, the requirement described below for variable consideration is applied: namely, to recognise revenue for an amount with respect to which it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The costs associated with these additional units or services performed are recognised when incurred, irrespective of whether or not the modification has been approved.

*Variable considerations:*

If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

*Contract assets*

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays
