The power cables industry is classified into low voltage, medium voltage, high voltage and extra high voltage cables. These cables are predominantly used in sub-transmission and distribution of power.</td><td>Transmission and distribution of electricity in mainly commercial and industrial settings</td></tr><tr><td>Building Wires</td><td>Building wires are usually made up of copper and aluminium. These are majorly used in residential settings and their carrying capacity/ voltage depends on their end use.</td><td>Commonly used in everyday household items like for connecting household appliances, power outlets, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Communication Cables</td><td>Communication cables are specifically designed to support data transmission across distance at high speed and minimal loss. Examples include, LAN cables, Optic fibre cables, etc.</td><td>Used for transmission of data/ voice/ video signals at high speed without major energy loss.</td></tr><tr><td>Instrumentation cables</td><td>Instrumentation cables are generally used in industrial settings to carry low voltage signals with high accuracy. These cables are properly shielded to ensure no external signal interference and are mainly used to monitor/ control electric systems. The functions of measurement and control are vital in manufacturing and processing applications.</td><td>Few of the applications include industrial equipment control, process controls for e.g. in oil and gas or chemical plants, or mass transit systems which require cables to be heat resistance, resistance due harsh environment and chemicals, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Railway signal cables</td><td>Railway signal cables are specialized cables designed to provide reliable and safe transmission of signal information for railway operations. These cables are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, vibration, and moisture, and are used to control and monitor railway signals, track circuits, and other safety systems.</td><td>Used in railway signaling systems to control and monitor train movements, track circuits, and other safety systems, ensuring safe and efficient railway operations.</td></tr><tr><td>Other special cables</td><td>This class of cables includes cables that are especially designed for a particular end use/ industry due to particular requirements. These types of cables are usually provided as customized solutions against stringent requirements, including temperature, tensile strength, and chemical resistance. For example, Solar cables, which are required to have lifetime reliability of up to 30 years, resistance to extreme temperatures (-40°C to 120°C), ozone, and ultraviolet (UV), halogen free, flame and fire retardancy, etc.</td><td>Multiple specialized applications including sonar detection, mine sweeping and defence purposes across industries like marine, defence, aerospace, etc.</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [193, 1054, 494, 1091], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: Crisil Intelligence"}, {"bbox": [193, 1108, 818, 1145], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Overview of MVCC (medium voltage cable systems)"}, {"bbox": [191, 1163, 1460, 1328], "category": "Text", "text": "Medium Voltage Covered Conductors (MVCCs) are overhead conductors used in distribution circuits with voltages ranging from 1 kV to 33 kV.
