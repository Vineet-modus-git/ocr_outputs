Notes to the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements
(All amounts in Rupees million unless otherwise stated)

## 2.2 Basis of consolidation

The Restated Consolidated Summary Statements comprise the financial statements of the Holding Company, its Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and an Associate as at 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:

* Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee).

* Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and

* The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

* The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee

* Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

* The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights

* The size of the group's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other voting rights holders

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

Restated Consolidated Summary Statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member's financial statements in preparing the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements to ensure conformity with the group's accounting policies.

The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the parent Company, i.e., year ended on 31 March. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.

Consolidation procedure:

(a) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements at the acquisition date.
