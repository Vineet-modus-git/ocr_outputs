(v) Commodity Price Risk

We are affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Our operating activities require the ongoing purchase of
aluminium, copper and lead for manufacture of conductor, OPGW and power cables and therefore requires a continuous supply
of these commodities. Due to the volatility of the price of aluminium, copper and lead, we enter into various purchase contracts
for these commodities on London Metal Exchange. The prices in these purchase contracts are linked to the price on London
Metal Exchange.

Our Board of Directors has developed and enacted a risk management strategy regarding commodity price risk and its mitigation.

Based on forecasted delivery plans, we hedge the aluminium, lead and copper price using future commodity contracts. The forecast is deemed to be highly probable.

Commodity Price Sensitivity

As per our policy for commodity price hedging, all the commodity price exposures as on reporting dates are fully hedged. Thus,
there are no open unhedged exposures on the reporting dates.

Equity Price Risk

We have invested in compulsorily convertible debentures, compulsorily convertible preference share and unlisted equity
securities which are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities.
We manage the equity price risk by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments. Reports on the equity portfolio
are submitted to the our senior management on a regular basis. Our Board of Directors review and approve all equity investment
decisions.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. We are exposed to credit risk from our operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from our financing activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

(i) Trade receivables

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to our established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The calculation is based on losses historical data. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. We do not hold collateral as security. We evaluate the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and operate in largely independent markets.

(ii) Financial Guarantee Contracts

We are exposed to credit risk in relation to financials guarantee given by us on behalf of joint ventures and other external parties.
Based on the expectations at the end of reporting period, we consider likelihood of any claim under guarantee is remote.

(iii) Financial Instruments and Cash Deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by our treasury department in accordance with our policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by respective Board of Directors on an annual basis, and may be updated throughout the year. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty's potential failure to make payments.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that we may encounter difficulty in meeting our present and future obligations associated with financial liabilities that are required to be settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Our objective is to, at all times, maintain
