With a substantial investment of over ₹ 100 billion for the intra-state component and approximately ₹ 113.69 billion for the inter-state component in Phase-I, the project has already demonstrated its potential to boost demand for high-voltage transmission lines. Although the inter-state component was completed in March 2020, the intra-state component still has 632 ckm of transmission lines to be completed as of June 2024. The upcoming Phase-II of the GEC is expected to witness investments of around ₹ 120 billion, with Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat accounting for approximately 70% of the investments. This phase will play a crucial role in providing connectivity for around 19 GW of renewable capacity, thereby driving demand for high-voltage power cables and conductors. Furthermore, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) will facilitate a credit facility of 33% for State Transmission Utilities (STUs) during the second phase, while the remaining 67% of the project cost can be availed through loans from KfW, PFC, or REC. This financial support is expected to accelerate the completion of the project, leading to a significant increase in demand for power cables and conductors, and subsequently, driving growth in the industry. Overall, the GEC initiative is a testament to the government's commitment to promoting renewable energy and strengthening the country's power transmission infrastructure, which is expected to have a positive impact on the power cables and conductors' industry in the coming years."}, {"bbox": [208, 1054, 730, 1087], "category": "Caption", "text": "Planned grid augmentation under GEC Phase-2"}, {"bbox": [236, 1095, 797, 1538], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [208, 1548, 572, 1573], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: Ministry of Power, Crisil Intelligence"}, {"bbox": [837, 1054, 1368, 1087], "category": "Caption", "text": "GEC Phase-2 estimated project cost (Rs. billion)"}, {"bbox": [837, 1091, 1436, 1567], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><td>State</td><td>Estimated project cost</td><td>Central financial Assistance (CFA)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gujarat</td><td>36.7</td><td>12.0</td></tr><tr><td>Himachal Pradesh</td><td>4.9</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Karnataka</td><td>10.4</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>Kerala</td><td>4.2</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Rajasthan</td><td>9.1</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>Tamil Nadu</td><td>7.2</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>Uttar Pradesh</td><td>48.5</td><td>16.0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>120.9</td><td>39.7</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [192, 1603, 1013, 1635], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Investments in railway sector to aid growth of cables and conductors"}, {"bbox": [192, 1655, 605, 1689], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 100% electrification by fiscal 2026"}, {"bbox": [192, 1709, 1461, 1969], "category": "Text", "text": "The Indian Railways' ambitious plan to achieve 100% electrification by fiscal 2026 is a significant growth driver for the cable and conductor industry.

This will also drive the adoption of advanced cable technologies, such as fiber optic cables and high-temperature resistant cables.
