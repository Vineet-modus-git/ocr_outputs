h) Assets held for sale

The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the sale expected within one year from the date of classification.

For these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange has commercial substance. The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded met only when the assets or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups), its sale is highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned.

The Group treats sale of the asset or disposal group to be highly probable when:

* The appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group),

* An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated (if applicable),

* The asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value,

* The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, and

* Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

Non-current assets held for sale to owners and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the balance sheet. Refer note 52 for further disclosures.

* A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:

* Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,

* Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.

i) Property, plant and equipment

Capital work in progress, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Capital work in progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of the property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit or loss as incurred. No decommissioning liabilities are expected or to be incurred on the assets of plant and equipment.

Expenditure directly relating to construction activity is capitalised. Indirect expenditure incurred during construction period is capitalised as part of the construction costs to the extent the expenditure can be attributable to construction activity or is incidental there to. Income earned during the construction period is deducted from the total of the indirect expenditure.
