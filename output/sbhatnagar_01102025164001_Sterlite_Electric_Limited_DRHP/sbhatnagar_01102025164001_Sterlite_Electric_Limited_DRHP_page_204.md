<table><thead><tr><td>Conductor</td><td>Type</td><td>Description</td><td>Example use cases</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AAC - All Aluminium Conductors</td><td>Conventional</td><td>AAC conductors are made entirely of aluminium, offering high conductivity due to aluminium's low electrical resistance. They are used in low and high voltage overhead lines, particularly in urban areas where spans are short, and high conductivity is critical. However, their relatively low strength-to-weight ratio limits their use in long-span applications.</td><td><strong>Urban Power Distribution:</strong> AAC is ideal for short-span distribution lines in cities due to its high conductivity and lightweight nature, ensuring efficient power delivery in densely populated areas.<br><br><strong>Substation Busbars:</strong> Used in substations where high current-carrying capacity is needed over short distances.<br><br><strong>Coastal Regions:</strong> AAC's corrosion resistance makes it suitable for coastal environments with high humidity and salt exposure.</td></tr><tr><td>ACSR - Aluminium Conductor Steel Reinforced</td><td>Conventional</td><td>ACSR conductors consist of a central steel core surrounded by aluminium strands, combining high strength with good conductivity. The steel core provides mechanical support, making ACSR suitable for long-span overhead power lines. Its high capacity, low weight, and cost-effectiveness make it a popular choice for transmission networks.</td><td><strong>Long-Distance Transmission Lines:</strong> ACSR is widely used in high-voltage transmission lines spanning rivers, valleys, or rural areas due to its strength and ability to handle long spans.<br><br><strong>Rural Electrification:</strong> Employed in rural grids where cost-effective, durable conductors are needed for extended distances.<br><br><strong>High-Wind Areas:</strong> The steel core provides stability in windy or stormy conditions, making ACSR suitable for regions with adverse weather.</td></tr><tr><td>AAAC - All Aluminium Alloy Conductors</td><td>Conventional</td><td>AAAC conductors are made from a high-strength aluminium-magnesium-silicon alloy, offering a better strength-to-weight ratio than AAC and superior corrosion resistance compared to ACSR. They provide improved electrical properties and excellent sag-tension characteristics, making them a preferred choice for specific applications.</td><td><strong>Coastal and Industrial Areas:</strong> AAC's superior corrosion resistance makes it ideal for coastal regions or areas with high pollution levels, such as industrial zones.<br><br><strong>Medium-Span Transmission:</strong> Used in overhead lines where moderate spans require a balance of strength, conductivity, and low sag under thermal loads.<br><br><strong>Renewable Energy Projects:</strong> Employed in wind and solar farm connections due to their lightweight nature and ability to handle variable loads.</td></tr><tr><td>OPGW - Optical Ground Wire/ Optical fibre composite overhead ground wire</td><td>Specialised</td><td>OPGW is a specialized conductor that combines the functions of a ground wire and a communication cable. It consists of optical fibers encased in a protective aluminium or steel tube, surrounded by aluminium or ACSR strands. OPGW serves as an earth wire in transmission lines while enabling high-capacity data transmission, replacing traditional ground wires in modern networks.</td><td><strong>Transmission Line Communication:</strong> OPGW is used in high-voltage transmission lines to provide grounding while enabling data transfer for grid monitoring, control, and telecommunication.<br><br><strong>Intercountry Data Networks:</strong> Facilitates high-capacity data transmission across countries, forming the backbone for utilities, railways, and telecom networks.<br><br><strong>Smart Grid Applications:</strong> Supports real-time monitoring and control in smart grids, enhancing reliability and efficiency in power systems.</td></tr><tr><td>AL-59 alloy conductors</td><td>Specialised</td><td>AL-59 conductors are made from an aluminium-magnesium-silicon alloy with a conductivity of 59% IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard). Their low DC resistance and high current-carrying capacity make them suitable for applications requiring efficient power</td><td><strong>Urban Transmission Lines:</strong> Used in urban areas for medium-voltage lines where high current capacity and corrosion resistance are needed over short to medium spans.</td></tr></tbody></table>
