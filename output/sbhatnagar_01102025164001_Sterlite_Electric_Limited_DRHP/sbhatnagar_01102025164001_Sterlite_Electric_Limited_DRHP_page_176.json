India accounted for 6.5% of global electricity production in 2024, ranking as the 3rd-largest producer of electricity in the world, behind only China and the United States. The country's electricity demand has been driven by several converging forces. A rapidly expanding economy - now among the fastest-growing large economies globally - is stimulating industrial production and expanding commercial activity, which in turn increases base load demand. Simultaneously, rising household incomes and the aspiration for improved quality of life are driving widespread adoption of air conditioners, cooling appliances, and other electricity-intensive devices, especially amid increasingly intense heatwaves that have become more frequent due to climate change."}, {"bbox": [191, 1324, 1460, 1584], "category": "Text", "text": "Another important catalyst is the electrification of new areas of consumption. The government's focus on digital infrastructure is accelerating the rollout of data centres, which require large, uninterrupted power supplies. In addition, the electrification of transport and the early adoption of electric vehicles are beginning to create new demand categories that will expand significantly over the next decade. On the supply side, India is seeing rapid growth in renewable energy capacity, particularly solar and wind power, as the government advances its clean energy targets to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enhance energy security. Policies promoting renewable integration, coupled with targeted incentives and transmission upgrades, are enabling higher shares of variable generation in the grid."}, {"bbox": [191, 1612, 1460, 1774], "category": "Text", "text": "Altogether, these trends underscore that India's power sector sits at the intersection of demographic expansion, urbanisation, industrial growth, and energy transition. The combination of a large and growing population, rising urban concentration, increased electrification of consumption, and ambitious renewable energy goals will continue to drive significant investments in generation capacity, transmission infrastructure, and grid modernisation over the coming decades."}]
