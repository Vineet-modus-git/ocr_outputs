## Quantitative Factors

Some of the information presented below relating to our Company is derived from the Restated Consolidated Financial Information. For details, see “Restated Consolidated Financial Information” on page 292.

Some of the quantitative factors which may form the basis for computing the Offer Price are as follows:

### 1. Basic and diluted earnings per Equity Share of face value ₹2 each (“EPS”):

<table><thead><tr><td>Financial Year ended</td><td>Basic EPS (in ₹)</td><td>Diluted EPS (in ₹)</td><td>Weight</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>March 31, 2025</td><td>12.70</td><td>12.62</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>March 31, 2024</td><td>17.90</td><td>17.79</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>March 31, 2023</td><td>14.41</td><td>14.38</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted Average</td><td>14.72</td><td>14.64</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

**Notes:**

(1) Weighted average = Aggregate of year-wise weighted EPS divided by the aggregate of weights i.e. (EPS x weight) for each year/total of weights.

(2) The face value of each Equity Share is ₹2

(3) Basic earnings per share (in ₹) is calculated by dividing the restated profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Equity Shares outstanding during the year, in accordance with Ind AS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’.

(4) Diluted earnings per share (in ₹) is calculated by dividing the restated profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Equity Shares outstanding during the year as adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential Equity Shares outstanding during the year, in accordance with Ind AS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’.

### 2. Price/Earning (“P/E”) ratio in relation to Price Band of ₹ [•] to ₹ [•] per Equity Share:

<table><thead><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>P/E at the Floor Price (no. of times)*</td><td>P/E at the Cap Price (no. of times)*</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Based on Basic EPS for Financial Year ended March 31, 2025</td><td>[•]</td><td>[•]</td></tr><tr><td>Based on Diluted EPS for Financial Year ended March 31, 2025</td><td>[•]</td><td>[•]</td></tr></tbody></table>

*To be updated upon finalization of the Price Band.
