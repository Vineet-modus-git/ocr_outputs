efficiency, and minimize environmental impact adds to the complexity, making it a challenging task for companies to balance innovation with sustainability and profitability.

## Supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks

The cable and conductor manufacturers rely on globally traded commodities. Any external disruptions can have impact on the cost and delivery schedules. Over the past few years, numerous global events have impacted the sector and have highlighted the fragility of these supply chains. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, such as copper and aluminum, have led to price volatility and shortages, impacting the industry's production and profitability.

Since December 2023 Houthi attacks have squeezed the Red Sea–Suez artery. Major carriers have rerouted round the Cape, reducing global container capacity and adding 10 to 14 days to India-Europe voyages. This has impacted the freight rates, pushing average lead times. Regional conflict in the middle east has kept the pressure high: Israel–Gaza and Israel-Iran hostilities have lifted war-risk premiums, threatening PVC and XLPE feedstock flows critical to insulation lines.

The Ukraine war led to energy shortages and sanctions. This curtailed European smelter increasing copper cost and driving similar spikes in aluminium. Price volatility erodes thin margins and forces Indian manufacturers to hedge larger volumes and stagger purchases.

Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the US and China, have also affected the industry. Taking the example of copper, India relies on copper imports for approximately 40% of its copper supply. The same is expected to come down as newly operational domestic capacity reduces dependence. However, more than half of global copper smelting capacity is in China. Any disruptions in such upstream supply can lead to increased sea freight rates and extended lead times across the globe.

Trade policy of US has added fresh layers of uncertainty. Washington's decision in June 2025 to double tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium imports to 50% impacted futures markets and arbitrage exports of aluminium rods. At the same time, outbound shipments face headwinds after the European Commission slapped anti-dumping duties on Indian optical-fibre cables.

Together, these developments are reshaping sourcing strategies. Cable makers are locking long-term metal off-take with domestic smelters, qualifying alternate polymer suppliers, and rerouting exports via Jawaharlal Nehru Port–Cape of Good Hope loops.

## Dependence on government spending

In India the transmission and distribution sector is a three tiered system comprising of distribution networks, state grids and regional grids. While the demand for power conductor arises from transmission networks and generation associated transmission, the demand for power cable mainly arises from the distribution network (low voltage (up to 33 kV) arial bunched cables). The growth of the power conductors segment is mainly dependent on evacuation systems for power generation capacities. Further, demand for power cables and conductors arises from strengthening of transmission infrastructure. The capex across all these segments is driven by the government and any slowdown in the same will impact the demand for cables and conductors.

## Key emerging trends and recent development in the power cables and conductors' industry:

The power cables and conductors industry in India has experienced significant growth and transformation in recent years, driven by rapid urbanization, industrialization, and the government's push for renewable energy and infrastructure development. Technological advancements are reshaping the industry, with a notable shift toward high-performance conductors and cables tailored for specific applications. High Temperature Low Sag (HTLS) conductors, such as those using INVAR steel, aluminum-zirconium alloys, and composite cores, are increasingly adopted for their ability to carry higher currents with minimal thermal elongation, optimizing power transfer in constrained right-of-way (RoW) areas. Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cables, known for superior tensile strength, low dielectric loss, and resistance to environmental factors, are replacing older insulation materials like PVC, particularly in high-voltage applications up to 220 kV. Additionally, gas-insulated lines (GILs) and superconducting transmission lines (SCTLs) are emerging as viable alternatives for underground and high-capacity transmission, offering lower resistive losses and enhanced reliability in RoW-constrained urban settings. E-beam cross-linked cables, with their higher temperature resistance and reduced thickness, are gaining traction in specialized sectors like solar, railways, and steel mills.

Emerging trends in the industry reflect a strong focus on sustainability and safety, aligning with global and domestic environmental goals. The rising demand for renewable energy has led to the development of specialized solar and wind power cables designed to withstand extreme temperatures, UV radiation, and harsh weather conditions, ensuring efficient power evacuation from photovoltaic modules and wind turbines.
