adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While there has been no instance where we failed to obtain regulatory approvals in the last three Fiscals which had an adverse impact on our operations, we cannot assure you that such instance will not arise in the future. Further, while there has been no instance in the last three Fiscals where our license was suspended or cancelled by any regulatory authority which impacted our operations, we cannot assure you that such instance will not arise in the future.

**10. We operate in a competitive business environment. Failure to compete effectively against our competitors and new entrants to the industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition results of operations and cash flows.**

We face significant competition in our business from other power transmission suppliers and manufacturers and providers of MSI services. For information on certain financial information of our competitors, see “*Our Business – Competition*” and “*Industry Overview – Financial parameters*” on pages 242 and 205, respectively. We also bid for certain projects, and the growth of our business depends on our ability to win tenders in a competitive bidding process. We cannot assure you that we would bid where we have been prequalified to submit a bid or that our bids, when submitted would be accepted.

Our competitors may have substantially greater financial, management, research and marketing resources than we have as a result of which they may be able to utilise their resources and economies of scale to develop improved products, divert sales away from us by winning broader contracts or hire our employees by offering more lucrative compensation packages. In particular, aggressive pricing strategies adopted by such competitors could compel us to lower our prices, resulting in reduced margins and potential loss of market share. Any sustained pressure on pricing or market share could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technology, technical qualifications, post contract performance, price and availability of key professional personnel. Our failure to compete effectively with respect to any of these or other factors could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.

**11. Any disruption or delays with respect to our MSI projects could adversely affect our financial and operational estimates and projections, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.**

Our MSI services consist of grid-uprating and grid-upgrade solutions to enhance the capacity, reliability and efficiency of existing transmission infrastructure. MSI projects are labour- and equipment-intensive and must often be performed on live or brown-field transmission lines located in difficult terrain. We may encounter shortages of technically skilled personnel, contractor defaults, work-stoppages, labour unrest, adverse weather, natural calamities or accidents. Any of these events can delay completion, increase costs and expose us to liquidated damages, warranty claims or contract termination. Further, the majority of our MSI contracts are fixed-price arrangements. Unanticipated increases in raw-material prices (aluminium, steel, copper, optical fibres), freight rates or labour wages can erode anticipated margins. Delays in achieving commissioning milestones may also trigger additional interest or financing costs and reduce profitability.

MSI contracts are awarded by central and state utilities whose capital-expenditure plans are subject to annual budget approvals, tariff regulations and governmental policy changes. Modifications in tax regimes, environmental clearances or import duties on critical components could alter project economics or defer award timelines, thereby affecting our order book and revenue visibility. Further, delays in the release of budgetary allocations or disputes over milestone certifications can lengthen our receivables collection period and strain working capital. MSI work involves high-voltage operations, working at height, and deployment of heavy equipment in geographically challenging areas. Despite adherence to statutory safety norms and insurance coverage, accidents, electrocution, fires or structural failures could result in personal injury claims, regulatory penalties, project shutdowns and reputational damage. Certain customer agreements incorporate provisions under which the occurrence of more than one fatality at a project site within the same fiscal year may trigger the customer's right to debar us from future tenders. Any such incident occurring while undertaking the projects could also adversely affect the perception of equity partners and export customers, thereby potentially limiting future business opportunities and materially impacting our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Further, we bid for MSI projects through a competitive bidding process, where projects are awarded following competitive bidding processes and satisfaction of prescribed qualification criteria such as past experience in handling projects. While we have, in the past, been awarded certain MSI contracts, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be awarded such contracts. In addition, the government conducted tender processes may be subject to change in qualification criteria, unexpected delays and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the projects for which we bid will be tendered within a reasonable time, or at all. We are not in a position to predict whether and when we will be awarded a new contract.

**12. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and we have been subject to environmental notices in respect of certain of our transmission lines and may be subject to further notices in the future.**

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to a wide range of increasingly strict environmental, health and safety requirements in India. The environmental impact of a particular manufacturing facility typically depends on the location of the project and the surrounding ecosystem. These requirements address, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, releases into
