The share of organized players has improved between Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2025 from approximately 68 to 70% to 76 to 78%. Consequently, share of unorganized industry has dropped from 30 to 32% in Fiscal 2019 to 2022 to 24% in Fiscal 2025. Additionally, within the overall industry, share of organized players is relatively higher in cables like power transmission cables. Moving forward, the share of organized players is expected to increase further as the industry consolidates.

## Cables and wires production crossed 21 million km in Fiscal 2025

In Fiscal 2025, cables and wire production in India crossed 21 million km, up from 16 million km in Fiscal 2019, registering a CAGR growth of 5.2%. Out of the 21.7 million km, cables accounted for approximately 9.5 million km in Fiscal 2025. Major factors contributing to this growth included an overall upswing in exports, favourable government initiatives such as the REC, rural electrification programs and demand stemming from various segments. Notably, the production of High Voltage (HV) and Extra-High Voltage (EHV) cables (Above 33 KV) registered a strong CAGR of 53.8% from Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2025, primarily due to increased investments in power transmission infrastructure and ambitious grid modernization projects supporting renewable energy integration. Medium Voltage (MV) and High Voltage (HV) (3.3 to 33KV) benefitted from ongoing electrification and industrial and urban expansion, as well as upgrades in distribution networks to meet rising demand and enhance reliability. Elastomeric cables saw a CAGR of 30.4% from Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2025 driven by their adoption in specialized, demanding environment across heavy engineering, automotive, railways and infrastructure where flexibility, heat resistance and durability are critical requirements. The post-pandemic recovery in construction activity has simultaneously bolstered demand for building wires and switchboard cables, as rapid urbanization and infrastructure projects surged.

Collectively, the growth momentum for specialty product segments is underpinned by strategic sectoral investments, evolving industry requirements, technological advancements, and a supportive policy environment all contributing to the sector's expansion.
