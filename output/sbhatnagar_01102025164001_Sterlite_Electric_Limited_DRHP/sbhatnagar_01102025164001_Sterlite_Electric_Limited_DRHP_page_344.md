ANNEXURE-VI

Notes to the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements
(All amounts in Rupees million unless otherwise stated)

At each reporting date, the management analyses the movement of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or reassessed as per the Group's accounting policies. For this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.

The management in conjunction with the external valuers also compares the change in fair value of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. The valuation results are discussed at the Audit Committee.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained above.

This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes.

### f) i. Revenue recognition

#### Revenue from contract with customers

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of goods and service tax (GST).

The disclosures of material accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in note 37.

#### Sale of power products and traded goods

Revenue from the sale of power products and traded goods are recognised at a point upon delivery of conductor, power cable or traded aluminium ingots and rods and payment is generally due within 30 to 180 days from invoice. Some contracts provide the Group right to receive price variation from customers on account of changes in metal prices.

#### Revenue from Engineering, procurement and construction ('EPC') contracts

Revenue from fixed price construction contracts for power transmission lines and supply and installation of power transmission products is recognised as the performance obligation is satisfied progressively over the contract period. The Group's progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion that the contract expenses incurred to date bear to the estimated total contract expenses. Payment is due as per the achievement of contractual milestones.
