For instance, our Company and Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited have entered into a joint venture agreement to set up 'Maharashtra Transmission Communication Infrastructure Limited' (\"MTCIL\"), with our Company holding 51% for developing OPGW network in Maharashtra. Similarly, through PPP with Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (\"GMDA\"), we have built a 130 km optical fibre network in Gurugram which we will manage and maintain for 21 years. We also offer spare OPGW fibres on long lease basis to large telecom service providers.
