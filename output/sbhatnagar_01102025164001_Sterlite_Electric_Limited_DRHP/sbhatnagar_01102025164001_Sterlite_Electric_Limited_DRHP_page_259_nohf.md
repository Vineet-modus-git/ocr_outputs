## Key manufacturing processes: Aluminium Conductors

1. **Aluminium ingot procurement and inspection:** High-purity aluminium ingots (typically EC grade) are procured from certified suppliers. These ingots are inspected for chemical composition, surface defects, and weight. Only ingots meeting the required standards are accepted for further processing.

2. **Rolling Mill:** The inspected ingots are melted in a reverberatory or induction furnace at controlled temperatures. Once molten, the aluminium is cast into continuous cast rods (usually 9.5 mm diameter) using a continuous casting and rolling ("CCR") line. This ensures uniformity in grain structure and conductivity.

3. **Wire Drawing:** The rolled rods are drawn through a series of tungsten carbide dies to reduce the diameter to the required wire gauge. This process is done in multiple stages and may include intermediate annealing. The drawn wire is collected on bobbins or spools.

4. **Annealing (optional):** If the drawn wire is too hard or brittle for stranding, it undergoes annealing in a furnace. This softens the wire, improves ductility, and makes it suitable for further processing. Annealing parameters depend on wire size and application.

5. **Stranding:** Multiple aluminium wires are twisted together using a stranding machine to form a conductor. The stranding pattern (e.g., concentric, sectoral) depends on the cable design. Stranding improves flexibility and current carrying capacity.

6. **Testing and Quality Control:** Finished cables undergo rigorous electrical, mechanical, and dimensional testing as per IS/IEC standards. Tests include high voltage, insulation resistance, conductor resistance, and visual inspection. Only compliant cables are approved.

7. **Final packing and dispatch:** Approved cables are cut to specified lengths, labelled, and packed in drums or coils. Each package includes product details, batch number, and test certificates. The finished goods are then dispatched or stored in finished goods inventory.

## Power Cables

Power cables are electrical cables consisting of two or more wires or conductors bundled together, often with insulation and protective covering. Power cables are mainly used for power transmission and distribution. We manufacture a wide range of power cables ranging from 3.3/6.6 kV to 220 kV. Our power cables portfolio includes medium voltage, high voltage and extra high voltage cables. We manufacture and supply solar cables (i.e., low tension direct current ("LTDC")) and intend to manufacture array cables. We also supply fibre-integrated power cables, and high-ampacity cables designed for long-distance power transmission with minimal energy losses.

Below are the details of our extra-high voltage and medium voltage cables:

* Our extra-high-voltage cables are engineered for 38/66 kV (72.5 kV) up to 127/220 kV (245 kV), built with either copper or aluminium conductors in sizes ranging from 240 sq mm to 2,500 sq mm, while a 185 sq mm option is reserved for the 38/66 kV grade alone, finished with an outer sheath of HDPE, MDPE or an LSZH variant for fire safety, and protected by a graphite-coated or extruded semiconducting polyethylene outer conductive layer to ensure uniform electrical stress control and long-term reliability.

* Our medium-voltage cables, built for systems from 3.3/6.6 kV to 18/33 kV, feature copper or aluminium conductors in sizes ranging from 95 sq mm to 1,000 sq mm and are offered in armoured or unarmoured constructions. Outer sheath options include PVC, HDPE, MDPE or an LSZH variant to suit environmental and fire-safety requirements. Anti-termite protection is provided through a nylon sheath, double brass or stainless-steel tape, or specially formulated additives, ensuring long-term durability in vulnerable installations.

Our power cables are tested as per applicable IS and IEC standards and are also certified for quality and endurance under several international accreditation programmes.
