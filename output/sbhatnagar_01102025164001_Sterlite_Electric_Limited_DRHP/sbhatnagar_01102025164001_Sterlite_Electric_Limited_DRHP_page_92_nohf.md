**50. Damage to and/or malfunction of any of our information security systems or cyber security risks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.**

We have information technology systems and tools that support our business processes, including product development, production, sales and purchase, finance, inventory, and human resource management. We have made, and will continue to make, investments in information technology systems and tools. Such expenditure may adversely affect our operating results if they are not offset by corresponding increase in our operational efficiency.

An external information security breach, such as a hacker attack, fraud, a virus or worm malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, security breaches, or an internal problem with information protection, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt our business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information unauthorized access to our systems, misappropriation of information or data, deletion or modification of users information, or a denial of service or other interruption to our business operations. While there has been no instance in the last three Fiscals, where we experienced technology failure which had an adverse impact on the business operations of our Company, we cannot assure you that such instance will not arise in the future. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to implement and sustain the proper IT infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors and processing inefficiencies. Challenges relating to the revamping or implementation of new IT structures can also subject us to certain errors, inefficiencies, disruptions and, in some instances, loss of consumers. Our IT systems and the systems of our third party IT service providers may also be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues.

**51. We may not be able to identify or correct defects or irregularities in title to the properties which we own, lease or intend to acquire in connection with the development of our projects as land title can be uncertain. Additionally, certain land on which our projects are located may be subject to third party rights or onerous conditions which may adversely affect its use.**

There is no central title registry for immoveable property in India and the documentation of land records in India has not been fully digitized. Property records in India are generally maintained at the state and district level and in local languages and are updated manually through physical records. Therefore, property records may not be available online for inspection, may be illegible, untraceable, and incomplete, may not have been updated, may be inaccurate in certain respects, or may have been kept in poor condition, which may impede title investigations or our ability to rely on such property records. Title to land in India is often fragmented, and in many cases, land may have multiple owners. Title may also suffer from irregularities, such as non-execution or non-registration of conveyance deeds and inadequate stamping, and may be subjected to encumbrances that we are unaware of and that may not be apparent on the face of the relevant documentation. Any defects in, or irregularities of, title may result in a loss of development or operating rights over the land, which may prejudice the success of our projects.

Improperly executed, unregistered or insufficiently stamped conveyance instruments in a property's chain of title, unregistered encumbrances in favor of third parties, rights of adverse possessors, ownership claims of family members of prior owners or third parties, or other defects that a purchaser may not be aware of can affect title to a property. As a result, potential disputes or claims over title to the land on which our projects are located or will be constructed may arise. An adverse decision from a court or the absence of an agreement may result in additional costs and delays in the construction and operating phases of any projects situated on such land. Also, such disputes, whether resolved in our favor or not, may divert management's attention, harm our reputation or otherwise disrupt our business. While no such instances have occurred in the last three Fiscals, we cannot assure you that such an instance may arise in the future which may have an adverse impact on our usage of the land.

**52. Any failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate in will expose us to criminal liability, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.**

We operate in multiple jurisdictions, each with stringent anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws ("AML"), and compliance with these laws is critical to our operations. Any violation, whether intentional or inadvertent, could result in severe criminal liability, including substantial fines, penalties, and imprisonment for our employees and executives. Such violations could also lead to significant reputational damage, loss of business opportunities, and increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Failure to adhere to anti-corruption and AML regulations may disrupt our operations, affect our financial stability, and undermine stakeholder trust. We are committed to maintaining robust compliance programs and conducting regular training to ensure that all employees understand and adhere to these legal requirements. However, the complexity and evolving nature of these laws pose ongoing challenges, and any lapses in compliance could have serious adverse effects on our business and financial health. While we have not had any such instances of lapses in compliance with anti-corruption and AML regulations in the past three Fiscals, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur in future.

**53. Our Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offer for Sale portion.**
