## Financial assets at amortised cost

A 'financial asset' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and

b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

This category is the most relevant to the Group. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. This category generally applies to loans, trade and other receivables included under non-current financial assets. For more information on receivables, refer to note 8, note 9 and note 10.

## Financial assets at FVTOCI

A 'financial asset' is classified as FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and

b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI.

Financial assets included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Group recognizes interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI financial asset is reported as interest income using the EIR method.

## Financial assets at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for financial assets. Any financial asset, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.

Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## Equity instruments

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Group makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit or loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
