The Code on Social Security, 2020 ('Code') relating to employee benefits during employment and post employment benefits received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. Certain sections of the Code came into effect on 3 May 2023. However, the final rules/interpretation have not yet been issued. Based on a preliminary assessment, the entity believes the impact of the change will not be significant.
