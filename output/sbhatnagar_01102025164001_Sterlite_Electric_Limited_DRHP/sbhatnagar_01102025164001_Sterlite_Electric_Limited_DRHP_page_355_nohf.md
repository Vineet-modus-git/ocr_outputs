recognizes contribution payable to such funds as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.

The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan in India which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method at Group level.

Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss:

* Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and

* Net interest expense or income

Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee benefit. The group measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The group recognizes expected cost of short-term employee benefit as an expense, when an employee renders the related service.

The group treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes. Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the reporting date. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken to the statement of profit and loss and are not deferred. The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

q) Share based payments

The Group issues equity-settled options to certain employees. These are measured at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share-based options is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.

Fair value is measured using Black-Scholes framework and is recognized as an expense, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the options vest using the graded vesting method. The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The expected volatility and forfeiture assumptions are based on historical information.
