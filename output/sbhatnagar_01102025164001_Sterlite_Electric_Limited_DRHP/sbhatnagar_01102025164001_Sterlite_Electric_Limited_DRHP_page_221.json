Power conductor industry has high working capital requirements, given long gestation periods. The industry's profile is further constrained by the raw material price risk and stiff competition. As raw material cost accounts for nearly 70 to 75% of net sales, effective inventory management remains critical, especially given the prevalent volatility in global commodity prices. In cable industry too, a prevalent challenge lies in the volatility of raw material prices. Particularly the surge in costs for essential materials like copper, zinc, and aluminium. This price increase significantly affects profit margins within the industry. However, in large contracts, which includes transmission and distribution companies in India, the price adjustment clause has been mandated. Hence, executing contracts with price escalation clauses and hedging the cost of key raw materials also protects players from volatility of raw material prices."}, {"bbox": [191, 503, 722, 540], "category": "Caption", "text": "Aluminium prices (London metal exchange)"}, {"bbox": [202, 570, 1446, 1019], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [191, 1102, 1458, 1205], "category": "Text", "text": "Note: The prices listed above represent the average annual prices for aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) for the respective calendar years.\nSource: LME, Crisil Intelligence"}, {"bbox": [191, 1231, 831, 1267], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Weak financial health of state distribution companies"}, {"bbox": [191, 1284, 1458, 1480], "category": "Text", "text": "The distribution sector is controlled by state distribution utilities (SDU) with private participation limited to circles such as Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Delhi, Agra, and Kolkata.
