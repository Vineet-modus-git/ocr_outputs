or PBT loose tube containing the coloured fibres, and its purpose is to protect the fibres from mechanical stress and environmental exposure.

2. *Konform process:* It takes inputs of pre-cleaned aluminium rod, HC wire, $H_3PO_4$, and hot water; the process compacts and cleans the rods into a solid aluminium core using the Konform technique, yielding a Konform rod or core whose purpose is to form the cable's central strength member.

3. *Wire drawing:* It uses Aluminium Clad Steel wire as input; the process draws ACS wires to precise diameters and outputs finished ACS wire whose purpose is to provide mechanical strength and electrical conductivity.

4. *Stranding core:* It combines inputs of Konform rod and SS tube or PBT core; the process strands the central core with optical units and strength members, producing a stranded core whose purpose is to form the basic structure of the OPGW cable.

5. *Final stranding:* It brings together inputs of stranded core, ACS wires, and SS tube; the process strands outer layers of ACS wires around the core, outputting the finished OPGW cable whose purpose is to ensure cable integrity, strength, and electrical performance.

## Master Systems Integration Services ("MSI Services")

We provide solutions for the upgrade and uprate of existing transmission infrastructure projects as part of our MSI services. Our MSI services projects include upgrading existing infrastructure, increasing throughput, increasing uprate of overhead conductors, implementing OPGW-based reliable communication systems, and connecting new HPC lines. Below are the salient features of our MSI services:

* *System planning and optimisation.* We leverage our in-house expertise on power systems to support our customers in their system planning, optimisation and forecasting needs. We help our customers specify their needs and co-create solutions that help them upgrade existing infrastructure in preparation for the future.

* *Feasibility studies and detailed engineering.* Our design and engineering assessment teams conduct surveys and feasibility studies through third parties and develop detailed engineering solutions that optimize our customers' space and time constraints. We utilise technologies such as monopoles, micro piling to design solutions that aim to minimise corridor footprint.

* *Project management and execution.* We leverage our technological and project management strengths to help our customers uprate, upgrade and strengthen their existing infrastructure with the aim of minimal outage and disruptions. We also employ various aerial technologies such as drones to string OPGW wires and overhead conductors safely and efficiently.

## Convergence

Our convergence business leverages existing power utility infrastructure (such as OPGW, transmission towers, distribution towers and substations) for telecommunications purposes by building optical fibre infrastructure on top of existing utilities networks. Our offerings include dark fiber, optical fibre link routes and co-location facilities (edge data centers), and intracity and intercity fiber networks (including smart city projects) through public-private partnerships. For instance, our Company and Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited have entered into a joint venture agreement to set up 'Maharashtra Transmission Communication Infrastructure Limited' ("MTCIL"), with our Company holding 51% for developing OPGW network in Maharashtra. Similarly, through PPP with Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority ("GMDA"), we have built a 130 km optical fibre network in Gurugram which we will manage and maintain for 21 years. We also offer spare OPGW fibres on long lease basis to large telecom service providers. We have received the 15th edition Aegis Graham Bell Award in the innovation in digital infrastructure category
