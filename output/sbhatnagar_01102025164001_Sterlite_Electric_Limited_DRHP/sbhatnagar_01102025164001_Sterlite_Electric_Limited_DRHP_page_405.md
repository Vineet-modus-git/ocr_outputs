## NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group's principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, acceptances, trade and other payables, lease liabilities and other financial liabilities. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's operations. The Group's principal financial assets include investments, loans, trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits and other financial assets that derive directly from its operations. The Group also holds FVTOCI investments and enters into derivative transactions.

The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest risk. The Group's senior management oversees the management of these risks. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Group's policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Group reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.

The Risk Management policies of the Group are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the group's activities.

Management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.

### (a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.

The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on: the carrying values of gratuity and provisions.

The following assumption has been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:

The sensitivity of the relevant statement of profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

#### (i) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rate primarily relates to the Group's long term debt obligations with floating interest rates.

The Group is exposed to the interest rate fluctuation in both domestic and foreign currency borrowing. As at 31 March 2024: 1.60% of the Group's borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (31 March 2023: 9.08%)

#### (ii) Interest rate sensitivity

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of loans and borrowings affected. With all the other variables held constant, the Group's profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="2">(in Rs. million)</th></tr><tr><th>Increase/decrease in basis points</th><th>Effect on profit before tax</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>31 March 2025*</strong></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>+50</td><td>(13.86)</td></tr><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>-50</td><td>13.86</td></tr><tr><td><strong>31 March 2024*</strong></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>+50</td><td>(33.53)</td></tr><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>-50</td><td>33.53</td></tr><tr><td><strong>31 March 2023</strong></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>+50</td><td>(216.06)</td></tr><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>-50</td><td>216.06</td></tr></tbody></table>

* Pertaining to continuing operations

#### (iii) Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the group's operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and foreign currency borrowings.

The Group has a policy to keep minimum foreign exposure on the books that are likely to occur within a maximum 12-month period for hedges of forecasted sales and purchases.

When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Group negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure. For hedges of forecast transactions the derivatives cover the period of exposure from the point the cash flows of the transactions are forecasted up to the point of settlement of the resulting receivable or payable that is denominated in the foreign currency.

Out of total foreign currency exposure, the Group has hedged most of the exposure except unhedged portion mentioned in note 44(b).
