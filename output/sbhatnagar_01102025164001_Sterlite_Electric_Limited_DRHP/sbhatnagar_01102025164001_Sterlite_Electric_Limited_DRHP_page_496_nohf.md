2. Pravin Agarwal, ("Petitioner") our Chairman and Non-Executive Director, filed a criminal petition before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh to quash proceedings initiated against him under section 53 and 55 of the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Services) Act 1996 before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Sehore (Chief Judicial Magistrate"). The Petitioner challenged the order passed by Chief Judicial Magistrate directing registration of criminal case against him, in his capacity as a director of Bhopal Dhule Transmission Company Limited ("BDTCL"). The case arose from collapse of a transmission tower being erected for BDTCL which resulted in injuries to contract workers due to collapse. The Petitioner has contended that he had ceased to be a director of BDTCL and therefore was neither in charge nor responsible on the date the alleged offence was committed. The matter is currently pending.
