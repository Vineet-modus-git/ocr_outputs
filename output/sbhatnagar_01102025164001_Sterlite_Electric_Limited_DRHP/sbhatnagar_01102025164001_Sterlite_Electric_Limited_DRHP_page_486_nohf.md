optimum levels of liquidity to meet our cash and collateral obligations. We require funds both for short term operational needs as well as for long term investment programs mainly in growth projects. We closely monitor our liquidity position and deploy a robust cash management system. We aim to minimise these risks by generating sufficient cash flows from our current operations, which in addition to the available cash and cash equivalents, liquid investments and sufficient committed fund facilities, will provide liquidity.

The liquidity risk is managed on the basis of expected maturity dates of the financial liabilities. The average credit period taken to settle trade payables is about 45 days to 180 days. The other payables are with short term durations. The carrying amounts are assumed to be reasonable approximation of fair value.
