ANNEXURE-VI

Notes to the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements
(All amounts in Rupees million unless otherwise stated)

Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Ind AS 117 replaces Ind AS 104 Insurance Contracts. Ind AS 117 applies to all types of insurance contracts, regardless of the type of entities that issue them as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features; a few scope exceptions will apply. Ind AS 117 is based on a general model, supplemented by:

* A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)

* A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts

The application of Ind AS 117 had no impact on the Group's financial statements as the Group has not entered any contracts in the nature of insurance contracts covered under Ind AS 117.
