Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside statement of profit or loss is recognised outside statement of profit or loss.
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

## Goods and Service Tax paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses

Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of Goods and Service tax paid, except:

* When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable

* When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included

The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

## Non Current Assets held for Sale

The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the sale expected within one year from the date of classification.

For these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange has commercial substance. The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded met only when the assets or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups), its sale is highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned.

The Group treats sale of the asset or disposal group to be highly probable when:

* The appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group),

* An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated (if applicable),

* The asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value,

* The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, and

* Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

Non-current assets held for sale to owners and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the balance sheet.

* A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:

* Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,

* Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.

## Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Capital work in progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of the property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
