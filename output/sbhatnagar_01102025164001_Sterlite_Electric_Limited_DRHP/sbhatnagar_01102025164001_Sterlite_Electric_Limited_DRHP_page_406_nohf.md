(iv) Foreign currency sensitivity

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EUR exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group's profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. The impact on the Group's profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. The Group's exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material. With all the other variable held constant, the Group's profit before tax is affected through the impact on change of foreign currency rate as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"></th><th rowspan="2">Change in USD rate</th><th colspan="3">(Rs. in million)</th></tr><tr><th>Effect on profit before tax</th><th>Change in Euro rate</th><th>Effect on profit before tax</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>31 March 2025*</td><td>+5%<br/>-5%</td><td>3.56<br/>(3.56)</td><td>+5%<br/>-5%</td><td>0.26<br/>(0.26)</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2024*</td><td>+5%<br/>-5%</td><td>(0.49)<br/>0.49</td><td>+5%<br/>-5%</td><td>(0.16)<br/>0.16</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023</td><td>+5%<br/>-5%</td><td>(2.54)<br/>2.54</td><td>+5%<br/>-5%</td><td>(0.10)<br/>0.10</td></tr></tbody></table>

(v) Commodity price risk

The Group is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing purchase of Aluminium, Copper and Lead for manufacture of conductor, OPGW and power cables and therefore requires a continuous supply of these commodities. Due to the volatility of the price of aluminium, copper and lead, the Group enters into various purchase contracts for these commodities on London Metal Exchange. The prices in these purchase contracts are linked to the price on London Metal Exchange.

The Company's Board of Directors has developed and enacted a risk management strategy regarding commodity price risk and its mitigation.

Based on forecasted delivery plans, the Group hedges the aluminium, lead and copper price using future commodity contracts. The forecast is deemed to be highly probable.

Commodity price sensitivity

As per the Group's policy for commodity price hedging, all the commodity price exposures as on reporting dates are fully hedged. Thus, there are no open unhedged exposures on the reporting dates.

Equity price risk

The Group has invested in compulsorily convertible debentures, compulsorily convertible preference share and unlisted equity securities which are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities. The Group manages the equity price risk by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments. Reports on the equity portfolio are submitted to the Group's senior management on a regular basis. The Holding Company's Board of Directors reviews and approves all equity investment decisions.

At the reporting date, the exposure to mutual fund units, compulsorily convertible debentures, compulsorily convertible preference share and unlisted equity securities at fair value is Rs. Nil (31 March 2024: Rs. 3,456.95 million, 31 March 2023: Rs. 1,753.89 million). Sensitivity analysis of these investments have been provided in note 54.

(b) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

(i) Trade receivables

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group's established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The calculation is based on losses historical data. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. The group does not hold collateral as security. The group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and operate in largely independent markets.

Discontinued Operations:

The Group is also engaged in transmission infrastructure development business under BOOM (Build, Own, Operate and Maintain) and BOOT (Build, Own, Operate and Transfer) and currently derive its revenue primarily from contracts with long term transmission customers ('LTTC'). The Group being transmission licensee receives payments as per the pooling arrangements specified under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Sharing of Inter State Transmission Charges and Losses) Regulations, 2020 ('Pooling Regulations'). In the PoC method, the transmission charges to be recovered from the entire system are allocated between users based on their location in the grid. Under the PoC mechanism, all the charges collected by the Central Transmission Utility ('CTU') from LTTC's are disbursed pro-rata to all Transmission Service Providers ('TSPs') from the pool in proportion of the respective billed amount. Due to this, the TSPs are shielded against any potential default by a particular customer. If a particular customer delays or defaults, the delay or shortfall is prorated amongst all the TSPs. Based on past history of payments, payments due have always been paid and there have been no write-off's for due amounts. Due to the payment mechanism explained above as well as due to no history of any write-off's of payments which were due, the Group has not considered any expected credit loss on the financial assets in the nature of trade receivables of transmission business. During the various periods presented, there has been no change in the credit risk of trade receivables of transmission business. However, this assessment may need a review if there is any change in the Pooling Regulations.

(ii) Financial guarantee contracts

The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to financials guarantee given by the Group on behalf of joint ventures and other external parties. The Group's maximum exposure in this regard is the maximum amount the Group could have to pay if the guarantee is called on as at 31 March 2025 is Rs. Nil [31 March 2024: Rs. 3,616.99 million (pertaining of continuing operations is Rs. Nil), 31 March 2023: Rs. 2,549.10 million]. Based on the expectations at the end of reporting period, the Group considers likelihood of any claim under guarantee is remote.

(iii) Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group's treasury department in accordance with the Group's policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by respective Company's Board of Directors on an annual basis, and may be updated throughout the year. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty's potential failure to make payments.

The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 is the carrying amounts of each class of financial assets except for financial guarantees and derivative financial instruments. The Group's maximum exposure relating to financial guarantees and financial derivative instruments is noted in Note 44 and the liquidity table below.
