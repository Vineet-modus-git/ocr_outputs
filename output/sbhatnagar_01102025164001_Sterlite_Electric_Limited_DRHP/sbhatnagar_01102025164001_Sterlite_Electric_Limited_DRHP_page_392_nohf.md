**Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)**

The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation. The underlying bonds are further reviewed for quality. Those having excessive credit spreads are excluded from the analysis of bonds on which the discount rate is based, on the basis that they do not represent high quality corporate bonds.

The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables for the specific countries. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the respective countries.

Further details about gratuity obligations are given in Note 39.

**Fair value measurement of financial instruments**

When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the DCF model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. See Note 54 and 55 for further disclosures.

**Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract assets**

The Group performs an impairment analysis at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The calculation is based on historical observed data for defaults. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. Further, for companies engaged in the power infrastructure business, major receivables are from few customers and is based on point of connection mechanism (refer Note 26), hence the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables is low.

**Assumption used in Restricted Stock Units/Employee Stock Options Plan**

The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees using Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of options. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions relating to vesting of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 50.

**Useful life of property, plant and equipment**

The estimates and assumptions made to determine the carrying value and related depreciation are critical to the financial position and performance of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset's expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. Increasing an asset's expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The useful lives and residual values of the assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.
