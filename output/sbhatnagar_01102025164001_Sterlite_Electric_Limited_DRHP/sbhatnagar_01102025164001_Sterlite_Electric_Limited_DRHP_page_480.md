## Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically financed the expansion of our business and operations primarily through the funds generated from our operations and debt financing. From time to time, we may obtain loan facilities to finance our short term working capital requirements and investments in our business such as capital expenditures. We believe that after taking into account the expected cash to be generated from our business and operations, the Net Proceeds from the Fresh Issue and the proceeds from our existing bank loans, we will have sufficient capital to meet our anticipated capital requirements for our working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
