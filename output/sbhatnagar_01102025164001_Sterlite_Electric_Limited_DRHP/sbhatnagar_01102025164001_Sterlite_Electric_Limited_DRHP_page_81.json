We may not be able to successfully implement new technologies effectively or adapt our processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards.

Our ability to adopt and/or implement new technology in a timely manner may also be adversely impacted by government policy and bureaucracy. In addition, the cost of implementing new technologies, upgrading networks or expanding network capacity to effectively respond to technological changes may be substantial. Our ability to meet such costs will, in turn, depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially acceptable terms. Moreover, new technologies may not develop according to anticipated schedules, or perform according to expectations or be commercially accepted. If we fail to adopt and successfully implement new technologies in a cost-effective manner, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be negatively affected. Further, our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products (as part of our MSI business) on a timely basis is a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary technological knowledge that will allow us to develop our product portfolio in this manner. If we are unable to obtain such knowledge in a timely manner, or at all, we may be unable to effectively implement our strategies, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products will not become obsolete.
