## FISCAL 2025 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2024 - CONTINUING OPERATIONS

### Total Income

Total income increased by 0.86% from ₹ 49,548.34 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 49,974.03 million in Fiscal 2025 on account of an increase in revenue from operations and other income for the reasons indicated below:

#### Revenue from Operations

Revenue from operations increased by 0.77% from ₹ 49,178.94 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 49,557.60 million in Fiscal 2025 primarily on account of (i) an increase in other operating revenue in terms of (a) scrap sales from ₹ 275.12 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 396.67 million in Fiscal 2025; and (b) in management fees from ₹ 332.55 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 879.46 million in Fiscal 2025. This was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from contract with customers - sale of goods and services from ₹ 48,571.27 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 48,281.47 million in Fiscal 2025.
