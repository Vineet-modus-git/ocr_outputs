Additionally, certain suppliers may lack the capacity to accommodate sudden increases in order volumes or may prioritize other customers over us. Ensuring a stable and reliable supply of raw materials is crucial for maintaining consistent production schedules and fulfilling customer demands. While we have not had any such instances where we faced quality issues or disruption in the supply chain from such suppliers in the last three Fiscals, we cannot assure you that such instances will not arise in the future. For instance, we source carbon composite core, used to manufacture ACCC conductors, from a single supplier. Any disruption in the supply of carbon composite core, whether due to operational issues, financial instability, regulatory changes, or natural disasters, could significantly impact our production capabilities for ACCC conductors. Additionally, any quality issues or delays in the delivery of carbon core could lead to production delays, increased costs, and potential contractual penalties. Furthermore, our reliance on a single supplier limits our bargaining power and may result in higher procurement costs. If the supplier were to increase prices or if we were unable to renew our supply agreement on favourable terms, our cost structure could be adversely affected, to the extent we are unable to pass on the increased prices to our customers."}, {"bbox": [147, 1296, 1554, 1585], "category": "Text", "text": "The prices and supply of these primary raw materials are also affected by, among others, general economic conditions, competition, production costs and levels, transportation costs, indirect taxes and import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rate. Further, as we source our raw materials from third parties, our supply chain may be interrupted by circumstances beyond our control. Poor quality roads and other transportation-related infrastructure problems, inclement weather, natural disasters and road accidents may disrupt the transportation of raw materials.
