* **Renewable Purchase Obligation:** The Bill specifies that renewable purchase obligations (RPO) should not be below a minimum percentage prescribed by the central government, and failure to meet RPO will be punishable with a penalty.
* **Selection Committee for SERCs:** The Bill replaces the Chairperson of the Central Electricity Authority or the Chairperson of the CERC with a nominee of the central government in the selection committee to recommend appointments to the SERCs.
* **Composition of Commissions and APTEL:** The Bill increases the number of members in SERCs from three to four and requires at least one member in both the CERC and SERCs to be from a law background. The Bill also provides that the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) will have three or more members, as may be prescribed by the central government.

These amendments aim to promote competition, improve the efficiency of the electricity sector, and enhance the role of regulatory commissions in ensuring a reliable and sustainable electricity supply.

## Guidelines for tariff based competitive bidding process for procurement power from grid connected wind solar hybrid projects

The Guidelines for tariff-based competitive bidding process for procurement of power from grid-connected wind-solar hybrid projects aim to promote competitive procurement of electricity from these projects to protect consumer interests. The specific objectives of these Guidelines are to facilitate renewable capacity addition and fulfillment of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) requirements of distribution companies (DISCOMs). Additionally, the Guidelines aim to ensure transparency and fairness in procurement processes and provide a standardized framework for intermediaries (aggregators/traders) for inter-state sale-purchase of long-term power at competitive prices. Furthermore, the Guidelines establish a risk-sharing framework between stakeholders and ensure reasonable returns to investors, encouraging further investments and enhancing project bankability.

These Guidelines are applicable to long-term procurement of electricity through competitive bidding from hybrid power projects with a bid capacity of 10 MW and above for projects connected to intra-state transmission systems, and 50 MW and above for projects connected to inter-state transmission systems. The rated power capacity of one resource (wind or solar) must be at least 33% of the total contracted capacity. The solar and wind projects of the hybrid project may be located at the same or different locations. Storage may be added to the hybrid power project to reduce the variability of output power, provide higher energy output, or ensure firm power availability for a particular period.

### Key Provisions:

* Solar and wind projects can be located at the same or different sites.
* Storage can be added to reduce output variability, increase energy output, or ensure firm power availability.
* The guidelines are binding on procurers, authorized representatives, and intermediary procurers.
* Power procured from these projects can be used to fulfill RPO requirements in proportion to the rated capacity of solar and wind power.
* The guidelines will be detailed in standard bidding documents, including model request for selection, power purchase agreements, and power sale agreements.

In case there are any ongoing bids wherein the last date of bid submission is after the date of notification of these Guidelines, then the bid documents in respect of such bids shall be appropriately modified to bring them in alignment with these Guidelines. The Guidelines will provide a framework for the procurement of power from grid-connected wind-solar hybrid projects, ensuring a transparent and competitive process. The implementation of these Guidelines is expected to promote the growth of renewable energy in the country, reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, and contribute to a sustainable energy future. By following these Guidelines, stakeholders can ensure a smooth and efficient procurement process, ultimately benefiting consumers and the environment.

## Power sector FDI grew at a CAGR of approximately 6% from Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2025

FDI is crucial to India's economic growth and development particularly in capital intensive sectors like construction and power sector. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 100% is permitted in the power sector, under the automatic route. In the power sector, FDI stood at ₹ 119.9 billion in fiscal 2025, as against ₹ 74.7 billion in fiscal 2017, indicating strong momentum in the sector. FDI investments in power sector spiked in fiscal 2024 to ₹ 141.4 billion due to the government's initiatives to promote renewable energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, which led to a surge in investments in solar and wind energy projects, as well as the establishment of new power transmission and distribution infrastructure, making India an attractive destination for foreign investors looking to capitalize on the country's growing energy demands and ambitious renewable energy targets.
