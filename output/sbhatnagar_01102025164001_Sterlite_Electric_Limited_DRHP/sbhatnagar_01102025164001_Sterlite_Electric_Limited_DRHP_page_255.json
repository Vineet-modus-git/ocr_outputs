We have recently introduced MVCC cables for solar sector and have started manufacturing solar cables at our manufacturing facility situated at Haridwar and intend to manufacture and E-beam irradiated cable. According to the CRISIL Report, the demand for cables in the renewables sector, specifically in solar and wind applications, has experienced noteworthy growth in tandem with the global shift towards sustainable energy sources. Due to increased focus on renewable energy by corporate and government alike, the solar as well as wind industry are growing at remarkable pace. Solar power transmission relies on essential components, with solar cables playing a crucial role. These specialized cables are engineered to withstand harsh weather, UV exposure, and high electrical loads, solar cables provide flexibility, durability, and reliability in advancing solar power system development and helps in connecting solar panels to the electrical grid, facilitating the widespread integration of solar power. The market size of solar cables has risen from ₹ 5.9 billion in Fiscal 2019 to ₹ 27.5 billion in Fiscal 2025, and it is anticipated to reach approximately ₹ 50 billion to 55 billion by Fiscal 2030, reflecting a CAGR of approximately 13% to 17% between Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2030. CRISIL Report also expects a surge in solar power capacity additions, reaching 140 GW to 160 GW from Fiscal 2026 to Fiscal 2030 significantly surpassing the 78 GW added between Fiscal 2020 and 2025.
