The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

* The fair values of the quoted mutual funds are based on price quotations at the reporting date.

* The fair values of the unquoted equity instruments, compulsorily convertible debentures and compulsorily convertible preference share have been estimated using a DCF model. The valuation requires management to make certain assumptions about the model inputs, including forecast cash flows, discount rate, credit risk and volatility. The probabilities of the various estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and are used in management's estimate of fair value for these unquoted equity investments, compulsorily convertible debentures and compulsorily convertible preference share.

* The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Foreign exchange forward contracts are valued using valuation techniques, which employs the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing model, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spread between the respective currencies, interest rate curves etc. The fair values of commodity futures contracts are based on price quotations on LME at the reporting date. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy together with a quantitative sensitivity analysis as at 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 are as shown below:

**Description of significant unobservable inputs to valuation:**

**A. Discontinued Operations**

**A FVTPL assets - unquoted compulsorily convertible debentures of joint ventures and compulsorily convertible preference share of joint ventures**

The fair value of the investments in compulsorily convertible debentures of joint ventures have been determined based on the fair values of the various transmission projects constructed by the respective joint ventures. Such fair values have been computed based on discounted cash flow (DCF) method during the year ended March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.
