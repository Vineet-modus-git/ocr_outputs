* MSI services. We provide grid uprate and upgrade solutions, helping utilities improve their existing infrastructure with minimal downtime. We deliver end-to-end transmission-line uprating solutions through our portfolio of High Performance (“HP”), GAP and ACCC conductors, engineered for 66 kV to 400 kV applications. Through live-line execution, we expand capacity without additional right-of-way or circuit outages, thereby strengthening grid reliability. We also have experience with up to 96F OPGW installation and have delivered services across various terrains in India, from the northern hilly regions to densely populated southern states and the diverse northeast regions. We utilize turnkey live-line fiberization solutions using drones, establishing us as a provider for transmission corridor upgrades and uprates in India. Through these technology interventions, we are focused on solving the complex energy delivery challenges at the intersection of time, space and capital. We have successfully completed a live-line reconductoring project in Bengaluru, where a 66 kV transmission line was uprated without any shutdown of the conductor. As of March 31, 2025, we have executed 69 projects in India. Our revenue from MSI services increased from ₹ 7,967.30 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 8,620.41 million in Fiscal 2025, at a CAGR of 4.01%.

We also provide convergence services, integrating power and telecom solutions. We leverage existing infrastructure such as OPGW and underground fiber cables to offer advanced communication services. We replace earth-wire to OPGW, upgrade existing fibres and install new fibres with a motive to monetise the fibres.

## 2. Strategically located manufacturing facilities coupled with control over the value chain and research and development capabilities

We have established multiple manufacturing facilities across India to cater to the growing demand for our products, ensuring proximity to key raw material sources and major transportation hubs, including seaports. This geographic advantage reduces logistical costs and enables faster delivery timelines to both domestic and international customers, while also mitigating force-majeure disruptions by allowing quick rerouting through multiple nearby ports and road corridors. Our manufacturing facilities in Jharsuguda (Odisha), Piparia (Dadra and Nagar Haveli)
