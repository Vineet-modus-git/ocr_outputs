## National Green hydrogen Mission

The National Green Hydrogen Mission is a comprehensive initiative launched by the Indian government to promote the production, use, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives, with the aim of establishing India as a global hub in this sector. The mission is a key component of India's clean energy transition strategy, seeking to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and promote sustainable economic growth.

### Key Features of the Scheme:

* The SIGHT program, a major financial initiative under the mission, has a budget of ₹174.90 billion

* ₹ 44.40 billion allocated for domestic manufacturing of electrolysers and ₹ 130.50 billion for green hydrogen production

* Waiver of interstate transmission charges for renewable energy used in green hydrogen production

* Simplified procedures, favorable taxation, and single-window clearances for green hydrogen projects

* Exemption from environmental clearance requirements for green hydrogen and ammonia plants

* Waiver of interstate transmission system charges for 25 years for green hydrogen and green ammonia production units using renewable energy

### Objectives of the Government:

* To establish India as a global hub for the production, use, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives

* To promote a clean energy transition and reduce dependence on fossil fuels

* To support India's goal of becoming self-reliant through renewable energy

* To create a domestic manufacturing ecosystem for green hydrogen and related technologies

* To reduce the cost of green hydrogen and make it viable for use in emerging sectors

* To achieve scale and sustainability in the production of green hydrogen and its derivatives, and to make India a leader in the global clean energy market.

## The Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022” (LPS Rules) and amendment

In June 2022, the Ministry of Power introduced the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, with the aim of addressing the cash flow challenges faced by generation companies and transmission companies in the power sector. The rules provided a mechanism for the settlement of outstanding dues of generating companies, inter-state transmission licensees, and electricity trading licensees. The key features of the rules included the clubbing of all outstanding dues into a consolidated amount, which could be paid in interest-free equated monthly installments (EMIs) over a maximum period of 48 months. The rules also specified penalties for non-payment of dues and modalities for implementation.

Despite the introduction of the 2022 rules, some power generators were not offering their surplus power in the market, resulting in unused power capacity at the national level. This led to a situation where some distribution companies were facing power shortages, while others had surplus power that was not being utilized. To address this issue and optimize the use of available power, the Government of India decided to amend the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022.

## Amendments to the Rules in March 2024

In March 2024, the Government of India amended the Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, to ensure adequate supply of electricity to meet the growing demand in the country. The key amendments made to the rules include:
