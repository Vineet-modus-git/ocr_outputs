### Criminal litigation against our Promoters

1. Pursuant to SEBI's order dated April 19, 2001, prohibited Sterlite Industries India Limited from accessing the capital markets for a period of two years and ordered prosecution proceedings against Sterlite Industries India Limited, through its directors, including Anil Agarwal, our Individual Promoter. SEBI filed a criminal complaint against Sterlite Industries India Limited (now merged with Vedanta Limited, one of our Group Company) and our Individual Promoter, Anil Agarwal and others before the Additional Metropolitan Magistrate, Esplanade in relation to the alleged violation of Regulations 4(a) and 4(d) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 1995. Vedanta Limited filed a criminal application before the Bombay High Court to stay the criminal proceedings initiated by SEBI through its criminal complaint. The Bombay High Court subsequently admitted the application and granted an interim stay on the criminal proceedings. For details, see, "Certain regulatory matters involving our Group Companies - Vedanta Limited" on page 474.

2. Ajaykumar Padia ("Complainant") filed a petition against Bharat Aluminium Company Limited, one of our Group Companies, our Individual Promoter, Anil Agarwal, and others (collectively, "Accused") before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Pune ("CJM") for alleged offences under Sections 420, 34, 406 read with Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The Complainant alleged, inter alia, that the Accused have abated, cheated and committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the deposit, commission and discount offered to the Complainant for the defective goods supplied by the Accused and caused wrongful loss to the Complainant. The CJM, inter alia, ordered investigation into the matter under Section 153(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Pursuant to the investigation, the police investigated the matter and concluded, inter alia, that the concerned matter is of a civil nature ("Report"). Thereafter, the Complainant approached the CJM, questioning the police report and subsequently, the CJM vide an order observed that the Accused acted with dishonest intention and therefore issued process against the Accused under Sections 420, 406 read with Section 34 of the IPC ("Impugned Order"). Aggrieved by the Impugned Order, our Individual Promoter, Anil Agarwal, and others filed a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature for Bombay ("High Court"). The High Court observed, inter alia, that an alternative remedy is available before the sessions court and disposed the petition. Pursuant to the order of the High Court, our Individual Promoter, Anil Agarwal and others filed a criminal revision application before the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Pune ("Sessions Judge"). The Sessions Judge ruled against the Accused and upheld the Impugned Order. Subsequently, our Individual Promoter, Anil Agarwal and others filed a criminal application before the High Court. The High Court granted a stay on the trial court proceedings. The matter is currently pending.
