These conductors offer a balance of strength, conductivity, and corrosion resistance, outperforming traditional aluminium conductors like AAC in specific scenarios.</td><td><strong>Renewable Energy Integration:</strong> Employed in solar and wind farm connections to handle high current loads with minimal losses.<br/><strong>Industrial Power Distribution:</strong> Ideal for industrial settings requiring reliable, high-capacity conductors for heavy machinery and equipment.</td></tr><tr><td>HPC - High Performance conductors</td><td>Specialised</td><td>HPCs are stranded conductors combining annealed aluminium or aluminium alloy wires for conductivity with a reinforced core (often steel or composite materials) for mechanical strength. They are designed for continuous operation at temperatures above 150°C, maintaining stable electrical and mechanical properties under high thermal loads. HPCs offer enhanced current-carrying capacity and durability compared to conventional conductors.</td><td><strong>High-Load Transmission Networks:</strong> Used in transmission lines where high current demands and elevated operating temperatures are common, such as in densely populated regions.<br/><strong>Grid Upgrades:</strong> Applied in reconductoring projects to increase capacity without replacing existing infrastructure, leveraging their high ampacity and thermal stability.<br/><strong>Industrial and Mining Applications:</strong> Suitable for powering heavy industrial equipment and mining operations where sustained high currents are required.</td></tr><tr><td>HTLS - High Temperature Low Sag Conductors</td><td>Specialised</td><td>HTLS conductors, such as Aluminium Conductor Alloy Reinforced (ACAR) or Aluminium Conductor Steel Reinforced (ACSR) variants, are engineered to operate at temperatures up to 250°C or higher. They combine high mechanical strength, thermal stability, and low sag characteristics, allowing them to carry high currents over long distances without excessive drooping. These conductors are ideal for high-voltage transmission lines.</td><td><strong>Long-Distance Power Transmission:</strong> Used in high-voltage transmission lines across vast distances, such as intercity or interstate grids, to minimize losses and sag.<br/><strong>Grid Modernization:</strong> Employed in upgrading aging transmission lines to increase capacity without requiring new towers, thanks to their low sag at high temperatures.<br/><strong>Renewable Energy Evacuation:</strong> Critical for transmitting power from remote renewable energy sources (e.g., wind farms in deserts) to urban centers, handling high currents under extreme conditions.</td></tr><tr><td>Copper conductors</td><td>Conventional</td><td>Copper conductors, made from pure copper or copper alloys, offer excellent electrical conductivity (near 100% IACS), high current-carrying capacity, and low resistance. Their high ductility and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make them suitable for various applications, though they are more expensive than aluminium conductors and may require corrosion protection in certain environments.</td><td><strong>Underground Power Cables:</strong> Widely used in underground distribution systems for urban areas due to their high conductivity and durability in confined spaces.<br/><strong>Substation and Transformer Connections:</strong> Employed in substations and transformers where high current capacity and reliability are critical.<br/><strong>High-Precision Industrial Applications:</strong> Used in industries requiring minimal voltage drop, such as data centers, EV charging infrastructure, and heavy machinery.</td></tr></table>"}, {"bbox": [192, 1260, 492, 1295], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: Crisil Intelligence"}, {"bbox": [192, 1313, 1461, 1415], "category": "Text", "text": "The global conductors market stood at USD 36 billion in 2024, growing with a CAGR of 4.4% from 2019 to 2024.
