The project was initiated in 2012 by the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL), which conducted a study to identify the need for dedicated transmission infrastructure for renewable energy (RE) sources. The study found that the power evacuation and transmission infrastructure in the vicinity of potential RE sites was inadequate, leading to the planning of dedicated transmission infrastructure for large-scale solar and wind power plants. The objective of the GEC project is to ensure the smooth integration of RE into the national grid by providing accurate forecasting, real-time monitoring, and efficient scheduling of RE."}, {"bbox": [191, 579, 435, 615], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Key Characteristics"}, {"bbox": [191, 632, 1459, 925], "category": "Text", "text": "The GEC project comprises of both Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) and Intra-State Transmission System (InSTS), along with the establishment of Renewable Energy Management Centres (REMCs) and other control supporting infrastructure such as reactive power compensation and energy storage systems.
