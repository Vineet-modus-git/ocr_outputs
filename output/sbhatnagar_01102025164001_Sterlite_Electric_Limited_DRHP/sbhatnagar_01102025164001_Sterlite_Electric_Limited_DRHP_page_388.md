(a) Performance obligations

Information about the company's performance obligations are summarised below:

Revenue from sale of conductors, power cables and traded goods

The performance obligation is satisfied upon delivery of conductor, power cable or traded aluminium ingots and rods and payment is generally due within 30 to 180 days from delivery. Some contracts provide the group right to receive price variation from customers on account of changes in metal prices.

Revenue from Engineering, Procurement and Construction ('EPC') contracts

The performance obligation is satisfied progressively over the construction period. The Group's progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion that the contract expenses incurred to date bear to the estimated total contract expenses. Payment is due as per the contractual terms.

Revenue from IRU/ARC contracts:

The performance obligation is satisfied over the contract period as the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised on a straight line over the contract period. Maintenance charges income is recognised over time and is billed to the customer on a monthly/quarterly basis.

The Group is undertaking a project awarded by Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority ("GMDA") to a consortium of which the Group is a party which involves laying of four ducts for creation of Optical Fibre cable backbone network for Gurugram smart city as per the designs approved by GMDA ('Network Infrastructure'). Network Infrastructure shall be in the ownership of GMDA; Out of the four ducts, the Group will be given right of use of two ducts for monetizing its investments. One duct along with Optical Fibre Cable shall be used solely by GMDA and one duct will be spare and will be in the custody of GMDA, revenue earned out of the said duct shall be shared between GMDA and the consortium. The Group shall also undertake maintenance of the above Network Infrastructure for a period of 21 years on its own cost.

The consideration for the development of Network Infrastructure for GMDA's use and for the maintenance of the same for 21 years will be in the form of Right of Way ('ROW') for the above project given by GMDA and no cash consideration will be received from GMDA. For the two ducts for which the rights of use/monetisation will be with the Group, there will be no restrictions from GMDA on the customers or the pricing to be charged by the Group. The Group has valued the consideration in the form of ROW at fair value. The performance obligations consist of development of infrastructure for GMDA (other than two ducts for which monetisation rights are with the Group) and maintenance of the same for 21 years. These performance obligations are considered to be satisfied over time.
