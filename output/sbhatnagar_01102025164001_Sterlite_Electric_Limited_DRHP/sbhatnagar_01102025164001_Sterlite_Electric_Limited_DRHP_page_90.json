These assumptions and estimates include standard capacity calculation practice in the industry in which we operate and capacity of other ancillary equipment installed at the relevant manufacturing facility. Installed capacity is calculated by multiplying the average number of machines in operation by the maximum hourly output of each machine, then by 28 working days per month and by 12 months per year.
