The 'Make in India' initiative was designed to transform India into a global hub for design and manufacturing. Its core objectives were to facilitate investment, encourage innovation, and develop world-class infrastructure. As one of the pioneering 'Vocal for Local' initiatives, it sought not only to boost India's manufacturing capabilities but also to showcase its industrial potential on a global stage.</td></tr><tr><td>National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP)</td><td>The National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP) is a transformative initiative launched to develop world-class industrial infrastructure and promote planned urbanisation across India. By integrating smart technologies and multi-modal connectivity, the programme aims to create globally competitive manufacturing hubs while fostering economic growth and employment opportunities. These industrial corridors are being developed in collaboration with State Governments to ensure efficient planning and execution. In August 2024, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved 12 new industrial areas across 10 states under NICDP with an investment of Rs. 286.02 billion. These industrial nodes, planned along six major corridors, is expected to strengthen India's manufacturing ecosystem and boost its global competitiveness.</td></tr><tr><td>PM Gati Shakti</td><td>In 2021, the Prime Minister launched PM Gati Shakti - National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity, essentially a digital platform to bring 16 Ministries including Railways and Roadways together for integrated planning and coordinated implementation of infrastructure connectivity projects. It will incorporate the infrastructure schemes of various Ministries and State Governments like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, UDAN etc. Economic Zones like textile clusters, pharmaceutical clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters, Agri zones will be covered, and technology will be leveraged including spatial planning tools with ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) imagery developed by BiSAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics).</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [265, 1743, 1389, 2137], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><tr><td>Production linked incentive (PLI) scheme</td><td>Research Organisation) imagery developed by BiSAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics).<br/>This multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for movement of people, goods and services from one mode of transport to another.
