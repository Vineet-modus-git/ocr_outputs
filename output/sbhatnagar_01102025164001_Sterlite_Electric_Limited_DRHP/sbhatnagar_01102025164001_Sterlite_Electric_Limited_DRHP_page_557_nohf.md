18. The Board—

(a) may, if it thinks fit and subject to the provisions of the Act, agree to and receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him; and

(b) upon all or any of the monies so advanced, may (until the same would, but for such advance, become presently payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding, unless the company in general meeting shall otherwise direct, twelve per cent per annum, as may be agreed upon between the Board and the member paying the sum in advance. Nothing contained in this Article shall confer on the Member (i) any right to participate in profits or dividends; or (ii) any voting rights in respect of the moneys so paid by him, until the same would, but for such payment, become presently payable by him, as may be applicable.

Transfer of shares

19. (i) The instrument of transfer of any share in the company shall be executed by or on behalf of both the transferor and transferee.

(ii) The transferor shall be deemed to remain a holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof.

(iii) The instrument of transfer is in the common form as prescribed in Rules made under sub section (1) of Section 56.

20. The Board may, subject to the right of appeal conferred by section 58 of the Act decline to register—

(a) the transfer of a share, not being a fully paid share, to a person of whom they do not approve; or

(b) any transfer of shares on which the company has a lien.

21. The instrument of transfer of any share shall be in writing and all the provisions of Section 56 of the Act, and of any statutory modification thereof for the time being shall be duly complied with in respect of all transfer of shares and registration thereof. The Company shall use the form of transfer, as prescribed under the Act, in all cases. In case of transfer of shares, where the Company has not issued any certificates and where the shares are held in dematerialized form, the provisions of the Depositories Act shall apply. The Board may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless—

(a) the instrument of transfer is in the form as prescribed in rules made under sub-section (1) of section 56 of the Act;

(b) the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the certificate of the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; and

(c) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares.

(d) In case of transfer of shares where the Company has not issued any certificates and where the shares are held in dematerialized form, the provisions of the Depositories Act shall apply.

Provided that the registration of transfer of any securities shall not be refused on the ground of the transferor being alone or jointly with any other person or persons, indebted to the Company on any account. Transfer of shares/debentures in whatever lot shall not be refused.

22. On giving not less than seven days' previous notice in accordance with section 91 of the Act and rules made thereunder, the registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine:

Provided that such registration shall not be suspended for more than thirty days at any one time or for more than forty-five days in the aggregate in any year.

22A. Subject to the provisions of these Articles and other applicable provisions of the Act or any other law for the time being in force, the Board may (at its own absolute and uncontrolled discretion) decline or refuse by giving reasons, whether in pursuance of any power of the Company under these Articles or otherwise, to register or acknowledge any transfer of, or the transmission by operation of law of the right to, any securities or interest of a member in the Company, after providing sufficient cause, within a period of thirty days from the date on which the instrument of transfer, or the intimation of such transmission, as the case may be and as may be applicable, was delivered to the Company. Provided that the registration of transfer of any securities shall not be refused on the ground of the transferor being alone or jointly with any other person or persons, indebted to the Company on any account. Transfer of shares/debentures in whatever lot shall not be refused.
