**70. Investors may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of income arising on the sale of the Equity Shares.**

Under current Indian tax laws and regulations, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares in an Indian company are generally taxable in India. Additionally, a securities transaction tax ("STT") is levied on equity shares sold on an Indian stock exchange.

Any capital gain exceeding ₹125,000, realised on the sale of listed equity shares on a recognised stock exchange held for more than 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer will be subject to long term capital gains in India.

At the rate of 12.5% (plus applicable surcharge and cess). This beneficial rate, is among others, subject to payment of STT.

Further, any gain realised on the sale of equity shares in an Indian company held for more than 12 months, which are sold using any platform other a recognised stock exchange and on which no STT has been paid, will be subject to long term capital gains tax in India at the rate of 12.5% (plus applicable surcharge and cess). Further, any capital gains realized on the sale of listed equity shares held for a period of 12 months or less immediately preceding the date of transfer will be subject to short-term capital gains tax in India. Such gains will be subject to tax at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess), subject to STT being paid at the time of sale of such shares. Otherwise, such gains will be taxed at the applicable rates.

While non-residents may claim tax treaty benefits in relation to such capital gains income, generally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India's right to impose tax on capital gains arising from the sale of shares of an Indian company.

The stamp duty for transfer of certain securities, other than debentures, on a delivery basis is currently specified at 0.015% and on a non-delivery basis is specified at 0.003% of the consideration amount.

Recently, the Government of India has notified the ITA 2025, to repeal and replace the IT Act, with effect from April 1, 2026. While the Government has stated that ITA 2025 does not introduce any policy changes and has primarily been enacted as a simplified, concise, and reader-friendly legislation, we cannot predict whether such simplification or changes in legislative language may give rise to interpretational issues. We cannot predict if the enactment of the ITA 2025 or any interpretational issue arising therefrom will have a bearing on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations or in the industry in which we operate.

Unfavourable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations including foreign investment and stamp duty laws governing our business and operations could result in us being deemed to be in contravention of such laws and may require us to apply for additional approvals.

**71. Investors will not be able to sell immediately on an Indian stock exchange any of the Equity Shares they purchase in the Offer.**

The Equity Shares will be listed on the Stock Exchanges. Pursuant to applicable Indian laws, certain actions must be completed before the Equity Shares can be listed and trading in the Equity Shares may commence. The Allotment and transfer of Equity Shares in this Offer and the credit of such Equity Shares to the applicant's demat account with depository participant could take approximately two Working Days from the Bid Closing Date and trading in the Equity Shares upon receipt of final listing and trading approvals from the Stock Exchanges is expected to commence within three Working Days of the Bid Closing Date. There could be a failure or delay in the listing of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges. Any failure or delay in obtaining the approval or otherwise any delay in commencing trading in the Equity Shares would restrict investors' ability to dispose of their Equity Shares. There can be no assurance that the Equity Shares will be credited to investors' demat accounts, or that trading in the Equity Shares will commence, within the time periods specified in this risk factor. We could also be required to pay interest at the applicable rates if allotment is not made, refund orders are not dispatched or demat credits are not made to investors within the prescribed time periods.

**72. Any future issuance of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity linked instruments by us may dilute your shareholding and sale of Equity Shares by shareholders with significant shareholding may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.**

We may be required to finance our growth through future equity offerings. Any future equity issuances by us, including a primary offering of Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to Equity Shares, may lead to the dilution of investors' shareholdings in our Company. Any future equity issuances by us or sales of our Equity Shares by our shareholders
