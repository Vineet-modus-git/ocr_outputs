railways, defence and industrial are driven by digital transformation and adoption of new age technologies. These factors directly contribute to demand for OPGW cable as the cable can support fiber infrastructure expansion with minimal or no additional RoW costs of since it utilizes the existing power grid infrastructure.

Furthermore, the Indian government's initiatives, such as the "Smart Grid" and "Digital India" programs, have also contributed to the growth of the OPGW cables industry, as these initiatives emphasize the need for efficient and reliable power transmission and communication systems, thereby creating a favorable business environment for OPGW cable manufacturers and suppliers in the country.

## Overview of convergence services

Convergence refers to the integration of power utility infrastructure and telecommunications networks to provide reliable and efficient connectivity. This concept enables the sharing of existing infrastructure, such as transmission and distribution towers, substations, and Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) networks, between power utilities and telecommunications service providers. By leveraging these shared resources, telecommunications companies can deliver high-quality connectivity services to a wider audience, while power utilities can generate additional revenue streams.

The convergence of power and telecommunications infrastructure offers numerous benefits, including improved network reliability, reduced costs, and increased efficiency. Usage of OPGW cables provides opportunities for transmission companies and telecom players to engage together. Convergence services enable power utility infrastructure, such as transmission towers and substations, to be shared with telecommunications companies, providing reliable connectivity nationwide. For instance, Maharashtra Transmission Communication Infrastructure Ltd (MTCIL), a joint venture between Sterlite Power and Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company (MSETCL), has established an OPGW network across Maharashtra. This network supports MSETCL's operations, including voice and data communication, remote monitoring, and asset management, but also offers excess fibre capacity to telecom providers. The network's ring architecture connects major cities, serving over 35 customers, including major telcos and ISPs. Additionally, a dedicated OPGW corridor has been built in Mumbai, home to many major data centers, to provide low-latency connectivity to telecom service providers, enhancing their network performance and supporting the needs of OTT and enterprise customers.

Convergence services also include co-location services, which provide secure and reliable data center facilities with uninterrupted power supply and backup systems. The convergence of power and telecommunications infrastructure has also led to innovative public-private partnerships (PPPs) around the world. For example, governments and private companies are collaborating to develop smart city initiatives, which rely on the integration of power and telecommunications infrastructure to provide efficient and sustainable services to citizens. The growth of the convergence services is expected to be driven by increasing demand for high-speed data connectivity, government initiatives, and technological advancements, which will enable the delivery of high-quality, reliable, and efficient connectivity services to a wider audience. This growth will be further fueled by the rising need for smart city infrastructure and sustainable energy solutions.

## Overview of E-beam irradiated cables

Electron beam processing is a technology that has a wide range of commercial, medical, and industrial applications. It modifies materials' properties and improves their performance. The technology is used to sterilize medical devices, and enhance wire and cable insulation. The process is energy-efficient, fast, and doesn't require additives or generate hazardous by-products. Electron beam cross-linking is used to improve wire and cable insulation, and it increases their strength, thermal resistance, and protects them from heat.

Electron beam accelerators are used to generate electrons in the range of 0.1 to 100 MeV energy range. The technology is widely used in various industries, including plastics, automotive, wire and cable, semiconductors, healthcare, aerospace, and environmental. The electron beam cross-linking of wire insulation and cable jackets is done with electron energies in the range of 500 keV to 1.5 MeV. By crosslinking, polymer chains are linked together by so-called cross links. A three-dimensional polymer network is created where the molecules have been joined together into a new non-meltable polymer system. Now, the polymer chains lose some of their ability to move as individual chains. The result is no melting. The process improves wire and cable properties, including tensile strength, thermal resistance, and flame propagation resistance. It also increases shear and compressive strength of wires and cables.

E-beam cables offer several advantages over chemically cross-linked cables. They have a higher degree of crosslinking, up to 75 to 80%, compared to 50 to 55% in chemically cross-linked cables. Additionally, E-beam crosslinking occurs at room temperature, eliminating polymer degradation caused by high temperatures. This process also prevents oxidative degradation, which can occur due to leftover chemicals, oxygen, and operating temperatures.
