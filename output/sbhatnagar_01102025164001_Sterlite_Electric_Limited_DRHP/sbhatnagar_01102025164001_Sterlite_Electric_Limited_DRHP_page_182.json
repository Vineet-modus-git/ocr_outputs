Under the National Electric Mobility Mission plan, the government plans to promote EV adoption and expand charging infrastructure across major cities. The Union Budget 2019 to 2020 allocated ₹ 10 billion for building a nationwide EV charging infrastructure, with plans to install charging stations every 25 km on major highways. Several states, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka, have announced favorable policies to boost EV adoption. As a result, EV charging demand is expected to contribute to power demand, with Crisil Intelligence projecting an addition of up to 35 billion units (BUs) of power demand between fiscal 2026 and 2030, averaging 8.5 to 9.5 BUs per year."}, {"bbox": [191, 470, 648, 508], "category": "Caption", "text": "### EV Sales (Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2026P)"}, {"bbox": [203, 523, 1443, 919], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [191, 947, 411, 982], "category": "Text", "text": "*Note: P: Projected*"}, {"bbox": [191, 982, 682, 1015], "category": "Text", "text": "*Source: Vahan, Industry, Crisil Intelligence*"}, {"bbox": [191, 1064, 1461, 1231], "category": "Text", "text": "Electric passenger vehicle (EV) penetration in India is projected to increase to 4.5 to 5% in fiscal 2026, compared to 2.6% in fiscal 2025.
