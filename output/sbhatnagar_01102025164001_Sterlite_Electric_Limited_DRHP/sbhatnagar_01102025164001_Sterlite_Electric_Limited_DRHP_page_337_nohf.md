(b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary and the parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary. Business combinations policy explains how to account for any related goodwill.

(c) Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements. Ind AS-12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions.

(d) Non-controlling interest in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated changes of statement of equity and balance sheet respectively.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

* Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost

* Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests

* Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity

* Recognises the fair value of the consideration received

* Recognises the fair value of any investment retained (unless the subsidiary is considered as an asset rather than a business and the investment retained is classified as investment in associate or joint venture in which case the investment retained is carried at cost)

* Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss

* Reclassifies the parent's share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
