## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest risk. Our senior management oversees the management of these risks. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is our policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. We review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.

Our risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by us, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and our activities.

Our management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of our risk management framework.

## Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.

### (i) Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rate primarily relates to our long term debt obligations with floating interest rates. We are exposed to the interest rate fluctuation in both domestic and foreign currency borrowing.

### (ii) Interest Rate Sensitivity

Interest rate sensitivity is the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates on the portion of loans and borrowings affected.

### (iii) Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to our operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and foreign currency borrowings.

We have a policy to keep minimum forex exposure on the books that are likely to occur within a maximum 12-month period for hedges of forecasted sales and purchases.

When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, we negotiate the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure. For hedges of forecast transactions the derivatives cover the period of exposure from the point the cash flows of the transactions are forecasted up to the point of settlement of the resulting receivable or payable that is denominated in the foreign currency.

### (iv) Foreign Currency Sensitivity

Foreign currency sensitivity is the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and EUR exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on our profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. The impact on our profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. Our exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
