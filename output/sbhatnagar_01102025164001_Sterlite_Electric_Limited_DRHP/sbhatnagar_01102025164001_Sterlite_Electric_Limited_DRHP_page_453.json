Our primary raw materials and components we use are aluminium for our conductors and aluminium, copper and PVC compounds for cables. We source our primary raw materials from both domestic and international third-party manufacturers who meet our quality standards and those of our customers, and who can fulfil our volume requirements. While we are not significantly dependent on any single raw material supplier, raw material supply and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including global demand and supply, geo-politics, import duties, tariffs, general economic and political conditions, transportation and labour costs, labour unrest, natural disasters, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange rates, and there are inherent uncertainties in estimating such variables, regardless of the methodologies and assumptions that we may use. In order to mitigate the raw material sourcing risks, we have a strong supplier network spread across geographies. Given that we import some of our raw materials, our raw material procurement is subject to global supply and demand, as well as global shipping and logistics dynamics. It is possible that we could be exposed to global shortages of materials or delays in the delivery of materials. We are also dependent on supplied raw materials being of high quality and meeting relevant technical specifications and quality standards. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to procure adequate supplies of raw materials in the future, as and when we need them on commercially acceptable terms."}, {"bbox": [142, 794, 1558, 1023], "category": "Text", "text": "Further, the cable and conductor manufacturers rely on globally traded commodities.

Similarly, the price we pay for domestic steel can fluctuate due to volatility in Indian steel prices, though those are quoted in Indian Rupees. Any external disruptions can have impact on the cost and delivery schedules. Over the past few years, numerous global events have impacted the sector and have highlighted the fragility of these supply chains.

However, our sales from exports and a portion of our raw materials expenditures are denominated in foreign currencies, including largely, the United States Dollar (\"USD\"). The exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and these currencies, particularly the USD, has fluctuated in the past and our results of operations have been impacted by such fluctuations and may be impacted by such fluctuations in the future. Depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations by increasing the cost of our raw materials. Volatility in the exchange rate and/or sustained appreciation of the Indian Rupee will negatively impact our revenue and operating results. Further, while we seek to hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts, any steps undertaken to hedge the risks due to fluctuations in currencies may not adequately hedge against any losses we incur due to such fluctuations."}, {"bbox": [145, 1435, 537, 1471], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Competition and pricing pressure"}, {"bbox": [142, 1498, 1558, 1917], "category": "Text", "text": "We operate in a highly competitive environment, both in India and internationally. The industry is fragmented, with a diverse range of competitors, both large multinational companies and smaller regional players. The success of our operations is heavily reliant on our ability to effectively compete. Suppliers in the overhead conductors and cables industry compete based on key attributes including technical competence, product quality, pricing and timely delivery. Some of our competitors may possess greater financial resources and larger manufacturing capacities. Certain competitors may also benefit from cost advantages in their operations or have expertise in manufacturing specific products and have access to certain technologies due to their collaboration and tie-ups with certain international manufacturers. As a result, they may offer a broader product range, larger sales teams, and more extensive intellectual property resources, enabling them to appeal to a wider range of customers across various sectors. Our ability to remain competitive and achieve desired margins is influenced by both domestic and international competition. Increasing competition may result in pricing pressures or decreasing profit margins or lost market share or failure to improve our market position, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.
