All SCSBs offering facility of making application in public issues shall also provide facility to make application using the UPI Mechanism. Our Company has appointed certain of the SCSBs as the Sponsor Bank(s) to act as a conduit between the Stock Exchanges and NPCI in order to facilitate collection of requests and/or payment instructions of the UPI Bidders using the UPI Mechanism.

Pursuant to the UPI Circulars, SEBI has set out specific requirements for redressal of investor grievances for applications that have been made through the UPI Mechanism. The requirements of the UPI Circulars include, appointment of a nodal officer by the SCSB and submission of their details to SEBI, the requirement for SCSBs to send SMS alerts for the blocking and unblocking of UPI mandates, the requirement for the Registrar to submit details of cancelled, withdrawn or deleted applications on a daily basis to the SCSBs, and the requirement for the bank accounts of unsuccessful Bidders to be unblocked no later than one day from the date on which the Basis of Allotment is finalised. Failure to unblock the accounts within the timeline and submit confirmation of the same to the BRLMs and the Registrar to the Offer would result in the SCSBs being penalised under the relevant securities law. Additionally, if there is any delay in the redressal of investors' complaints, the relevant SCSB as well as the post Offer BRLM will be required to compensate the concerned investor.

For further details, refer to the General Information Document available on the websites of the Stock Exchanges and the BRLMs.
