footing and condition that this Article will have full effect, to the extent applicable. Unless otherwise agreed, the registration of transfer of shares / debentures shall operate as a waiver of the Company's lien, if any, on such shares / debentures.

Provided that the Board may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article, to the extent applicable.

The fully paid-up shares shall be free from all lien and in the case of partly paid up shares the Company's lien shall be restricted to moneys called or payable at a fixed time in respect of such shares, as applicable.

10. The company may sell, in such manner as the Board thinks fit, any shares on which the company has a lien: Provided that no sale shall be made—

(a) unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable; or

(b) until the expiration of fourteen days after a notice in writing stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or insolvency.

11. (i) To give effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof.

(ii) The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer.

(iii) The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale.

12. (i) The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable.

(ii) The residue, if any, shall, subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale, be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.

## Calls on shares

13. (i) The Board may, from time to time, make calls upon the Members in respect of any monies unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times:

Provided that no call shall exceed one-fourth of the nominal value of the share or be payable at less than one month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call.

(ii) Each member shall, subject to receiving at least fourteen days' notice specifying the time or times and place of payment, pay to the company, at the time or times and place so specified, the amount called on his shares.

(iii) A call may be revoked or postponed at the discretion of the Board.

(iv) The power to call on shares shall not be delegated to any other person except with the approval of the shareholders' in a general meeting and as may be permitted by law.

15. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.

16. (i) If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest thereon from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at ten percent. per annum or at such lower rate, if any, as the Board may determine.

(ii) The Board shall be at liberty to waive payment of any such interest wholly or in part.

17. (i) Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall, for the purposes of these regulations, be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue such sum becomes payable.

(ii) In case of non-payment of such sum, all the relevant provisions of these regulations as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.
