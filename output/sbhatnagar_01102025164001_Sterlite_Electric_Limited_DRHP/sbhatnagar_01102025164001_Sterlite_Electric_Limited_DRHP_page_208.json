Essentially, OPGW cables are designed to serve as a ground wire for high-voltage transmission lines, providing a path to ground for fault current and protecting the transmission line from lightning strikes and other electrical surges. OPGW cables are strung above HV lines. Another key function of the OPGW cable is to serve as a high bandwidth fiber backbone running along the length of the transmission corridor. Its added benefit of containing optical fiber can be used for telecommunication purposes. OPGW provides dual benefit to transmission companies - safeguarding the infra via earthing and providing additional revenue at a substantially lower capex."}, {"bbox": [193, 1768, 1459, 1995], "category": "Text", "text": "As the Indian government aims to achieve its ambitious targets of increasing power generation capacity and ensuring reliable transmission, the demand for OPGW cables has been on the rise. These cables, which combine the functions of a ground wire and an optical fiber cable, have become an essential component in the construction of high-voltage transmission lines, offering a reliable and efficient means of transmitting data and protecting against power outages. With several major players, including domestic manufacturers and international companies, operating in the Indian market, the industry has become increasingly competitive, driving innovation and advancements in technology."}, {"bbox": [193, 2014, 1459, 2176], "category": "Text", "text": "The Optical Fiber Network in India is driven by the National Broadband Mission's target to fiberise 70% of India's base transceiver stations (BTS) as an ideal requirement for the efficient rollout of 5G services.
