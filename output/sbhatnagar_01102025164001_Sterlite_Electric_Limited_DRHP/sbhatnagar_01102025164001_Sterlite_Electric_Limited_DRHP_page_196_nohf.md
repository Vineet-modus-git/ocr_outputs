step-down transformers. In the final leg of the chain, medium voltage and low voltage are used to transmit power from the sub-transmission point to the end consumer.

Power conductors and cables are used for the bulk transfer of electrical energy from generating power plants to sub-stations and thereon for distribution to end consumers. While bare conductors are largely used for the transmission of power, power cables are used in the sub-transmission and distribution segment

The table highlights the key differences between cables and conductors across various parameters, including definition, insulation, current carrying capacity, cost, durability, and signal integrity.

## Introduction to electrical wires and cables

Wires consist of single conductor and cables are assembly of one or more conductors that are used for the transmission of electricity, data or signals. There are various types and varieties of cables, each designed to perform a specific function. Classification is based on the core structure of the conductor metal (majorly copper and aluminium), number of cores, type of insulation material and arrangement, etc.

Power and electrical cables are segmented into the following, based on voltage capacity:

* Low Tension / Voltage (LV) [1.1 kV and below]
* Medium Voltage (MV) [above 1.1KV to 33 KV]
* High Tension / Voltage (HV) [above 33 KV]
* Extra High voltage (EHV) [66 kV and above] cables

Major uses of power cables are in the power sector (central, state and private electricity utilities) and sectors like petrochemicals, mining, steel, non-ferrous, shipbuilding, cement, railway, defence, Datacentres, etc.

The performance and durability of cables depend on the quality of raw materials. Specialised applications require superior chemical, mechanical, thermal and electrical performance from cables, resulting in usage of high-performance materials in cable construction. Additionally, it is seen that in order to achieve properties suited for varying applications, every cable has a distinguished construction. The number of SKUs of cables and wires are very high, with 500 to 600 fastest selling SKUs, differing in application and offering variation in cross-sectional area (size), number of cores used, core material (mainly copper or aluminium), insulation material used, armoured or unarmoured construction for strength, etc.
