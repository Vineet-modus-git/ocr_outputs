Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss:

* Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and
* Net interest expense or income

Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee benefit. The group measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The group recognizes expected cost of short-term employee benefit as an expense, when an employee renders the related service.

The group treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes. Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the reporting date. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken to the statement of profit and loss and are not deferred. The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Share based payments

The Group issues equity-settled options to certain employees. These are measured at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share-based options is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured using Black-Scholes framework and is recognized as an expense, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the options vest using the graded vesting method. The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The expected volatility and forfeiture assumptions are based on historical information.

The dilutive effect of outstanding options if any, is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

## Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entities and a financial liability or equity instruments of another entity.

### Financial assets

#### Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under Ind AS 115.

For a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)' on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.

The Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets to generate cash flows.
