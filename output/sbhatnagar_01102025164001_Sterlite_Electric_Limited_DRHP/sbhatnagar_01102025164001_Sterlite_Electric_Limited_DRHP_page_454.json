Projects in this sector are primarily undertaken or awarded by governmental authorities and entities funded by the central and state Governments. We currently derive and, in the future expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from power generation, transmission and distribution projects in India which are dependent on budgetary allocations made by central and state Governments, public bodies as well as increasing access through private sector funding. We believe that sustained increase in budgetary allocation for and the participation of public bodies, coupled with comprehensive policies that encourage greater private sector participation and funding will result in the growth of this sector. Macroeconomic factors such as rising power demand for residential, industrial and commercial purposes, increased usage of electricity in rural economy, higher focus on renewable energy and related governmental policies thereof, will have a significant impact on our prospects and results of operations. Furthermore, broader economic indicators such as GDP growth, foreign investment regulations, oil and commodity prices, interest rates, tariffs, access to capital, export market regulations and overall financial stability may significantly influence the economic landscape of the country, and by extension, the viability and scale of investment in power transmission and distribution. A change in policy resulting from a change in government (including change in central government and/or state governments of regions where our projects are located) may also impact our business. These shifts could affect project approvals, funding mechanisms, and strategic priorities in the power generation, transmission and distribution sector."}, {"bbox": [144, 986, 599, 1021], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**Presentation of Financial Information**"}, {"bbox": [144, 1050, 1558, 1436], "category": "Text", "text": "The Restated Consolidated Financial Information of our Company comprises the and its Subsidiaries, (the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”), its joint ventures and associate, comprises the Restated Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as at March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 and the Restated Consolidated Statements of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Restated Consolidated Summary Cash Flow Statements and the Restated Consolidated Summary Statement of Changes in Equity, the summary statement of Material Accounting policies and other explanatory information for each of the financial years ended March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, based on our consolidated financial statements of the Group, its joint ventures and associate as at and for each of the years ended March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 prepared in accordance with Ind AS notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and restated by our Company in accordance with requirements of Section 26 of Part I of Chapter III of the Companies Act, 2013, Paragraph (A) of Clause 11 (I) of Part A of Schedule VI of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and the Guidance Note on Reports in Company Prospectuses (Revised 2019) issued by the ICAI as amended from time to time."}, {"bbox": [144, 1466, 1558, 1822], "category": "Text", "text": "Our restated consolidated summary statements of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income) and restated consolidated summary cash flow statements for the years ended March 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025 included in our Restated Consolidated Financial Information, reflect the split between our continuing and discontinued operations.
