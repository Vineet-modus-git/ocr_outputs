For the purpose of identification of material litigation in (iv) above, our Board has considered and adopted the following policy on materiality with regard to such outstanding litigation to be disclosed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus (the "Materiality Policy") by way of a resolution dated September 27, 2025, and following would be considered 'material' in relation to the Relevant Parties if:

(i) The value or expected impact in terms of value of the litigation by or against the Relevant Parties in any such pending proceeding is in excess of ₹ 99.43 million ("Materiality Amount"), being the amount equivalent to 5% of the average of the absolute value of restated profit or restated loss for Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023 of the Company for the continuing operations; or

(ii) Such outstanding litigation where the decision in one litigation is likely to affect the decision in similar litigation, even though the value or expected impact in terms of value in an individual litigation may not exceed the Materiality Amount but where the cumulative value or expected impact in terms of value of such matters exceeds the Materiality Amount specified above; and

(iii) All outstanding litigation which may not meet the Materiality Amount or where the value or expected impact in terms of value of such litigation is not determinable or quantifiable but nonetheless, in the opinion of our Board, directly or indirectly, or together with similar other proceedings, have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, performance or financial condition, reputation, results of operations or cash flows of our Company.

It is clarified that for the above purposes, pre-litigation notices received by Relevant Parties, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management, from third parties (excluding notices issued by statutory or regulatory or governmental or taxation authorities), have not been considered as litigations unless otherwise decided by the Board or until such time that the Relevant Parties, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management, as applicable, are impleaded as a defendant in the litigation proceedings before any judicial/ quasi-judicial or arbitral forum. Further, in the event that the value or expected impact in terms of value of any tax matters exceeds the Materiality Amount specified above in relation to each of the respective Relevant Party, Key Managerial Personnel or Senior Management, as applicable, individual disclosures of such tax matters have been made.
