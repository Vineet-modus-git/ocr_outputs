consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.

### Trade receivables

A receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section "Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement".

### Contract liabilities

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made, or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.

## ii. Other income:

### Dividend

Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss only when the right to receive payment is established, provided it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.

### Interest income

The Group recognises the interest income based on the rate of interest as mentioned in the loan agreement. The Group annually assesses the recoverability of the loan based by reviewing the financial position of the lender and considers the provision on the recoverability based on the such assessment. Interest accrual is considered in the books only if it is considered to be recoverable.

## g) Taxation

### Current income tax

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Current income tax relating to items recognised outside of profit or loss is recognised outside of profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

### Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
