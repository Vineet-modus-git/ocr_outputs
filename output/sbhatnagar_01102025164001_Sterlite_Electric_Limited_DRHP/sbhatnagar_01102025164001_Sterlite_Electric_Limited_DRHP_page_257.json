Designed using a high strength aluminium - Magnesium - Silicon Alloy to achieve a high strength-to-weight ratio; affords optimum sag-tension characteristics, and corrosion resistance when compared with ACSR.</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>All Aluminium Conductors (\"AAC\")</td><td>It is also known as aluminium stranded conductor. It consists of several layers of aluminium wires stranded of hard drawn 1350 aluminum concentrically. AAC conductors are manufactured from electrolytically refined aluminium with a minimum purity of 99.7% and are used in low, medium and high voltage overhead lines.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Aluminium Alloy (\"ACAR\") Conductor reinforced</td><td>It is formed by concentrically stranded wires of Aluminium 1350 and high strength Aluminium-Magnesium-Silicon (\"AIMgSi\") alloy core. The number of wires of each depends on the cable design. The typical design comprises a stranded core of AIMgSi alloy strands but in certain cable constructions, the wires of AIMgSi alloy strands can be in layers throughout the Aluminium 1350 strands.</td></tr></tbody></table>"}]
