33. (i) A duly verified declaration in writing that the declarant is a director, the manager or the secretary, of the company, and that a share in the company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share;
(ii) The company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share on any sale or disposal thereof and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of;
(iii) The transferee shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the share; and
(iv) The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.

34. The provisions of these regulations as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of nonpayment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

## Share Warrants

³³4A. (i) Share warrants may be issued as per the provisions of applicable Law.

(ii) The Board of Directors may in its absolute discretion issue share warrants subject to, and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws.

## Alteration of capital

35. The company may, from time to time, by ordinary resolution increase the share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such amount, as may be specified in the resolution.

36. Subject to the provisions of section 61 of the Act, the company may, by ordinary resolution,—

(a) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares;

(b) convert all or any of its fully paid-up shares into stock, and reconvert that stock into fully paid-up shares of any denomination;

(c) sub-divide its existing shares or any of them into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum, however, that in the sub-division the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced share is derived; and;

(d) cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.

The cancellation of shares under sub-section (d) shall not be deemed to be a reduction of share capital.

37. Where shares are converted into stock,—

(a) the holders of stock may transfer the same or any part thereof in the same manner as, and subject to the same regulations under which, the shares from which the stock arose might before the conversion have been transferred, or as near thereto as circumstances admit:

Provided that the Board may, from time to time, fix the minimum amount of stock transferable, so, however, that such minimum shall not exceed the nominal amount of the shares from which the stock arose.

(b) the holders of stock shall, according to the amount of stock held by them, have the same rights, privileges and advantages as regards dividends, voting at meetings of the company, and other matters, as if they held the shares from which the stock arose; but no such privilege or advantage (except participation in the dividends and profits of the company and in the assets on winding up) shall be conferred by an amount of stock which would not, if existing in shares, have conferred that privilege or advantage.

(c) such of the Articles of the company as are applicable to paid-up shares shall apply to stock and the words "share" and "shareholder" in those regulations shall include "stock" and "stock-holder" respectively.
