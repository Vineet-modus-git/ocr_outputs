As there is a push for renewables in large markets such as USA, China, Europe and India, and the gradual decrease in supply chain pressures, higher capacity additions are expected in solar and wind power sectors going forward. As a result, 2023 investments in global renewables reached USD 735 billion. Moving forward, the investments are estimated to further grow by approximately 5% to reach approximately USD 771 billion by 2024. Factors such as the stabilization of interest rates, ongoing technological advancements, and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy sources are likely to support this continued investment. However, the market may also face challenges, including regulatory uncertainties and the need for further infrastructure development to accommodate the growing share of renewables in the energy mix."}, {"bbox": [192, 1373, 1459, 1535], "category": "Text", "text": "Moving forward, global power sector investments are estimated to rise to USD 1,600 to 1,800 billion by 2030 in STEPS scenario, majorly driven by investments in wind PV, solar PV and grids.
