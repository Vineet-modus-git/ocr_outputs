From around 31% of the total population in 2010, the share of urban residents is projected to rise to nearly 40% by 2030, according to UN reports on urbanisation. Migration can occur in various forms—sometimes involving entire families relocating, and other times only students or earning members moving to urban centres. As this urbanisation trend accelerates, it is expected to drive a marked increase in demand for reliable and high-quality electricity supply to support growing residential, commercial, and industrial activities in cities."}, {"bbox": [191, 832, 1461, 1091], "category": "Text", "text": "Rising urbanisation will also change consumption patterns significantly. Households will increasingly use modern appliances, lighting, and cooling solutions.

In this context, India's power sector is underpinned by a pressing need to expand generation capacity, modernise transmission and distribution networks, and integrate renewable energy to meet the aspirations of a young, rapidly growing population seeking improved living standards and economic productivity.
