ANNEXURE-VI

Notes to the Restated Consolidated Summary Statements

(All amounts in Rupees million unless otherwise stated)

Any goodwill arising in the acquisition/ business combination of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.

e) Fair value measurement

The Group measures financial instruments such as mutual funds and derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

* In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

* In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable;

Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as investments in unquoted equity shares. Involvement of external valuers is decided by the management on a need basis and with relevant approvals. The valuers involved are selected based on criteria like market knowledge, reputation, independence and professional standards. The management decides after discussion with the external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for the valuation.
