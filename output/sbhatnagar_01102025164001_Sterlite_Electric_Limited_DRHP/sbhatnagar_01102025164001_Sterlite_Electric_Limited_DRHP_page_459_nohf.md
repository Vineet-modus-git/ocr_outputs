The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable;

Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as investments in unquoted equity shares. Involvement of external valuers is decided by the management on a need basis and with relevant approvals. The valuers involved are selected based on criteria like market knowledge, reputation, independence and professional standards. The management decides after discussion with the external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for the valuation.

At each reporting date, the management analyses the movement of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or reassessed as per the Group's accounting policies. For this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.

The management in conjunction with the external valuers also compares the change in fair value of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. The valuation results are discussed at the Audit Committee.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained above.

## Revenue recognition

### Revenue from contract with customers

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of goods and service tax (GST).
