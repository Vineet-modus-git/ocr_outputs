## Overview of power sector in India

### Global electricity demand to grow at 3.9% CAGR over Calendar Year 2024 to 2027 with renewable energy supplying approximately 38% by Calendar Year 2027, up from approximately 29% in Calendar Year 2022

The world's electricity consumption is projected to experience its fastest growth in years till 2027, driven by factors such as increasing industrial activity, greater use of air conditioning, rapid electrification, and the global expansion of data centers. After a 4.3% increase in 2024, global electricity demand is expected to continue growing at a rate of nearly 4% until 2027. Over the next three years, the world's electricity consumption is forecast to increase by a significant 3,500 TWh, which is equivalent to adding the entire electricity consumption of Japan to the global total every year. This represents a substantial acceleration from the 2.5% growth seen in 2023, when gains in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asia were offset by declines in more developed economies.

The majority of the world's increased electricity demand until 2027 is anticipated to come from emerging economies, accounting for 85% of the growth. China is currently driving this trend, with a 7% increase in electricity demand in 2024, and is expected to maintain an average annual growth rate of 6% until 2027. Other emerging markets, including India and Southeast Asia, are also expected to experience significant growth, fueled by economic expansion and increasing air conditioner ownership. India's electricity demand is projected to grow at an average rate of 6.3% per year over the next three years, outpacing its previous growth rate. However, despite progress in recent years, many African countries are still struggling to provide reliable electricity access, with 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa remaining without access to a stable power supply.
