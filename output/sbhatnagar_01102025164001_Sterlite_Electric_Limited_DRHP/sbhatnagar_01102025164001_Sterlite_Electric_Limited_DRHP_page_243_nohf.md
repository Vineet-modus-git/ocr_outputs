<table><thead><tr><td>Market drivers</td><td>Details</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Increasing power demand</td><td><ul><li>Power demand is directly linked to GDP. With rising India's GDP coupled with other factors such as urbanization, rise in population, rise in industrial output the power demand is expected to see a growth of 5-7% between fiscal 2025 and 2029.</li><li>In order to meet the rising demand, the power sector is expected to see a capacity addition from 442 GW in fiscal 2024 to 700-710 GW in fiscal 2029. This addition of capacities will further push to increase transmission lines & sub stations of high voltage as well as upgradation of existing transmission lines</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Focus on green energy integration</td><td><ul><li>To achieve its ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, the Indian government has introduced the Green Energy Corridor (GEC) scheme, which aims to integrate electricity generated from renewable sources like wind and solar into the conventional power grid</li><li>Under GEC Phase 1, 24 GW of renewable energy has been integrated into the grid by 2023, with an additional 19.43 GW planned in GEC phase 2 at a cost of Rs 120.3 billion</li><li>Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved to develop 10,750 ckm of transmission lines and 27,500 MVA of sub-stations to support renewable energy growth with commissioned deadline by 2026</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Expansion of transmission lines as well as increasing inter regional transmission capacity</td><td><ul><li>As per the National Electricity Plan, over 1,91,000 ckm of transmission lines and 1270 GVA of transformation capacity is planned to be added during the ten-year period from 2022-23 to 2031-32 (at 220 kV and above voltage level)</li><li>The inter-regional transmission capacity is planned to increase to 143 GW by the year 2027 and further to 168 GW by the year 2032, from the present level of 119 GW</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Technological advancements</td><td><ul><li>The National Electricity Plan (2022-2032) recommends the adoption of cutting-edge technologies in substations, transmission lines, and communication systems, as well as the use of advanced surveying tools and robust cybersecurity measures.</li><li>The integration of these modern technologies is expected to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the transmission network, while also attracting new investments in the sector, supporting both new projects and the upgrade of existing infrastructure</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tr><td>Increase in cross border power transfer</td><td><ul><li>India's central location in South Asia has sparked regional energy cooperation, with the Ministry of Power introducing guidelines for cross-border electricity trade in 2018 to facilitate imports and exports with neighboring countries.</li><li>Multiple transmission projects are planned or underway, including lines connecting India to Nepal, Myanmar, and others, while the "One Sun One World One Grid" (OSOWOG) initiative is under discussion to create a global renewable energy grid, potentially interconnecting with countries like Maldives, Singapore, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.</li><li>Once completed, these initiatives will further boost India's transmission infrastructure, attracting new investments and driving growth in the sector.</li></ul></td></tr></table>
