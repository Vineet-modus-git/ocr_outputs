While the coal sector is anticipated to expand, albeit at a moderate pace, coal will play a crucial role in meeting peak demand due to its ability to rapidly ramp up generation. This is particularly important given the expected 5 to 7% CAGR growth in power demand and the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the stress on gas-based power plants, exacerbated by high gas prices and inadequate supply, has underscored the importance of coal in ensuring a reliable energy mix. As a result, coal retirements are expected to be negligible between fiscal 2026 to 2030."}, {"bbox": [190, 407, 1461, 572], "category": "Text", "text": "With boost to rooftop solar and declining cost of renewable energy generation, the off-grid solar generation is expected to increase, reducing power demand from grid.
