NOTE 36: EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)

Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the restated profit for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the restated profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

The following reflects the restated profit and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computation:

* Since earning per share based on diluted weighted average number of shares is anti dilutive, the basic and diluted earning per share for the year ended 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 are same.
