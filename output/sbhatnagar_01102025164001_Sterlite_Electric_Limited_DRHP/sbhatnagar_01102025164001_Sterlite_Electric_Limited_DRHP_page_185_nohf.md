Access to long-term and affordable debt is essential for power sector projects given the high upfront costs that are typical for energy projects like renewables. Persistent inflationary pressures and high interest rates act as an impediment to debt finance. In the recent years, spikes in interest rates have constrained fiscal capacity, with government has faced challenge in funding targeted incentives.

Power projects are highly capital intensive and have a long gestation period. Completion of projects in a time bound manner is very critical for developers to avoid the huge time and cost overruns. In the past, thermal power projects have witnessed significant cost overruns on account of delays in receipt of clearances, land acquisition and financial closure. In fact, in certain projects, there has been cost overruns of as high as 67% resulting in project cost escalating to ₹ 75 million per MW as compared to initially envisaged ₹ 45 million per MW.

## Right of way and Environmental clearance

The acquisition of land and securing RoW for transmission lines has become a significant challenge, resulting in delayed project timelines and increased costs. According to the CEA monthly progress report for February 2025, over 50% of ISTS projects awarded under the TBCB route have cited right-of-way issues as the primary reason for project delays

The process of obtaining environmental clearance for transmission lines that traverse forest areas is also causing delays in project timelines, ultimately leading to increased costs. As per the CEA monthly progress report, over 30% of the projects are facing challenges related to forest and wildlife clearance, highlighting the significance of this issue in hindering project progress. Hydro power projects have also been crippled due to execution challenges like securing necessary approvals (environmental and forest clearances), land acquisition and relocation of people habitant in the area, inadequate infrastructure for power evacuation and logistical issues have constantly hampered the pace of project execution.

## Grid Integration

To facilitate the transfer of power between neighbouring states, state grids are inter-connected through high-voltage transmission links to form a regional grid. There are five regional grids, namely, Northern, Western, Southern, Eastern and North-eastern grids. As peak demand for power does not take place at the same time in all states, it results in a surplus in one state and a deficit in another. Regional or inter-state grids facilitate the transfer of power from a surplus region to the one facing a deficit. Additionally, they also facilitate the optimal scheduling of maintenance outages and better coordination between power plants.

The Indian national grid has evolved over a period of past 60 years all the way from isolated state grids to regional grids and finally with the commissioning of 765 kV transmission line between Raichur and Solapur in December 2013 India achieved one nation one Grid status. Integration of the regional grid networks into the national grid involves several institutional, technical, and commercial complications and issues. Over the medium term, investments in the transmission sector are expected to focus on forming the national grid, by setting up inter-regional links and strengthening the regional and intra-state grids.

## Open access transactions to limit demand for power utilities

Short-term market transactions are expected to account for 12.5 to 13.5% of power generation as of fiscal 2026. Share of the short-term transactions are expected to increase to 13.5 to 14.5% by fiscal 2030 primarily driven by demand pressure, better price discovery at exchanges. Demand on the short-term market is expected to add an average of 19 to 20 BUs between fiscal 2026 to 2030 resulting in diversion in power supply from utility demand.

## Key government schemes and investment for the power sector in India

### Policies and initiatives of Indian government to boost power sector in India backed by strong budgetary allocations

The Government of India implemented multiple initiatives aimed at ensuring uninterrupted power supply to every household since 2014. Under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) introduced in 2014, and the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA), introduced in 2017, about ₹ 1850 billion has been invested to boost distribution infrastructure across various states. Consequently, 18,374 villages have been electrified under DDUGJY, and 29 million households have gained access to electricity through SAUBHAGYA. The capital outlay for these initiatives are done through the budget for ministry of power and ministry of new & renewable energy. As per the latest budget, ₹ 218.5 billion and ₹ 265.5 billion has been allocated to ministry of power and ministry of new & renewable energy, respectively.
