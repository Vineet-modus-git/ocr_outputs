statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.

If an entity's share of losses of an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture (which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint ventures), the entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.

Unrealised gains resulting from the transactions between the Group and its associate or joint venture, to the extent of Group's interests in the associate or joint venture, are eliminated in the statement of profit and loss from the line item "Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures" and in the balance sheet against the carrying amounts of the associate or joint venture. Where such unrealised gains, to the extent of Group's interests in the associate or joint venture, exceed the carrying amounts of the associate or joint venture, such excess is presented as deferred income. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture impairment. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognizes the loss as 'Share of profit of an associate and joint venture' in the statement of profit or loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or loss of joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence/joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

## Current versus non-current classification

The Group presents all assets and liabilities other than deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification as per Group's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III (Division II) to the Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

An asset is treated as current when it is:

* Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle

* Held primarily for the purpose of trading

* Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or

* Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least

* twelve months after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is current when:

* It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle

* It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

* It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or

* There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
