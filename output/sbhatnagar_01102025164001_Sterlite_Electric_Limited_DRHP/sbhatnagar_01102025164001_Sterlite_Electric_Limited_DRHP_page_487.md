## Significant Dependence on Few Customers or Suppliers

We have derived and believe that in the foreseeable future will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers which may not be the same every year. See "Risk Factors – We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Our top 10 customers accounted for 46.00%, 56.82% and 66.72%, of our revenue from operations (continuing operations) in Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Loss of relationship with any of these customers or delays or reductions in their orders may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows." on page 45.

Further, we depend on a few suppliers for the supply of our raw materials. See "Risk Factors - We depend on a few suppliers for the supply of our primary raw materials and any disruption in the supply or increase in the prices of raw materials could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our top 10 suppliers accounted for 83.22%, 74.63% and 79.53% of our total cost of raw materials in Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively." on page 45.
