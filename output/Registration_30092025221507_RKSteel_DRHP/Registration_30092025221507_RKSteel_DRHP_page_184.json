From FY 2020 to FY 2025, outstanding projects in the sector more than quintupled from INR 24.4 billion to INR 131.9 billion. Equally significant is the rise in the number of such projects, which jumped from 14 in FY 2020 to 44 by FY 2025. This indicates not only a strong investor appetite but also broader institutional and private sector confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the steel pipe industry, driven by rising demand from infrastructure, oil & gas, water supply, and urban development sectors."}, {"bbox": [234, 1215, 1498, 1444], "category": "Text", "text": "New investments followed a similar upward trajectory, with capital inflows surging from INR 2.74 billion in FY 2020 to a peak of INR 96.87 billion in FY 2024, before moderating slightly to INR 14.42 billion in FY 2025. This is mirrored in the number of new projects initiated, which rose from 3 in FY 2020 to 24 in FY 2024, settling at 13 in FY 2025. The spike in FY 2024 reflects a strategic buildup in manufacturing capacity and modernization projects, likely driven by India's renewed focus on domestic self-reliance in industrial raw materials and intermediate goods. The dip in FY 2025 could reflect a temporary normalization after an exceptional year of announcements, possibly indicating project execution and consolidation phases."}, {"bbox": [234, 1471, 1498, 1699], "category": "Text", "text": "Prominent ongoing and planned projects further validate the capital surge. Under-implementation projects as of March 2026 include Maharashtra Seamless Ltd.'s Mangaon Cold-Drawn Pipeline and OCTG Line Project and Electrosteel Castings Ltd.'s Srikalahasti DI Pipe Plant Expansion (Phase 2). On the announcement front, key developments include Jindal Saw Ltd.'s Haresamudram DI Pipe Plant and Tech AIC DRI Pellets Pvt. Ltd.'s Keonjhar Integrated Steel Products Plant. Together, these large-scale investments—particularly in Odisha and Karnataka—highlight a regional concentration of steel tube capacity expansion, driven by logistical proximity to mineral belts and port infrastructure."}, {"bbox": [234, 1726, 1498, 1890], "category": "Text", "text": "A major catalyst for this investment momentum is the sharp rise in downstream consumption from sectors such as water infrastructure, agriculture, urban sanitation, and power transmission. Additionally, technological shifts like ERW (Electric Resistance Welded) and seamless pipe demand in oil & gas and renewable energy are compelling manufacturers to upgrade production lines. Export opportunities have also played a role, especially with anti-dumping measures by global players creating room for Indian producers in overseas markets."}, {"bbox": [234, 1916, 1527, 2087], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><td>Company Name</td><td>Project Name</td><td>Status</td><td>Expected Timeline</td><td>Project Cost (INR Mn)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GOODLUCK INDIA LTD.</td><td>Bulandshar Hydraulic Tubes Manufacturing Plant</td><td>Under Implementation</td><td>FY 2025</td><td>2,000</td></tr></tbody></table>"}]
