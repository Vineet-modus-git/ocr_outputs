The consumption side was further supported by the adoption of mild steel pipes in various secondary applications like scaffolding systems, greenhouse structures, and material handling setups across SME and MSME segments. As small manufacturers pursued capacity upgrades, the demand for cost-effective yet durable structural components such as ERW (electric resistance welded) and GI (galvanized iron) pipes witnessed steady growth. Additionally, government efforts to modernize agri-water distribution and rural electrification also bolstered offtake in non-urban geographies, contributing to a wider geographic spread in consumption patterns.

From the production perspective, Indian pipe manufacturers increasingly adopted automated forming and welding technologies, enabling better yield and faster production cycles. This shift helped domestic players not only match rising domestic demand but also improve product consistency and quality, reducing reliance on imports. Additionally, the introduction of BIS certification norms across various categories helped standardize production while encouraging investment in compliance-ready manufacturing units. Overall, India's mild steel pipe and tube market in this period displayed a healthy and scalable growth model, balancing demand pull and production readiness.

## Key Demand Drivers

The growth drivers for the Mild Steel (MS) pipes and tubes industry in India are multifaceted, influenced by infrastructure development, government initiatives, and sectoral demand. The key factors promoting production and consumption of MS pipes and tubes in India are listed as below:

* **Infrastructure Development**

* **Government Initiatives** – Programs such as the Jal Jeevan Mission, Nal Se Jal, Namami Gange, AMRUT, PMKSY (pipelines for irrigation of farm land), Command Area Development & Water Management - CADWM, National Gas Grid (providing pipeline infrastructure for natural gas transportation), Bharatmala (highway construction with boundaries and barricades) are significantly boosting demand for MS pipes. These initiatives focus on providing safe drinking water, improving sanitation, and pipeline infrastructure for natural gas which require extensive piping systems.

* **Transportation Projects** – Investments in roads, railways, and urban infrastructure are driving the need for robust piping solutions, contributing to increased consumption of MS pipes.

* **Rising Demand in Key Sectors**

* **Oil and Gas Industry** – The oil and gas sector is a major consumer of steel pipes, with 7-12% of capital expenditure allocated to steel pipes for refining and distribution. The expansion of city gas distribution networks further fuels this demand.

* **Construction Sector** – With over 50% of the total demand for steel pipes coming from the construction industry, ongoing residential and commercial projects continue to drive consumption.

* **Technological Advancements**

Continuous improvements in manufacturing processes have enhanced productivity and quality, allowing Indian manufacturers to compete effectively on a global scale. This includes advancements in welding technologies for producing high-quality ERW (Electric Resistance Welded) pipes.

* **Geographical Advantages**

India benefits from abundant raw materials, a skilled workforce, and relatively low production costs. These factors contribute to making India one of the leading manufacturing hubs for steel pipes globally.

* **Sustainability Trends**

There is a growing emphasis on sustainable practices within the industry, including the use of recycled materials and eco-friendly production methods. This trend aligns with global movements towards reducing carbon footprints in manufacturing.
