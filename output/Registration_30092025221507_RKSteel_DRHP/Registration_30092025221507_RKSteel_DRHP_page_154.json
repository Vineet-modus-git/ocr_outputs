This segment encompasses various types such as bars and rods, including high-strength thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) bars widely used in construction, and structural steel, comprising angles, channels, beams, and fabricated sections essential for infrastructure development. Railway materials also fall under this category, catering to the growing Indian rail network. *Flat products*, on the other hand, are produced from slabs or thin slabs in rolling mills utilizing flat rolls. This segment includes hot-rolled (HR) coils and cold-rolled (CR) coils, with CR coils undergoing further processing to achieve enhanced surface finish, reduced thickness, and tailored mechanical properties."}, {"bbox": [234, 1504, 613, 1541], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Types of Steel Tubes and Pipes:"}, {"bbox": [234, 1568, 1499, 1732], "category": "Text", "text": "Steel tubes and pipes are a type of steel product that possess a hollow interior with varying diameters.
