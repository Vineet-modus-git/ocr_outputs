This seemingly modest drop reflects a deeper structural shift toward self-reliance, as domestic manufacturing capabilities continue to evolve in response to both policy support and market demand. The Indian steel industry has been gradually enhancing its technological capabilities, product range, and quality standards, particularly in segments like seamless, alloy, and corrosion-resistant tubes, thereby reducing the need for imported alternatives. This progress is driven by government initiatives such as 'Make in India' and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which are incentivizing investment in capacity expansion and value-added production. Furthermore, increasing adoption of domestic products by core industries like oil & gas, power, chemicals, construction, automotive, and engineering indicates rising confidence in local suppliers. Factors such as global shipping disruptions, extended delivery timelines, and import compliance challenges (including quality certifications like BIS) have further strengthened the case for local sourcing. While imports still play a key role in meeting niche and highly specialized requirements particularly for sectors like aerospace, defense, and nuclear energy the overall decline in FY2025 underscores a positive trajectory toward reducing foreign dependence and building a more resilient, self-sufficient steel ecosystem in India."}, {"bbox": [235, 1382, 1497, 1450], "category": "Text", "text": "Although imports remain crucial for select applications, multiple factors are beginning to moderate the reliance on foreign suppliers:"}, {"bbox": [235, 1480, 1497, 2070], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Improved Domestic Product Range and Quality:** Indian manufacturers have significantly expanded their product offerings, including advanced and high-grade steel tubes, which were earlier dependent on imports. This development has started substituting for a portion of the import demand.\n* **Rising Investment in Indigenous Capabilities:** With support from PLI schemes and a push for import substitution, several domestic steel makers have invested in upgrading their plants to produce seamless and high-pressure pipes, reducing the technology gap with global players.\n* **Supply Chain Localization Initiatives:** Key sectors such as defense, automotive, and energy are under government directives to increase domestic sourcing. This has led to closer collaborations between user industries and domestic steel suppliers, thereby reducing foreign procurement.\n* **Improved Infrastructure and Logistics Ecosystem:** India's growing steel clusters and upgraded logistics networks have reduced lead times and costs, making local sourcing more attractive and reliable for time-sensitive industrial projects.\n* **Import Licensing and Quality Control Measures:** Tighter BIS certification norms and mandatory quality checks for imported steel products have created compliance hurdles for foreign suppliers, naturally encouraging the adoption of domestic alternatives.\n* **Volatile Global Shipping and Geopolitical Risks:** Frequent disruptions in global shipping routes and rising geopolitical tensions have highlighted the risks associated with over-dependence on imports. Domestic sourcing now offers a more stable and predictable supply chain."}]
