For example, Germany ranked fifth in total exports with 22.6 million tonnes but dropped to sixth in net exports with just 4.3 million tonnes, suggesting a strong internal demand and significant import reliance. Similarly, Belgium and Italy had substantial total exports (15.4 and 15.0 million tonnes respectively), but much lower net export positions, reflecting their role as both importers and exporters within tightly integrated regional markets like the EU. In contrast, countries like Iran and Brazil showed strong net export positions relative to their overall volumes, indicating a more outward-facing steel industry and possibly lower internal consumption."}, {"bbox": [233, 1023, 1499, 1254], "category": "Text", "text": "Russia and Ukraine also present notable cases.
