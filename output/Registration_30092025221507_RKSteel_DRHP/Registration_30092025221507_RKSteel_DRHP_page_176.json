These three countries formed the core of India's export strategy, supported by Canada and Morocco, which secured the fourth and fifth positions respectively. The volume-based ranking highlights India's strong presence in markets undergoing major construction, energy, and development projects. However, the ranking shifts when measured by export value, influenced by factors such as product specifications, grade, and logistics costs. Countries like the USA, UAE, and Indonesia often rank higher in value terms due to their preference for specialized or high-end steel pipes and tubes, resulting in better per-unit realization and showcasing India's versatility in serving both bulk and premium markets."}, {"bbox": [236, 1248, 676, 1286], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Historical Trend Analysis of Imports"}, {"bbox": [234, 1313, 1499, 1606], "category": "Text", "text": "India continues to import steel tubes and pipes to bridge the demand-supply gap in specialized applications where domestic capabilities are either limited or still maturing. These imports cater to critical sectors such as oil and gas exploration, petrochemicals, and heavy engineering, where high-performance and corrosion-resistant pipes are essential. In addition, emerging demand from industries such as power generation (including nuclear and thermal), renewable energy (notably wind energy structures), aerospace, shipbuilding, chemical processing, and precision medical equipment has contributed to the need for technically advanced steel tubes and pipes. These segments often require customized grades, superior metallurgical properties, or global certifications - features not yet fully developed or widely produced in the domestic market. As a result, imports remain a vital supplement to India's steel ecosystem, particularly for high-spec, application-specific requirements."}]
