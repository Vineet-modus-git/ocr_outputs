## Manufacturing Process

MS Steel pipes and tubes are made through proper material selection, where the quality and performance of the product is based on the quality of MS steel used in this process. Therefore, material selection is the most important process. This selected material, which is available in different grades of steel are then shaped into pipes through extrusion or rolling process to make a seamless pipe and tube. When the sheets are welded to form a pipe, it becomes welded MS steel pipe. These pipes are checked for quality control, where each batch undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets industry standards for strength, durability, and corrosion resistance.

**Based on the Manufacturing Process** MS steel pipes and tubes are classified into

* **Seamless Pipes**: Manufactured without welding seams, providing greater strength and uniformity, suitable for high-pressure applications.

* **Welded Pipes**: Welded pipes are manufactured by rolling a steel plate or strip into a cylindrical shape and then joining the edges using various welding techniques. The edges are welded together using heat and pressure to create a strong and continuous seam. After welding, the pipe undergoes processes like seam trimming, heat treatment, sizing, and quality inspection to ensure durability and uniformity. There are three main methods of welded pipe manufacturing; however, we have focus on two types: ERW (Electric Resistance Welding) and SAW (Submerged Arc Welding)

* **ERW (Electric Resistance Welding)**: The process begins with hot-rolled steel coils or strips, which are uncoiled, levelled, and cut into the required widths for pipe formation. Using precision forming rollers, the steel strip is gradually shaped into a circular tube. The edges of the formed tube are then heated using high-frequency electric current and pressed together under controlled pressure, creating a strong and seamless-looking weld without the need for filler material. After welding, the excess weld bead is trimmed, and the pipe undergoes heat treatment to relieve stresses and enhance its mechanical properties. The pipe is then passed through sizing rollers to achieve the desired dimensions before being cut to the required lengths. ERW pipes are widely used in the steel industry for applications such as water pipelines, structural frameworks, furniture, fencing, and oil & gas transportation due to their cost-effectiveness, consistent quality, and efficient production process.

* **SAW (Submerged Arc Welding)**: In the steel manufacturing industry, the Submerged Arc Welding (SAW) process is an essential method for producing high-strength welded pipes used in critical applications such as oil & gas pipelines, water transmission, and structural projects. The process starts with steel plates or coils, which are shaped into a cylindrical form either longitudinally (LSAW – Longitudinal Submerged Arc Welding) or helically (SSAW or HSAW – Spiral Submerged Arc Welding). Welding is performed using the submerged arc technique, where an electrode and welding arc are covered by a flux layer, protecting the weld from contamination and ensuring deep penetration for a strong, defect-free joint. After welding, the pipes undergo heat treatment to improve mechanical properties, followed by thorough inspection and testing to meet industry standards. The final step involves sizing the pipes to precise specifications, making them ideal for demanding applications such as offshore projects and large-scale fluid transportation. The SAW process is widely utilized in the steel industry due to its capability to produce thick-walled, durable, and high-performance pipes.

The classic difference between seamless and welded MS pipes are captured below:

<table><thead><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Seamless Pipes</td><td>Welded Pipes</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Manufacturing Process</td><td>Made from a single piece of metal without seams, through extrusion or piercing.</td><td>Formed by welding together metal sheets or strips, creating a seam.</td></tr><tr><td>Strength</td><td>Absence of seams offer high strength, ability to withstand high pressure and loads.</td><td>Welded seam can be a weak point, so has lesser strength, with the ability to withstand about 20% less pressure than seamless pipes.</td></tr><tr><td>Length</td><td>Shorter due to manufacturing constraints.</td><td>Can be produced in long continuous</td></tr></tbody></table>
