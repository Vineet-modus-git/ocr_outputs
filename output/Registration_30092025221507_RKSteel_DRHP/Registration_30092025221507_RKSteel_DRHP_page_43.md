A large portion of our revenue is derived from a narrow set of products, particularly GP pipes and GI pipes, out of which GP pipes accounted for 43.66%, 49.74% and 62.66% of our revenue from operations in Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively and GI pipes accounted for 10.77%, 13.62% and 14.46% respectively.

Any adverse change in the demand for our product categories specifically GP pipes, whether on account of (i) changes in customer preferences, (ii) reduced infrastructure or industrial investments, (iii) availability of substitute materials (such as plastic or composite pipes), (iv) technological changes, or (v) regulatory or environmental restrictions, could materially and adversely affect our revenue, margins, and profitability.

Further, demand for steel pipes and coils is inherently cyclical and strongly correlated with the performance of key end-use sectors such as construction, infrastructure, automobile, solar power and engineering, etc. A slowdown in these industries, adverse macroeconomic conditions, reduction in government capital expenditure, or delays in infrastructure projects could directly impact our sales volumes.

## 6. Our Profit After Tax ("PAT") and Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation, Tax and Amortisation ("EBITDA") declined significantly in Fiscal 2025 despite an increase in revenue from operations, indicating margin contraction and reduced profitability, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our revenue from operations increased from ₹84,744.25 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹1,02,216.00 lakhs in Fiscal 2024, and further to ₹1,14,779.33 lakhs in Fiscal 2025. Over the same period, our EBITDA increased from ₹4,713.40 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹5,955.37 lakhs in Fiscal 2024, but declined to ₹4,829.82 lakhs in Fiscal 2025. Similarly, our Profit After Tax (PAT) increased from ₹1,988.15 lakhs in Fiscal 2023 to ₹2,270.41 lakhs in Fiscal 2024, but decreased significantly to ₹1,090.63 lakhs in Fiscal 2025.
