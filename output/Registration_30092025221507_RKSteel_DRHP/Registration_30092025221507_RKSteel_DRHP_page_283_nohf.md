(b) Property plant and equipment and Investment property (continued):

Pursuant to this policy, Management's estimates of useful life of the following assets are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td>Category of assets</td><td>Useful life estimated by management</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Building</td><td>30 years</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold improvements</td><td>Lease term</td></tr><tr><td>Plant & Machinery</td><td>15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and Fixtures</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>3 years</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Solar Plant</td><td>25 years</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>8 years</td></tr></tbody></table>

Pro-rata depreciation is provided on all Property, plant and equipment purchased or sold during the year.

Property, plant & equipment are de-recognised when the entity transfers control of the same to the buyer. Further the entity also de-recognises property, plant & equipment when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss in the year of de-recognition.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

The cost incurred during ongoing capital projects, which are not ready for their intended use are disclosed as capital work in progress.

(ii) Investment Property

Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the Company, is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.

(c) Intangible assets

Under the previous GAAP (Indian GAAP), all intangible assets were carried in the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities at cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. On transition to Ind-AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value for all of its intangible assets recognized as of April 01, 2022 (date of transition to Ind-AS) measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost as at the date of transition.

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Amortization

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Cost of intangible assets under development as at the reporting date are disclosed as intangible assets under development.

A summary of amortization policies applied to the Company's intangible assets is as below:
