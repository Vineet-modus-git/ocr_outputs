a challenge, either paying the tax, which would make products less competitive due to higher landed costs, or investing in decarbonization technologies, which may involve significant capital expenditure and long gestation periods.

The D&B Report also highlights that in response to a slowing global economy, many countries have begun imposing trade barriers to restrict imports from China and other low-cost economies, as a measure to protect domestic industries. While Indian manufacturers may benefit from lower dumping in export markets, they also face indirect consequences in the form of cost escalations. Although some level of raw material pricing is hedged, frequent fluctuations in input costs can drive up the cost of production, thereby impacting pricing flexibility and margins.

These cumulative risks, arising from import dependency, material substitution, carbon taxation, and raw material cost volatility, pose challenges to the industry's growth, investment appetite, and global competitiveness. Any material impact of these factors could constrain the financial and operational performance of steel pipes and tubes manufacturers operating in India

**24. We operate in a highly competitive business environment, and competition from existing players and new entrants, coupled with consequent pricing pressures, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition, and results of operations.**

The Indian steel industry, including the welded pipes, tubes, and coils segment in which we operate, is highly competitive and fragmented. We face competition from both established domestic players and new entrants, some of whom may have larger operating capacities, stronger financial resources, and greater bargaining power. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting our business include product quality, capacity creation and utilization, changes in manufacturing technology, logistics feasibility, workforce skill and productivity, operating costs, pricing power with large buyers, access to funding, the degree of regulation, and access to a reliable supply of raw materials.

Our ability to maintain or increase market share will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives, our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, our success in improving manufacturing processes and techniques, and our ability to introduce new products in line with evolving customer requirements. Competition may also arise from global steel producers expanding into India, as well as domestic players pursuing backward or forward integration. These factors could lead to significant price competition, reduced margins, and a decline in revenue. Larger competitors may also have the advantage of negotiating preferential terms for raw materials, bulk procurement, or favourable pricing with distributors and customers, which may not be available to us.

In addition, our competitors may have lower leverage and/or access to cheaper sources of funding. Such financial strength allows them to invest more aggressively in capacity expansion, product development, acquisitions, and customer relationships, thereby displacing demand for our products. The steel industry has also witnessed a gradual trend toward consolidation, and further consolidation could disadvantage smaller players such as us by concentrating market share with larger competitors.

Some of our regional competitors may have advantages over us due to specialization in niche or value-added products, stronger distributor and dealer networks, or deeper customer relationships. While our strategic location in Tamil Nadu provides us with logistical advantages and market access to the southern market, the entry of new players in our operating regions with greater financial and distribution resources could adversely impact our sales and profitability.

Failure to compete effectively may result in the loss of existing customers, inability to secure new orders, erosion of margins, and a decline in profitability. Further, new companies may emerge with innovative business models or competitive pricing strategies to capture a share of our markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors, or that increased competition will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, profitability and margins, cash flows, and financial condition.
