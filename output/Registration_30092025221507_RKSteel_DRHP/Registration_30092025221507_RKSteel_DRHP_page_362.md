(g) **Measurement of fair values**

The Company measures financial instruments, such as, investment in equity shares at fair value at each Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

* In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

* In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

* Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

* Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

* Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

### (a) Current versus non-current classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities based on current/non-current classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:

* Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle.

* Held primarily for the purpose of trading

* Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or

* Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is treated as current when:

* It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle

* It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

* It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or

* There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
