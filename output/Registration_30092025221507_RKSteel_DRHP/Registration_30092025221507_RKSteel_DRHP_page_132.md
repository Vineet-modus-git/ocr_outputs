# BASIS FOR THE ISSUE PRICE

The Price Band and the Issue Price will be determined by our Company in consultation with the BRLM, on the basis of assessment of market demand for the Equity Shares issued through the Book Building Process and on the basis of quantitative and qualitative factors as described below, in compliance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations. The face value of the Equity Shares is ₹10 each and the Issue Price is [●] times the face value at the lower end of the Price Band and [●] times the face value at the higher end of the Price Band.
