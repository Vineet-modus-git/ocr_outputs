# Initiatives to Strengthen Domestic Manufacturing Infrastructure

## Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products (DMI&SP)

* Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products (DMI&SP) are those iron and steel products which are manufactured by entities that are registered and established in India, including in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
* In addition, such products shall meet the criteria of domestic minimum value-addition. On 8 May, 2017, the policy was approved by Government which mandates to provide preference to DMI&SP, in Government Procurement in which a minimum value addition of 15% have taken place domestically. This has been revised to 20% in the revised policy dated 31 December, 2020.
* The policy is intended to encourage domestic production and consumption of steel as well as import substitution and promote growth in the industry. The DMI&SP policy applies to government procurement where the estimated value of iron and steel products is INR 500 Million (approximately USD 6 million) or more. This includes tenders issued by various ministries, departments, and public sector undertakings.
* A Standing Committee headed by the Secretary of Steel was established to address clarifications and issues raised by stakeholders regarding the implementation of the policy.
* The DMI&SP policy has been extended beyond its initial deadlines to ensure continued support for domestic manufacturers, reflecting ongoing government commitment to bolster the local steel industry.

## National Steel Policy (NSP), 2017

The National Steel Policy 2017 serves as a strategic roadmap for India's steel industry, focusing on enhancing production capacity, improving self-sufficiency, promoting sustainability, and fostering technological advancements. By setting ambitious targets and encouraging investment, the NSP aims to position India as a leading player in the global steel market while meeting rising domestic demand.

NSP was introduced in 2017 with the objective to increase domestic steel production and consumption, produce high-quality steel and increasing India's competitiveness globally. It also focuses on cost efficiency, raw material availability and research & development to achieve the overall objectives laid out under the policy. The mission defined under NSP, 2017 is as below:

* Self-sufficiency in steel production by providing policy support & guidance to private manufacturers, MSME steel producers, and CPSEs & encourage adequate capacity additions
* Development of globally competitive steel manufacturing capabilities.
* Cost-efficient production and domestic availability of iron ore, coking coal, and natural gas
* Facilitate investment in overseas asset acquisitions of raw materials
* Enhance domestic steel demand

## Atma Nirbhar Bharat Policy

The Atmanirbhar Bharat Policy, or the "Self-Reliant India" initiative, is a comprehensive strategy launched by the Government of India to promote self-sufficiency across various sectors, including the steel industry. Initiatives such as Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat which consists of 5 pillars (Economy, Infrastructure, System, Vibrant Demography and Demand) has been playing a significant role in economic development.

The policy emphasizes increasing crude steel production capacity from 154 million tonnes (MT) to 300 MT by 2030. This ambitious target aims to make India one of the largest steel producers globally and reduce dependency on imports. Atmanirbhar Bharat encourages the use of domestically produced steel in infrastructure projects and public procurement. This initiative is designed to boost local manufacturing capabilities and create jobs within the
