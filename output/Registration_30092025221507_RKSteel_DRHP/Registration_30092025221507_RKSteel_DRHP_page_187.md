* **Safety Standards**

Regulations related to safety in construction and industrial applications require the use of certified materials. This drives demand for MS pipes that meet stringent safety standards, ensuring they are suitable for high-pressure applications.

The regulatory landscape governing the steel pipe and tube industry in India is shaped by BIS standards, quality control measures, environmental regulations, government initiatives promoting infrastructure development, adherence to international standards, and safety requirements. These factors collectively influence production practices, product quality, and market dynamics within the MS pipe sector.

**Anti-Dumping Duty**

The anti-dumping duty on steel in India is a critical regulatory measure aimed at protecting domestic manufacturers from unfair competition posed by imported steel products sold at prices below their production costs. The imposition of anti-dumping duties on steel in India significantly impacts the overall steel market, influencing pricing, competition, and the dynamics between domestic producers and importers.

**Overview of Anti-Dumping Duties**

* The primary goal of anti-dumping duties is to safeguard domestic industries from the adverse effects of subsidized imports that can disrupt the market and harm local manufacturers.
* In September 2024, the Indian government extended the anti-subsidy duty on imports of welded stainless-steel pipes and tubes from China and Vietnam for an additional five years. This decision follows an investigation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), which found that these products were being exported at prices below their production costs due to subsidies provided by their governments.
* The anti-dumping investigations are initiated in response to complaints from domestic industry associations. In October 2021, a notification was passed by Ministry of Finance, Government of India based on the recommendation made by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) to extend the anti-dumping duty on Stainless Steel Seamless Tubes and Pipes from China for a period of 5 years.
* In December 2022, the Indian Government has imposed an anti-dumping duty on Stainless Steel Seamless Tubes and Pipes from China which is the top exporting country for India with a share of 60% in total imports, to protect the domestic players.
* The custom duty was placed on Stainless-Steel Seamless Tubes and Pipes with diameter up to and including 6 NPS, or comparable thereof in other unit of measurement, whether manufactured using hot extrusion process or hot piercing process and whether sold as hot finished or cold finished pipes and tubes, including subject goods imported in the form of defectives, non-prime or secondary grades originating in or exported from China.
* The duties levied on the products are in range from USD 114 to USD 3,801 per tonne. This act came effective because of continuous and massive dumping of goods from the import country despite the duties that were in effect and affected the domestic market.
* The imposition of anti-dumping duties aims to create a level playing field for Indian manufacturers, allowing them to compete more effectively against subsidized foreign products. While these duties may increase import costs, officials have assured that they will not significantly affect product availability in the Indian market.
* The Indian government has also been considering increasing import duties on steel from the current 7.5% to between 10% and 12% as part of its strategy to combat dumping practices further.

The anti-dumping duty framework in India plays a vital role in shielding domestic steel manufacturers from unfair trade practices associated with subsidized imports. Recent extensions and proposed increases in duties indicate a continued commitment by the Indian government to protect local industries while navigating the challenges posed by global market dynamics. These measures are crucial for ensuring the sustainability and competitiveness of India's steel sector amidst rising imports and geopolitical tensions.
