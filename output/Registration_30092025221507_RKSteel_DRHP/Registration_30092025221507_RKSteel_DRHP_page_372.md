Foreign currency transactions are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Company uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Non-monetary items, which are measured in terms of historical cost denominated in a foreign currency, are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on reporting monetary items of Company at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded during the year, or reported in previous financial statements, are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which they arise.

(j) **Retirement and other employee benefits**

Retirement benefit in the form of Provident Fund and Pension Fund are defined contribution schemes. The Company recognizes contribution payable to the schemes as an expense which is charged to profit & loss, when an employee renders the related service. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the fund.

The Company operates a defined benefit plan for its employees for gratuity. The costs of providing benefits under this plan is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation at each year end using the projected unit credit method.

Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods.

Past service costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss on the earlier of:

* The date of the plan amendment or curtailment and

* The date that the company recognises related restructuring costs

Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the defined benefit liability. The Company recognises the following changes in the defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit and loss:

(i) Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and

(ii) Interest expense
Expenses in respect of other Short-term benefits is recognised on the basis of the amount paid or payable for the period for which the services are rendered by the employees.

(k) **Taxes**

**Current income tax**

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised outside the statement of profit and loss (either in OCI or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Company shall reflect the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment by using either most likely method or expected value method, depending on which method predicts better resolution of the treatment.
