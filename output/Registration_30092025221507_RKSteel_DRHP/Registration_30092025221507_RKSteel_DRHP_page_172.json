The stronger CAGR in consumption compared to production reflects robust end-use demand, particularly in emerging markets and energy-intensive sectors. Looking ahead, the focus will likely shift toward technology integration, sustainability, and regional capacity expansion to support rising infrastructure and utility demands. With ongoing geopolitical shifts and energy transitions reshaping global steel trade flows, the mild steel pipe industry is expected to evolve with more localized supply chains and product specialization, reinforcing its importance in global infrastructure development."}, {"bbox": [232, 2003, 534, 2036], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**Indian Market scenario:**"}, {"bbox": [232, 2065, 1498, 2136], "category": "Text", "text": "India's mild steel pipes and tubes market expanded from USD 14.5 billion in FY 2021 to USD 22.3 billion in FY 2025, achieving a robust CAGR of **11.4%**.
