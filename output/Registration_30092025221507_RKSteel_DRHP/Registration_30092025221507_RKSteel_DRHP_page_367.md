and Loss on straight line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis which is more representative of the pattern of use of underlying asset.

The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less, except where it anticipates renewals and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

### Transition to Ind AS 116

The Company accounted for its leases in accordance with Ind AS 116 from the date of initial application.

## (e) Financial Instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

### Financial assets

#### Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient, the Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer to the accounting policies in section (k) Revenue from contracts with customers.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)' on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.

The Company's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while financial assets classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

#### Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

* (i) Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)

* (ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)

* (iii) Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and
