In cases where additional customization is needed, galvanized coils undergo another slitting process to ensure the precise width required for tube manufacturing. This ensures that the input material for tube mills meets the exact specifications.

*Quality Check:* Each slit coil is inspected for precision and consistency.

*Processing:* These coils are then fed into the tube mill for further manufacturing.

## 7. Tube Mill Processing

In this stage, the slit steel strips are formed into cylindrical tubes using tube mills. The process includes:

*Forming:* The slit strips are shaped into a circular profile using forming rollers.

*Welding:* The edges of the formed strip are welded together using a high-frequency induction (HFI) welding process.

*Sizing & Cutting:* The welded tube passes through sizing rollers to achieve the required diameter and is then cut to the desired length.

*Quality Check:* Each tube is inspected for dimensional accuracy, weld integrity, and surface finish.

*Dispatch:* Approved tubes are either sent for hot-dip galvanizing or directly dispatched to customers.

## 8. Hot-Dip Galvanizing (HDG) Process

For tubes requiring additional corrosion resistance, they undergo the hot-dip galvanizing (HDG) process. This involves:

*Surface Preparation:* Tubes are cleaned and pre-treated to remove any contaminants.

*Zinc Bath:* The tubes are dipped into a bath of molten zinc, forming a protective coating.

*Cooling & Finishing:* The galvanized tubes are cooled, inspected, and prepared for final dispatch.

*Quality Check:* Coating thickness and adhesion are tested to meet industry standards.

*Dispatch:* Final products are prepared for shipment.

### Quality Control and Dispatch

At every stage of the manufacturing process, rigorous quality checks are conducted to ensure compliance with product specifications. This includes dimensional accuracy, surface finish, mechanical properties, and coating thickness. Once approved, the finished products are securely packaged and dispatched for delivery to customers.

### INSTALLED CAPACITY, AVAILABLE CAPACITY, ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION

The information relating to the installed capacity, available capacity, actual production and capacity utilization of our products included below and elsewhere in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus has been certified by the Independent Chartered Engineer by certificate dated July 3, 2025. The information on capacity utilization and available capacity is based on various assumptions and estimates and these assumptions and estimates include standard capacity calculation practice in the steel industry and capacity of other ancillary equipment installed at the relevant manufacturing facility. Undue reliance should therefore not be placed on our capacity information or historical capacity utilization information for our existing manufacturing facilities included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The table below sets forth certain information relating to the installed capacity, available capacity, actual production and capacity utilization for our products for the years indicated:
