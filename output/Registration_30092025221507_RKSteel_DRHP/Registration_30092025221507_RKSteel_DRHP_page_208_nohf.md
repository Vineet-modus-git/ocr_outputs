OUR KEY STRENGTHS

We believe that we benefit from the following competitive key strengths:

Established integrated manufacturing setup at strategic location

We operate through our Manufacturing Facility, leveraging over 16 years of operational experience in manufacturing steel pipes and tubes catering to diverse industrial applications. In line with our commitment to continuous expansion, we augmented our manufacturing capacity in 2024 by commissioning five additional tube mills, increasing the total to nine, and installing an additional slitting line, bringing the total to four. our manufacturing facility is now equipped with nine tube mills, four slitting lines, two continuous galvanizing lines, one tandem cold rolling mill, one pickling unit, and one hot dip galvanizing unit, ensuring an efficient and streamlined manufacturing process. According to the D&B Report, we are among the few companies in South India with a tandem cold rolling mill, enabling efficient cold-rolled product manufacturing while ensuring consistency in production and supply. The cold rolling machine also allows us to efficiently control various critical input parameters of the raw material that we use for production of tubes and pipes ensuring quality standards. We use a combination of mechanized and human skills to achieve the desired standards of manufacturing

We continuously strive to expand our production capacity and streamline processes to achieve economies of scale. The table below presents details of our installed capacity and aggregate utilized capacity as of last three Fiscals.:
