Since logistics is the lifeline for supply of materials, high logistics cost result in higher cost of production, thus affecting the cost-competitiveness of the country. One reason for high logistic cost could also be high dependence on road network through trucks with smaller fleet, compared with global competitors. For example, Indian trucks have a capacity in the range of 16 and 25 tonne for transporting high-capacity volumes, while in China, high capacity truck is in the range of 25 to 40 tonne."}, {"bbox": [340, 466, 1493, 1089], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [630, 1087, 1099, 1118], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: Ministry of Railways, Government of India"}, {"bbox": [235, 1147, 1031, 1181], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Impact of Decarbonisation and CBAM on the Steel Sector**"}, {"bbox": [333, 1181, 1498, 2015], "category": "List-item", "text": "  * The Indian steel industry is responsible for roughly 12% of India's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, surpassing the global average of 7-9%². The emission intensity in the Indian steel industry stands at 2.55 T/TCS³, while the global average emission intensity is 1.91 T/TCS.\n  * India has made a commitment to decrease the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 45% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels and achieve Net Zero by 2070.\n  * To support this target, the Ministry of Steel has committed to achieve a Net-Zero by 2070 and has taken a medium-term target to reduce the emission intensity of the steel sector to 2.4 T/TCS by 2030.\n  * These targets remain critical for steel industry players including steel pipes and tubes manufacturers for reducing the emissions within the set timelines. The reduction of emissions is also vital for the industry to maintain its competitiveness in export markets which is becoming increasingly environment conscious.\n  * European Union (EU) is implementing Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) – a tariff on carbon-intensive imports, which is aimed at preventing carbon leakage from 1st January 2026. The first phase of CBAM will cover iron & steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizer, electricity and hydrogen sectors.\n  * Thus, Indian steel manufacturers and finished steel products manufacturers exporting into the European Union needs to pay a tax of 25% to 30% or work towards reducing its emissions. This is a challenge to Indian steel manufacturers to either pay the tax, which would make their products expensive or invest towards reducing emissions.\n* **Increasing Protectionism and Threat of Trade Diversion into India** – As the global economy is slowing down, many countries are posing barriers to imports from China and other countries to protect its domestic manufacturers. Although raw material pricing is hedged, frequent fluctuation would escalate cost of production and make the final product expensive.\n  * The European Union has imposed anti-dumping duties on cold and hot rolled stainless steel,"}, {"bbox": [233, 2069, 1259, 2142], "category": "Footnote", "text": "² World Steel Organization Report on Climate Change and the Production of Iron and Steel\n³ Tonne of CO2 equivalent per tonne of crude steel"}]
