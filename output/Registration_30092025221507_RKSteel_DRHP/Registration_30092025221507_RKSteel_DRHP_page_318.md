47 Disclosure as per Ind AS 101 First-time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards:

(a) Overall principle:

The Company has prepared the opening balance sheet as per Ind AS as of 1st April, 2022 (the transition date) by recognising all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by Ind AS, not recognising items of assets or liabilities which are not permitted by Ind AS, by reclassifying items from previous GAAP to Ind AS as required under Ind AS, and applying Ind AS in measurement of recognised assets and liabilities

However, this principle is subject to certain mandatory exceptions and certain optional exemptions availed by the Company as detailed below:

Mandatory exceptions and optional exemptions

Classification of Investment:

The Company has determined the classification of debt instruments in terms of whether they meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria based on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the transition date.

Deemed cost for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets:

The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its plant and equipment, capital work-in-progress and intangible assets recognised as of 1st April, 2022 (transition date) measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost as of the transition date.

Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease:

The Company has applied Appendix C of Ind AS 17 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease to determine whether an arrangement existing at the transition date contains a lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at that date.

Classification and measurement of financial assets:

The Company has classified the financial assets in accordance with Ind AS 109 on the basis of facts and circumstances that exist at the date of transition to Ind AS.

Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities:

The Company has applied the derecognition requirements of financial assets and financial liabilities prospectively for transactions occurring on or after 1st April, 2022 (the transition date).

Impairment of financial assets:

The Company has applied the impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 retrospectively; however, as permitted by Ind AS 101, it has used reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to determine the credit risk at the date that financial instruments were initially recognised in order to compare it with the credit risk at the transition date.

Further, the Company has not undertaken an exhaustive search for information when determining, at the date of transition to Ind ASs, whether there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, as permitted by Ind AS 101.
