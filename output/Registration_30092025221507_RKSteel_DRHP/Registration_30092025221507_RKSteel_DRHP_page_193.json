Strengthening domestic policies, including quality control orders (QCOs), and incentives under PLI and Make in India, are further reducing India's dependence on imports. This is aligned with the broader national objective of boosting indigenous manufacturing and ensuring supply chain security."}, {"bbox": [235, 1001, 1498, 1196], "category": "Text", "text": "On the export front, the downward trend is more nuanced. While India remains a key exporter of steel pipes, especially to the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, the reduction in export volumes could be attributed to tightening global competition, shifting trade dynamics, and rising domestic consumption priorities. Additionally, global geopolitical uncertainties and protectionist measures in key markets may limit overseas opportunities. The focus going forward will likely be on enhancing value-added exports and capturing niche global demand, rather than maximizing bulk volumes."}, {"bbox": [235, 1224, 861, 1260], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Expected growth of Global MS pipe & tube segment"}, {"bbox": [235, 1289, 516, 1320], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### Market Size Overview:"}, {"bbox": [235, 1352, 1498, 1484], "category": "Text", "text": "The global mild steel pipes and tubes market is expected to expand from USD 180.9 billion in FY 2025 to USD 255.0 billion by FY 2030, registering a CAGR of 7.1%.
