Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit or loss net off any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. These estimates are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.

### *Onerous contracts*

A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Company from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before such a provision is made, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

### (n) Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the restated Ind AS summary statements unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

Contingent liabilities and commitments are reviewed by the management at each balance sheet date.

### (o) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is computed on Weighted Average Method. Cost of finished goods, raw materials, stores, scraps and work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

### (p) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and deposits held at call with bank or NBFC, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to the insignificant risk of changes in value.

### (q) Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Cash Flows

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby net profit/ (loss) before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. Bank overdrafts are classified as part of cash and cash equivalent, as they form an integral part of an entity's cash management.
