## Financial Instruments (Continued)

### Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

i) Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)

ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)

iii) Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)

iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at amortised cost

A 'financial asset' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and

b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

This category is the most relevant to the Company. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. The Company's financial assets at amortised cost includes trade receivables.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

### Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

i) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or

ii) The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.

### Impairment of financial assets

The Company recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables and other financial assets, the company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

The Company considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 365 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

In general, the Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade receivables that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to past payment history, security by way of deposits, external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash flow projections and available press information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.
