This again underlines the importance of secondary and regional mills in bridging the demand-supply gap, particularly in segments like long products, TMT bars, structural steel, and standard pipes, which are essential for infrastructure and construction projects. These smaller mills, often operating closer to end-use markets, have demonstrated higher responsiveness to short-term demand spikes and lower input cost structures.

The basic understanding of steel tubes and pipes are cylindrical structures made of steel that are generally in hollow shape. However, different shapes, sizes and grades are used to cater the requirements of various industries. Steel pipes are classified as tubes depending on specific diameters and application requirement. India is one of the established manufacturers of steel pipes globally, which is one of the most important sub-industries of the Indian steel sector. Construction, Railways, Oil & gas, agriculture, real estate, engineering, automobile and process industry are some of the key consumers of steel pipes and tubes.
