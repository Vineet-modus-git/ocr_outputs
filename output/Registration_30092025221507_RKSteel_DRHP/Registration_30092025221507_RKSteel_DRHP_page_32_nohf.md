## Risk factors

Specific attention of Investors is invited to "Risk Factors" on page 37. Investors are advised to read the risk factors carefully before taking an investment decision in the Issue. Set forth below are the top 10 risk factors applicable to our Company:

1. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations in a limited number of geographies, and any adverse developments affecting such regions could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

2. We rely substantially on our top 10 suppliers for procurement of raw materials, and any shortage, delay or disruption in their supply could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

3. We derived a significant portion of our revenue from operations from our top 10 customers in Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and we do not have long-term contracts with all of these customers. The loss of one or more such customers or any reduction in their purchases could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

4. We operate from a single manufacturing facility located at Perundurai, Tamil Nadu, India and any disruption at this facility could adversely affect our operations, business and financial condition.

5. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of our welded steel pipes and tubes particularly galvanized plain pipes and any reduction in demand for these products may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, our inability to diversify our product portfolio may constrain our growth and profitability.

6. Our Profit After Tax ("PAT") and Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation, Tax and Amortisation ("EBITDA") declined significantly in Fiscal 2025 despite an increase in revenue from operations, indicating margin contraction and reduced profitability, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

7. Our business is a high volume-low margin business. Any disruption in turnover or inability to grow revenues consistently could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

8. Under-utilization of our production capacities could have an adverse effect on our business, future prospects and future financial performance.

9. Our business is working capital intensive, and any inability to optimize our working capital cycle or rationalize our indebtedness may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, profitability, and growth prospects.

10. Our EBITDA and PAT margins have remained persistently lower than those of our listed industry peers, indicating relatively lower operational profitability and efficiency, which may adversely affect our competitiveness, financial condition and results of operations.
