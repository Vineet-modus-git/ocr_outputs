Annexure V - Corporate information, Basis of preparation and Summary of material accounting policies

(All amounts in Rs. lakhs, except as otherwise stated)

(e) Basis of measurement

The restated Ind AS summary statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items:

Certain financial assets and liabilities - Fair Value

Net defined asset / liability - Fair Value of plan asset less present value of defined benefit obligation

(f) Significant accounting judgement, estimates and assumptions

In preparing these restated Ind AS summary statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.

Judgments, assumptions and estimation uncertainties

Information about critical judgments made in applying accounting policies, assumption and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in:

(a) Judgments

Judgement is required in determining the lease term of contracts with extension and termination options - Company as a lessee.

Judgement required in impairment assessment of financial assets.

b) Estimates and assumptions

Estimation of the incremental borrowing rate used for accounting of leases - company as a lessee

Measurement of useful life of property, plant and equipment.

Fair value measurement of financial instruments.

Deferred tax - Recognition of deferred tax asset on carried forward losses: availability of future taxable profit against which tax losses carried forward can be used

Employee benefits expense, wages and bonus; key actuarial assumptions

(g) Measurement of fair values

The Company measures financial instruments, such as, investment in equity shares at fair value at each Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

- In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
