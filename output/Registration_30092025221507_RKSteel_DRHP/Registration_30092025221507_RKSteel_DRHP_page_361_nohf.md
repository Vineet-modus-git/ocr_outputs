There were certain amendments to standards and interpretations which are applicable for the year ended 31 March, 2025, but either the same are not relevant or do not have an impact on the restated Ind AS summary statements of the Company. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

(c) Going Concern

The Company has necessary resources which would enable it to meet its obligations as and when they fall due during the foreseeable future. These financial statements, therefore, do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of asset or to classification and amount of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared under the going concern assumption.

(d) Functional and presentation currency

These restated Ind AS summary statements are presented in Indian Rupees (Rs.), which is the functional currency and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. All amounts are in Indian Rupees lakhs except share data and per share data, unless otherwise stated.

(e) Basis of measurement

The restated Ind AS summary statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items:

Certain financial assets and liabilities - Fair Value

Net defined asset / liability - Fair Value of plan asset less present value of defined benefit obligation

(f) Significant accounting judgement, estimates and assumptions

In preparing these restated Ind AS summary statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.
