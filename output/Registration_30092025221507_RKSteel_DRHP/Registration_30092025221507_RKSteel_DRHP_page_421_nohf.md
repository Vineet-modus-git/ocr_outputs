Our Company, in consultation with the BRLM, may decide to close the Bid/ Issue Closing Period for QIBs one Working Day prior to the Bid/ Issue Closing Date, in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations.

*UPI mandate end time and date shall be at 05:00 p.m. on Bid/ Issue Closing Date i.e [●].

#QIBs and Non-Institutional Bidders can neither revise their bids downwards nor cancel/withdraw their bids.

**On the Bid/ Issue Closing Date, the Bids shall be uploaded until:**

(i) 4.00 p.m. IST in case of Bids by QIBs and Non-Institutional Bidders, and

(ii) until 5.00 p.m. IST or such extended time as permitted by the Stock Exchanges, in case of Bids by RIBs.

On the Bid/ Issue Closing Date, extension of time may be granted by Stock Exchanges only for uploading Bids received by RIBs after taking into account the total number of Bids received and as reported by the BRLM to the Stock Exchanges.

**The Registrar to the Issue shall submit the details of cancelled/withdrawn/deleted applications to the SCSBs on a daily basis within 60 minutes of the Bid closure time from the Bid/ Issue Opening Date until the Bid/ Issue Closing Date by obtaining the same from the Stock Exchanges. The SCSBs shall unblock such applications by the closing hours of the Working Day and submit the confirmation to the BRLM and the Registrar to the Issue on a daily basis.**

To avoid duplication, the facility of re-initiation provided to Syndicate Members shall preferably be allowed only once per bid/batch and as deemed fit by the Stock Exchanges, after closure of the time for uploading Bids.

**It is clarified that Bids shall be processed only after the application monies are blocked in the ASBA Account and Bids not uploaded on the electronic bidding system or in respect of which the full Bid Amount is not blocked by SCSBs, or not blocked under the UPI Mechanism in the relevant ASBA Account, as the case may be, would be rejected.**

Due to limitation of time available for uploading the Bids on the Bid/ Issue Closing Date, Bidders are advised to submit their Bids one day prior to the Bid/ Issue Closing Date, and in any case, no later than 2:00 pm IST on the Bid/ Issue Closing Date. Any time mentioned in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus is IST. Bidders are cautioned that, in the event a large number of Bids are received on the Bid/ Issue Closing Date, some Bids may not get uploaded due to lack of sufficient time. Such Bids that cannot be uploaded will not be considered for allocation under the Issue. Bids will be accepted only during Monday to Friday (excluding any public holiday).
