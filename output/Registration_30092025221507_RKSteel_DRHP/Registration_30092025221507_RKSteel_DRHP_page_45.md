₹1,874.52 lakhs in Fiscal 2024 to ₹10,715.73 lakhs in Fiscal 2025 i.e. an increase of 471.65%, primarily due to a deliberate scale-up of the trading business. In Fiscal 2025, the Company expanded coil trading, including importing HR Coils and supplying them to local buyers in Chennai and surrounding regions, and took over the coil sales business in Chennai to capitalize on favourable cross-border pricing differentials; trading HR coils were also imported from Korea and Vietnam to service local dealer demand.

Further, employee benefit expenses increased owing to expansion in operational scale and addition of manpower across production, quality, and support functions. Finance costs also rose due to higher working capital borrowings undertaken to support increased operations and inventory levels, coupled with higher prevailing interest rates.

In addition, other operating expenses, including power and fuel, freight and logistics, repairs and maintenance, and administrative overheads, increased due to expanded production activity, inflationary pressures, and the operation of newly commissioned capacity. The share of trading income, which carries lower margins compared to manufacturing, also rose marginally in Fiscal 2025, thereby reducing blended margins.

Moreover, depreciation expenses increased following the capitalization of newly installed equipment, including five additional tube mills and one slitting line, leading to higher non-cash charges.

These factors collectively resulted in a decline in both EBITDA and PAT, alongside contraction in EBITDA and PAT margins, despite revenue growth. There can be no assurance that such margin pressures will not persist in future periods. Any sustained increase in input or finance costs, volatility in raw material prices, or inability to improve cost efficiencies or pricing may continue to adversely affect our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations

## 7. Our business is a high volume-low margin business. Any disruption in turnover or inability to grow revenues consistently could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We operate in a high-volume, low-margin industry where profitability is primarily dependent on achieving scale, operational efficiency, and effective cost management. Due to the nature of the products we manufacture and sell, as well as the competitive intensity in the steel pipes and coils industry, we are often unable to charge higher margins on our products. Our business model is therefore heavily reliant on our ability to regularly grow turnover and efficiently execute key processes such as procurement of raw materials, production scheduling, and timely sales/order execution. Any disruption in turnover growth could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, debt servicing ability, and overall financial condition.
