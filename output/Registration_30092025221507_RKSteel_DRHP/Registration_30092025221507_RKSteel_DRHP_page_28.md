## Summary of Industry

Steel is the primary force behind industrialization, and manufacturing sector. Without steel most of the products in day today life would be impossible, such is the extent of steel usage in every equipment used across the world. Steel production and consumption is one of the key parameters for evaluating a country's economic progress as this metal is an important raw material and yet it is an important intermediate product. Steel is categorized as liquid, crude and finished based on the form in which it is produced, while based on composition, steel is segmented as alloy and non-alloy steel. When steel is in its alloy form, it becomes stainless steel, while in a non-alloy form carbon is added in varying quantities.

The Indian steel industry produces a diverse range of long and flat steel products. Long or Non Flat products, primarily manufactured through hot rolling or forging of blooms, billets, or ingots, are typically supplied in straight lengths or cut lengths, with wire rods being a notable exception as they are supplied in coiled form. This segment encompasses various types such as bars and rods, including high-strength thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) bars widely used in construction, and structural steel, comprising angles, channels, beams, and fabricated sections essential for infrastructure development. Railway materials also fall under this category, catering to the growing Indian rail network. Flat products, on the other hand, are produced from slabs or thin slabs in rolling mills utilizing flat rolls. This segment includes hot-rolled (HR) coils and cold-rolled (CR) coils, with CR coils undergoing further processing to achieve enhanced surface finish, reduced thickness, and tailored mechanical properties.
