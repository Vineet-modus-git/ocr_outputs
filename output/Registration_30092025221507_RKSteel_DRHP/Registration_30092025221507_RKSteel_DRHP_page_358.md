## External Factors

**1. Raw Material Prices & Availability**
* Fluctuations in steel coil prices can significantly affect overall sales. Supply chain disruptions or shortages.

**2. Market Demand & Cyclicality**
* Demand from key sectors: infrastructure, construction, automotive, water pipelines, oil & gas, furniture, etc.
* Economic slowdowns leading to reduced steel consumption.

**3. Competition & Industry Dynamics**
* Pricing pressure from integrated steel majors (JSW, Tata, SAIL) and regional players.
* Import competition (cheap Chinese/other country steel).

**4. Government Policies & Regulations**
* Import/export duties, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures.
* Infrastructure spending policies (boosting demand).
* Environmental regulations (CPCB/TNPCB compliance, ZLD, etc.).

**5. Exchange Rate Movements**
* Impact on imported raw materials (zinc, electrodes, spare parts).
* Export competitiveness of finished goods.

**6. Credit Availability & Interest Rates**
* Financing cost for working capital.
* Availability of trade credit from suppliers or TReDS financing.

**7. Global & Domestic Steel Prices**
* Volatility in benchmark prices (HRC, CRC, galvanized products).
* International market trends impacting Indian realizations.

**8. Geopolitical & Macroeconomic Risks**
* Wars, sanctions, pandemics (affecting both supply chain & demand).
* Inflation and interest rate cycles.

## Internal Factors

**1. Production Efficiency & Capacity Utilization**
* Plant utilization rates and downtime.
* Yield losses, wastages, and breakdowns.

**2. Product Mix & Value Addition**
* Sales of higher-margin products (GP/GC sheets, precision pipes) vs. low-margin (MS pipes, HR).
* Ability to diversify into value-added downstream steel products.

**3. Customer Base & Credit Risk**
* Concentration of customers (dependence on few large buyers).
* Defaults or delayed payments from customers.

**4. Working Capital Management**
* Inventory holding (raw material & finished goods).
* Collection efficiency and receivable cycle.
