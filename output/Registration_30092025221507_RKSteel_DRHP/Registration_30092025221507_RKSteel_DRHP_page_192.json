This surge—nearly 60% over four years—indicates both a substantial increase in production and possible mismatches in demand absorption, especially in the recent years. The decline seen in FY 2022 to 7.99 million tonnes was largely a result of strong post-COVID demand recovery and inventory liquidation, but the sharp build-up thereafter suggests that supply has been outpacing near-term consumption, particularly in sectors like construction and infrastructure where offtake can be cyclical. The FY 2025 figure (14.23 million tonnes as of November 2024) suggests inventory levels are stabilizing but remain elevated, pointing to cautious market sentiment and slower-than-expected demand pick-up despite healthy economic growth projections. Rising inventory levels may also reflect stockpiling ahead of anticipated policy changes or price movements. If the stock-to-consumption ratio continues to climb, it could exert downward pressure on steel prices and may prompt producers to moderate output or seek more export avenues to manage surplus."}, {"bbox": [235, 1752, 440, 1787], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Growth Outlook"}, {"bbox": [235, 1817, 941, 1852], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### Expected Growth in Indian Steel Pipes and Tubes Industry"}, {"bbox": [233, 1879, 1499, 2044], "category": "Text", "text": "India's steel pipes and tubes industry is poised for strong domestic growth, but with a gradual decline in both imports and exports over the FY 2025–FY 2030 period.
