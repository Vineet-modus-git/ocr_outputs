In order to support sustainability, we have installed a captive solar photovoltaic plant with a capacity of 5.5 MW at Orikottai village, Thiruvadanai Taluka, Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu, India. Further, to align with environmental responsibilities and contribute to green energy solutions, we have adopted compressed biogas ("CBG") as a replacement for conventional furnace oil in our production process. This initiative reduces dependence on fossil fuels and supports cleaner energy usage. As a result, we have been acknowledged as one of the pioneers in sustainable industrial practices by Indian Oil Corporation Limited ("IOCL") (Source: D&B Report).
