Government of India has taken a target to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy by 45% and reduce the total projected carbon emission by 1 billion tonnes by 2030. The ultimate objective is to achieve a net-zero emissions target by the year 2070. The use of natural gas is also expected to receive significant impetus from the Government's commitment towards clean energy under COP26. This is facilitated by the infrastructure based on One Nation One Grid policy.

This policy will also facilitate the growth of transmission lines, where the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has projected that India will need to add about 50,000 circuit kilometers (ckm) of transmission lines by 2029-30 to meet the growing renewable energy capacity. This expansion is vital for ensuring that the grid can handle increased loads and variable energy sources.

## City Gas Distribution

The CGD network in India has expanded significantly in the past decade. As on December 2022, post completion of 11A CGD bidding round, 295 Geographical Areas (GAs) covering about 98% of the population and 88% of total geographical area of the country spread over around 630 districts in 28 States/UTs including all cities under these GAs, have been covered under the CGD network.

As of September 2024, there are 7,259 CNG stations, 13.64 million domestic piped natural gas connections (PNG), 43,281 commercial PNG connections and 19,669 industrial PNG connections. This infrastructure keeps growing which directly has an influence on the demand for steel pipes and tubes.

## Construction Industry

The construction sector and real estate development are significant drivers of demand for steel pipes and tubes in India. The industry can be further segmented into four sub-sections – housing, commercial, retail and hospitality. Of these, the residential segment contributes a majority share in the overall sector. The growth of the overall real estate industry also depends upon the growth in the corporate environment and the demand for office space, urban and semi-urban accommodations.

Construction in the residential sector witnessed a slowdown during the pandemic, but bounced back within two years post-pandemic. The push for affordable housing leads to a surge in construction projects, which inherently increases the demand for various construction materials, including steel pipes and tubes. These materials are essential for plumbing, HVAC systems, and structural applications within residential buildings. To support this trend, both private housing developers and government policies are keen on increasing the number of household units in the country to accommodate the influx of population due to rapid urbanization.

The Indian government has implemented several incentives designed to promote construction across various sectors, particularly focusing on infrastructure development, housing, and sustainable practices. These policies drive demand for construction and infrastructure development.
