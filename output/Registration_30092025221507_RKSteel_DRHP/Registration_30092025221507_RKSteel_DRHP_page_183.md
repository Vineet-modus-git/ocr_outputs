expected to be commissioned by FY25, while the East Coast Corridor, East-West Corridor and North-South Corridor are under the planning stage.

Additionally, Railways Station Redevelopment Programme which was launched in February 2017 to modernize the infrastructure across the nation will enhance the experience of the passengers by providing concept of intelligent building, and state of the art facilities. For this, the Government has launched 'Amrit Bharat Station Scheme' where in a total of 1,275 railway stations under 32 different states have been identified for development. This will further boost the demand for steel pipes in the economy.

Under the National Rail Plan (NRP), the railway's share in freight transport is expected to increase to 45% by 2030 from existing 26%. This implies that the total freight transported by Indian Railways will increase to 3,000 million tonnes by FY2027 and 3,600 million tonnes by FY2030 from 1,418 million tonnes in FY2022. Further, railway freight traffic measured in Net Tonne Kilometres (NTKM) is expected to double to 1,695 billion NKTM by FY2027 from 820 billion NKTM in FY2022.

## Metro Rail Network

Metro rail coaches and network has high dependence on steel tubes and pipes, where an increasing expansion of this network is a direct influence to the demand for steel tubes and pipes.

The Union Budget 2024-25 allocated approximately INR249.32 billion for metro rail and Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) projects, marking a 7.8% increase from the previous year. This funding is crucial for expanding metro networks across various cities. As of December 2024, Metro Rail network in India is operational for around 900Km across 23 cities. This is world's third largest network next only to China and the U.S.

Apart from these operational lines, nearly 970 Km is under construction across 28 cities, which could make the country world's second largest network.

In FY25, government has approved many new metro line projects including:

* Bengaluru Metro Phase-3: Estimated cost of INR 156.11 billion.
* Thane Integral Ring Metro: Estimated cost of INR 122 billion.
* Pune Metro Extension: Estimated cost of INR 29.54 billion.

The list of under construction metro lines, which directly creates demand for steel pipes and tubes are:
