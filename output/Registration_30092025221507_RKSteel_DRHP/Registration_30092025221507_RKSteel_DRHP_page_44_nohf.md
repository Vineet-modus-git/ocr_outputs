Notes:

1. Total income means aggregate of Revenue from operations and Other Income.
2. Revenue from Operations represents the income generated by the Company from its core operating activities. This gives information regarding the scale of operations.
3. Other Income is the income generated by the Company from its non core operations
4. EBITDA means Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, which has been arrived at by obtaining the profit before tax/ (loss) for the year / period and adding back interest cost, depreciation, and amortization expense.
5. EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA as a percentage of revenue from operations.
6. Profit for the year/period represents the restated profits of the Company after deducting all expenses.
7. PAT Margin (%) is calculated as Profit for the year/period as a percentage of Revenue from Operations.
8. Cash Flow from Operating Activities represents the net cash generated or used by a company's core business operations during the year.
9. Cash Flow from Investing Activities reflects the cash spent on or received from investments in assets like property, equipment, or securities during the year
10. Cash Flow from Financing Activities shows the cash inflows and outflows related to borrowing, repaying debt, issuing shares, or paying dividends during the year.
11. Net Worth is computed as Equity Share Capital plus Other Equity
12. Debt - equity ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by total equity. Total debt represents long - term and short - term borrowings. Total equity is the sum of share capital and reserves & surplus and NCI.
13. Return on Equity is calculated by dividing PAT by average shareholders' equity, indicating how effectively a company uses equity to generate profit.
14. Return on capital employed calculated as Earnings before interest and taxes divided by capital employed as at the end of respective period/year. (Capital employed calculated as the aggregate value of total equity, total debt and reduced by Intangible assets)
15. Return on Assets (ROA) is calculated by dividing PAT by total assets.
16. Interest coverage ratio is calculated as EBIT divided by Finance cost
17. Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio is computed as revenue from operations divided by net fixed assets
18. Working Capital Days is derived from (Working Capital ÷ Sales) × 365.
19. Net Asset Value per Share is calculated as total assets reduced by total liabilities divided by the number of outstanding shares at the end of the year.

Correspondingly, our EBITDA margin declined from 5.83% in Fiscal 2024 to 4.21% in Fiscal 2025, and our PAT margin reduced from 2.22% in Fiscal 2024 to 0.95% in Fiscal 2025, reflecting contraction in profitability margins despite an increase in revenue.

The decline in EBITDA and PAT in Fiscal 2025, despite an increase in revenue from operations, was primarily attributable to a combination of operational and financial factors. Cost of materials consumed, which represents a significant portion of our total expenses, increased during Fiscal 2025 due to higher input prices and production volumes. The increase in input costs could not be entirely passed on to customers, leading to compression in gross margins. Purchase of Stock-in-Trade increased from
