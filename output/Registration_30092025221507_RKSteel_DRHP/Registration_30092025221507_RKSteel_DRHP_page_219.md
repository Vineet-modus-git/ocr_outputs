We follow a structured and integrated process to produce high-quality steel tubes and pipes. Each stage of the manufacturing process is designed to ensure efficiency, quality, and consistency in production. The following is a detailed overview of the various stages involved:

**1. Raw Material Procurement**

The process begins with the procurement of raw material (HRCoils) from trusted suppliers. These coils serve as the primary input for manufacturing and are sourced based on the required specifications, including thickness, width, and material grade. Once received, the coils are inspected for defects before being sent for further processing.

**2. Coil Slitting**

In this stage, the large steel coils are passed through slitting machines to cut them into narrower strips according to the required dimensions. This process is crucial in ensuring that the steel strips are the correct width for the next stages of processing.

*Quality Check:* After slitting, the strips undergo a thorough quality inspection to check for precision in width and any irregularities.

*Dispatch:* Approved slitted coils are either sent for further processing or dispatched for use in other applications.

**3. Acid Pickling**

To remove scale, rust, and other impurities from the steel surface, the slit coils undergo acid pickling. In this process, the steel strips are immersed in a series of acid baths to clean the surface and prepare them for subsequent processing. This ensures that the material is free from oxidation, which can affect its mechanical properties.

*Quality Check:* The cleaned coils are inspected to ensure complete removal of impurities.

*Dispatch:* Once approved, the coils are either sent for cold rolling or dispatched for external applications.

**4. Cold Rolling**

Pickled coils that require thickness reduction and improved mechanical properties undergo cold rolling. This process involves passing the steel strips through rollers under high pressure to reduce thickness and enhance tensile strength.

*Quality Check:* The rolled coils are measured for accuracy in thickness and surface quality.

*Dispatch:* Finished cold-rolled coils are dispatched for further processing.

**5. Coil Galvanizing**

To enhance corrosion resistance, some steel coils undergo continuous galvanizing, where they are coated with a protective zinc layer. This process involves passing the steel strips through molten zinc, forming a uniform coating that prevents rust and degradation.

*Quality Check:* The galvanized coils are tested for coating thickness and adherence.

*Dispatch:* Approved coils are either stored for later use or sent for tube manufacturing.

**6. Secondary Coil Slitting**
