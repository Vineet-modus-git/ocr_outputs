Despite modest demand growth, numerous capacity expansion plans are underway, potentially exacerbating global oversupply. This could lead to lower capacity utilisation rates, placing further downward pressure on steel prices and industry profitability. Regional demand dynamics remain mixed, while markets in ASEAN and MENA are witnessing robust growth, demand is weakening in China and staying largely stagnant in OECD nations."}, {"bbox": [234, 724, 1499, 920], "category": "Text", "text": "Market competition is increasingly distorted by government subsidies, especially in regions like China, ASEAN, and MENA. Notably, Chinese subsidies represent a significantly larger share of company revenues, reportedly ten times greater than those in OECD countries, encouraging inefficient capacity expansion and investments with limited commercial viability. Concurrently, China's steel exports have surged, sparking a wave of trade defense measures and heightened concerns over circumvention tactics. These developments highlight the pressing need to address non-market practices contributing to global market imbalances."}, {"bbox": [234, 949, 1499, 1080], "category": "Text", "text": "Moreover, the oversupply problem is hindering progress in steel decarbonization.

This steady trend suggests that the rapid growth driven by post-pandemic recovery has tapered off, giving way to a more balanced supply-demand environment. Factors such as slowing industrial expansion in key regions, rising energy costs, and structural adjustments—especially in China's steel sector—are shaping a cautious outlook.

This moderation reflects not only economic uncertainties and high energy costs but also slowing construction demand, rising environmental regulations, and global overcapacity concerns. The trend signals a mature market, increasingly focused on sustainability and efficiency over expansion."}]
