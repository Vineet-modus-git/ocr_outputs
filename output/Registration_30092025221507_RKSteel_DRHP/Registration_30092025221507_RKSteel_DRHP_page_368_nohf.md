(iv) losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)

**Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss**

*Financial assets at amortised cost*

A 'financial asset' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

(a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and

(b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

This category is the most relevant to the Company. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. The Company's financial assets at amortised cost includes trade receivables.

*Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss*

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

This category includes derivative instruments and listed equity investments which the Company had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the right of payment has been established.

*Derecognition*

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

(i) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or

(ii) The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.

*Impairment of financial assets*

The Company recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the
