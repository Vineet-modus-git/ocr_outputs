on the product. RK Steel has been giving 120GSM coated GP products against the industry standard of 70GSM – 80GSM. This higher zinc coating provides longer protection against rusting when compared with its competitors. The company has significantly enhanced its processing methodology, enabling the galvanization of coils up to 3.60MM in thickness—a capability that remains rare in the industry. This technical advancement positions RK Steel to serve a broader range of OEM customers across both South and North India. The company has installed 9 tube mills that allow for faster delivery of pipes and tubes. The objective of RK Steel is to provide 24-hour delivery of pipes to their customers. This also helps RK Steel with lower maintenance cost and production cost which is ultimately passed on to the customer in terms of lower pricing. RK Steel always works on ensuring that its customers are benefitted the most. To align with their commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainable energy solutions, they have integrated Compressed Biogas (CBG) as a substitute for conventional furnace oil in their production process. They are also in the process of installing a Solar Park to fulfill their electrical requirement with green energy. The company has already installed 5.5MW of solar energy and is in the process of installing an additional capacity of 5.5MW. The aim of RK Steel is to become a green steel manufacturer in South India. This transition not only reduces their reliance on fossil fuels but also promotes cleaner energy usage. As a result, they have been recognized by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) as a pioneer in sustainable industrial practices.
