## (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures

### New and amended standards

The accounting policies adopted and methods of computation followed are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for items disclosed below:

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) Amendment Rules 2023 dated 31 March 2023 to amend the following Ind AS which are effective from 01 April 2023.

#### Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements

An entity shall disclose material accounting policy information. Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements

#### Ind AS 8, Accounting policies, Change in Accounting Estimates and Errors

Definition of 'change in account estimate' has been replaced by revised definition of 'accounting estimate'. As per revised definition, accounting estimates are monetary amounts in the financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. An entity develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by the accounting policy. Developing accounting estimates involves the use of judgements or assumptions based on the latest available, reliable information.

An entity may need to change an accounting estimate if changes occur in the circumstances on which the accounting estimate was based or as a result of new information, new developments or more experience. By its nature, a change in an accounting estimate does not relate to prior periods and is not the correction of an error.

#### Deferred tax related to leases and decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities

Ind AS 12, Income Taxes, exempt an entity from recognising a deferred tax asset or liability in particular circumstances. Despite this exemption, an entity shall recognise a deferred tax asset—to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised—and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with:

* (i) right-of-use assets and lease liabilities; and

* (ii) decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities and the corresponding amounts recognised as part of the cost of the related asset.
