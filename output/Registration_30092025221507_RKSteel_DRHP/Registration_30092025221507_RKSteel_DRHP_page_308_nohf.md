Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to equity holders (after adjusting for savings in interest and dividend expenses, net of taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.
