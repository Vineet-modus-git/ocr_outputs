## 3 Summary of material accounting policies

### (a) Current versus non-current classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities based on current/non-current classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:

- Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle.

- Held primarily for the purpose of trading

- Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or

- Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is treated as current when:

- It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle

- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

- It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or

- There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

### (b) Property plant and equipment and Investment property

#### (i) Property plant and equipment

Under the previous GAAP (Indian GAAP), all assets were carried in the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. On transition to Ind-AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value for all of its property and equipment recognized as of April 01, 2022 (date of transition to Ind-AS) measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost as at the date of transition.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises purchase price, cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment, borrowing costs if the recognition criteria are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its location and condition necessary for the intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of those Property, plant and equipment which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised. Other borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Property, plant and equipment under installation or construction as at the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities date is shown as capital work-in-progress and advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities date is classified as capital advance under other Non current assets.

Depreciation is calculated on a Written Down Value method over the useful life and in the manner prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. However, where the Management's estimate of the remaining useful life of the assets on a review subsequent to the time of acquisition is different, then depreciation is provided over the remaining useful life based on the revised useful life. As the nature and use of the solar plant is distinguishable from other plant and machinery, it is classified as a separate class of asset. To reflect the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity, it is depreciated under the Straight Line method.
