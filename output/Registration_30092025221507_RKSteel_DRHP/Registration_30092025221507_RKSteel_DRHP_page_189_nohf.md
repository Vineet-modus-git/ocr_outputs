sector.

The policy aligns with significant investments in infrastructure development, which is a major consumer of steel products. Enhanced infrastructure projects, such as roads, railways, and housing, are expected to drive demand for steel.

The introduction of the PLI scheme under Atmanirbhar Bharat aims to incentivize manufacturers to increase production and enhance quality standards. This scheme is expected to create new avenues for growth in the steel sector.

This initiative also addresses concerns regarding surges in steel imports, particularly from countries like China. Industry stakeholders have raised alarms about predatory pricing and unfair competition, urging for trade remedial actions to protect domestic producers.

In steel tubes and pipes sector, the demand for seamless and ERW pipe sectors is increasing because of these policies. According to this policy, any purchases made by PSUs must include at least 35% local value addition in the supply of pipes. This will eventually support domestic manufacturers in the country.

Under this policy, a stimulus of Rs. 20 lakh crore was announced by the Government to aid the country to fight against Covid-19 pandemic.

The Atmanirbhar Bharat Policy represents a strategic approach to achieving self-reliance in the steel sector by focusing on production targets, promoting domestic manufacturing, investing in infrastructure, and encouraging sustainable practices. By addressing challenges related to imports and fostering a conducive environment for growth, this initiative aims to strengthen India's position as a global leader in steel production while ensuring that local industries thrive.

## Production-Linked Incentive Scheme

* The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the Steel Sector in India, specifically targeting specialty steel, was introduced to enhance domestic manufacturing capabilities, reduce import dependency, and promote the production of high-value-added steel products

* The PLI scheme for specialty steel was announced in July 2021 with a budgetary outlay of INR 6,322 crore (approximately USD 848.93 million) over a five-year period.

* The scheme aims to boost the production of specialty steel from 18 million tonnes (MT) in FY2021 to 42 MT by FY2027.

* By increasing local production, the policy seeks to decrease India's reliance on imported specialty steel, which accounted for a significant portion of total imports. The PLI scheme is designed to make Indian steel products more competitive both domestically and internationally.

* The scheme focuses on five categories of specialty steel:

* Coated/plated steel products

* High strength / wear-resistant steel

* Speciality rails

* Alloy steel products and steel wires

* Electrical steel

* The incentives under the PLI scheme vary based on the category of specialty steel produced, with rates ranging from 4% to 12% on incremental sales.

* Any company registered in India that manufactures the identified grades of specialty steel can apply for the incentives. A key requirement is that the input materials must be melted or poured in India to ensure end-to-end manufacturing within the country.

* 67 applications from 30 companies have been selected under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Specialty Steel. This will attract committed investment of INR 425 billion (USD 5.19 billion) with a downstream capacity addition of 26 million tonnes and employment generation potential of 70,000.

* The PLI scheme aims to benefit both large integrated steel producers and smaller manufacturers, particularly Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), by providing them access to high-quality specialty steel products at competitive prices.

* By promoting the production of specialty steel, India aims to align itself with advanced steel-making
