This divergence indicates an increasing demand for value-added products such as coated, precision, or customized tubes used in specialized applications like automotive, construction machinery, and energy transmission. Additionally, rising input costs, including iron ore, energy, and logistics, are likely to contribute to a higher average selling price (ASP) across the forecast period, further inflating market value."}, {"bbox": [233, 1430, 1500, 1628], "category": "Text", "text": "The relatively faster growth in consumption compared to production suggests a gradual narrowing of the supply-demand gap. This implies that demand centers—especially in emerging economies in Asia, Africa, and parts of Latin America—are ramping up their usage of steel tubes faster than their domestic output, potentially creating new trade opportunities or investments in local production. At the same time, developed markets like North America and Europe may witness slower volume growth but a significant shift toward high-specification and sustainable products, backed by stricter regulatory standards and industrial upgrades."}, {"bbox": [233, 1655, 1500, 1849], "category": "Text", "text": "Moreover, with the global push toward infrastructure modernization, energy transition (such as pipelines for hydrogen and natural gas), and clean mobility, the industry is likely to witness a transformation in product requirements and supply chain dynamics.
