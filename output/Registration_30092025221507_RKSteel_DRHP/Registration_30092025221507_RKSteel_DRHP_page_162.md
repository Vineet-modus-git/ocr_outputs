foreign steel for consumption with relatively lower outbound trade.

Another notable insight is the role of emerging and mid-sized economies such as Mexico, Thailand, and the UAE. While Mexico ranks sixth in total imports (17.6 million tonnes), it ranks third in net imports at 14.3 million tonnes, indicating limited re-export or domestic production to offset imports. A similar pattern appears with Thailand and the Philippines, both of which have moderate import volumes but rank high in net imports. This suggests rising domestic demand driven by construction, infrastructure, and manufacturing growth, but an underdeveloped domestic steel industry that remains heavily dependent on imports.

On the other hand, traditional industrial powers like Germany, Italy, and South Korea feature high in total imports but are absent from the net import top 10. This suggests a strong balance between imports and exports. These nations likely act as both major consumers and processors or re-exporters of steel. This dynamic points to competitive domestic industries with established steel production and value-added processing capabilities. It also highlights the strategic role these countries play in global steel supply chains not just as end users, but as key players in trade, production, and distribution.

## Indian Steel Industry

India continues to stand out as a key growth market in the global steel sector, with steel demand projected to rise by 8.5% in CY 2025, significantly outpacing the global average of 1.2%, as per the latest Short-Range Outlook by the World Steel Association. Since 2021, India has consistently led global steel demand growth, and this momentum is expected to persist into 2025. The anticipated surge is being driven by sustained expansion across all major steel-consuming industries, particularly infrastructure, where ongoing public and private investments are playing a crucial role. This positions India as a major contributor to global steel market stability amid slower growth elsewhere.

India's crude steel production witnessed a 5.3% year-on-year increase in FY 2024-25, rising from 144.30 million tonnes to 151.97 million tonnes, while finished steel production grew by 5.3% to reach 146.56 million tonnes. This growth reflects the sector's strong response to rising demand from infrastructure, construction, engineering goods, and capital equipment segments. Additionally, capacity additions by major steel producers, improved plant utilization rates, and technological upgrades have contributed to the consistent rise in output. Government-led capital expenditure programs and investments in railways, roads, and housing also created a steady demand base, justifying sustained production momentum.

Steel consumption in FY 2024-25 rose sharply by 11.5% to 152.00 million tonnes from 136.29 million tonnes in the previous fiscal, outpacing both crude and finished steel production growth. This indicates a strong post-pandemic recovery in industrial activity and a demand-led pull across sectors like real estate, manufacturing, and clean energy projects. Additionally, increased offtake by MSMEs, coupled with rural demand in sectors like agri-infrastructure and warehousing, further accelerated consumption. The widening gap between consumption and production also points to temporary import dependency or inventory drawdown, highlighting the need for further capacity augmentation and supply chain efficiency to meet domestic needs more effectively.

## Domestic Production & Consumption Scenario

India's crude steel production has demonstrated steady growth over recent years, driven by rising infrastructure development, industrial expansion, and government initiatives like the National Steel Policy and Make in India. The country has emerged as the world's second-largest steel producer, with consistent investments in capacity expansion, modernization of existing plants, and enhanced raw material security.
