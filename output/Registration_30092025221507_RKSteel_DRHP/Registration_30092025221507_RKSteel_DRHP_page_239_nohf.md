* Sale: The transfer of ownership in property for a price, paid or promised to be paid.

* Mortgage: The transfer of an interest in property for the purpose of securing the payment of a loan, existing or future debt, or performance of an engagement which gives rise to a pecuniary liability. The T.P. Act recognises several forms of mortgages over a property.

* Charges: Transactions including the creation of security over property for payment of money to another which are not classifiable as a mortgage. Charges can be created either by operation of law, e.g. decree of the court attaching to specified immovable property, or by an act of the parties.

* Leases: The transfer of a right to enjoy property for consideration paid or rendered periodically or on specified occasions.

* Leave and License: The transfer of a right to do something upon immovable property without creating interest in the property.
