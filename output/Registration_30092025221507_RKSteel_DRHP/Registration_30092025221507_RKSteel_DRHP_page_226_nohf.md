**Power** - We require continuous power supply for manufacturing our products and to meet our requirements. The requirement of power is met by supply of electricity by state grid.

Additionally, our Company has also set up captive solar plant with an aggregate installed capacity of 5.5 MW at Orikottai village, Thiruvadanai taluka, Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu, India, as of September, 2024 to utilize non-conventional energy sources which enable us to reduce our operating costs.

Further, to align with environmental responsibilities and contribute to green energy solutions, we have adopted compressed biogas ("CBG") as a replacement for conventional furnace oil in our production process. The details of solar power plant of the Company is as follows;

The Solar Power plant is operated by third parties entities on our behalf. The power generated by them at these sites is transmitted by state grid to the distribution network of our principal energy supplier namely Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited. The amount of power transmitted to Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited is thereby adjusted against the power consumed by us and reduced from our monthly bill. This leads to a reduction in power costs.

**Water** – The requirements are fully met through SIPCOT supply of water.
