New entrants must be prepared to invest significantly to set up production capabilities that meet industry standards. Additionally, the industry requires a high level of working capital to run operations smoothly. As this is a credit-based industry, companies need to make considerable investments in extending credit to customers, further adding to the overall capital requirement.\n\n* **Approval and Certification Processes**\n\nGaining approval from clients is essential in this industry, especially for applications in sectors like oil and gas, where product reliability is crucial. New companies must navigate a lengthy approval process to demonstrate compliance with quality and safety standards, including obtaining mandatory government certifications such as BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization). These requirements demand significant investment and can be a major barrier to entry.\n\n* **Technological Complexity**\n\nThe production of steel pipes involves advanced manufacturing processes that require specialized knowledge and expertise. New entrants may struggle to acquire the necessary technology or develop the expertise needed to produce high-quality products consistently.\n\n* **Customization Requirement**\n\nMany applications for steel pipes require significant customization to meet specific client needs or industry standards. This necessity complicates the production process and may require additional"}]
