there can be no assurance that future delays or lapses will not occur. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulatory filing requirements in a timely manner may subject us to warnings, penalties, or reputational risks, all of which could adversely affect our operations or delay future corporate actions.

22. **In addition to revenue derived from our manufacturing activity, we also derive revenue from trading of steel coils and sheets, which may expose us to risks distinct from our manufacturing business.**

In addition to revenue generated from our manufacturing activity, we also derive a portion of our revenue from trading of steel coils and sheets. Our revenue from operations attributable to manufacturing was ₹1,03,762.19 lakhs, ₹1,00,325.21 lakhs and ₹84,744.25 lakhs in Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, representing 90.40%, 98.15% and 100% of our revenue from operations, respectively, while revenue from trading was ₹11,017.14 lakhs and ₹1,890.79 lakhs representing 9.60% and 1.85% of our revenue from operations in the same periods.

Our trading income primarily arises from trading of HRCoils, which are also a primary raw material for our welded pipes and tubes. These coils are typically sold to small manufacturers who are unable to place advance orders and maintain inventory, or to manufacturers requiring material for small order quantities. In addition, we also supply these coils to sheet suppliers and other PEB manufacturers in the region. The trading activity exposes us to risks distinct from our manufacturing business, including volatility in raw material prices, thin trading margins, counterparty risks, and fluctuations in short-term demand.

Further, since HR coils are also a key raw material for our own manufacturing operations, diversion of inventory for trading purposes may affect our ability to meet internal production requirements if procurement is not effectively managed. In addition, trading does not allow us to exercise the same degree of control over quality and value addition as in our manufacturing activity and therefore may be more susceptible to price-based competition.

There can be no assurance that our trading income will continue to contribute to our overall revenues at the same levels as in prior periods, or that demand from small manufacturers, sheet suppliers, or PEB manufacturers will remain stable. Any decline in our trading income, inability to manage risks associated with trading activity, or adverse movement in raw material prices could negatively affect our overall revenue, profitability, and financial performance.

23. **The steel pipes and tubes market in India faces several threats and challenges that can impact its growth and long-term competitiveness.**

The steel pipes and tubes market in India faces several threats and challenges that can impact its growth and long-term competitiveness. These challenges are structural and market-driven in nature and may adversely affect industry players across the value chain.

According to the D&B Report, the market is significantly affected by stiff competition from imported steel pipes, particularly from countries with established manufacturing capabilities and cost advantages. In FY2024, steel pipes and tubes imported from China, Korea, and Vietnam accounted for nearly 70% of total import volume. This influx of cheaper imports exerts downward pressure on domestic prices, impacting the profitability of Indian manufacturers and challenging the revenue growth of the domestic market. The high dependence on low-cost imports limits the growth opportunities for domestic participants and poses risks to capacity utilization and investment plans.

The D&B Report also highlights that the growing availability of alternative materials, especially PVC and plastic pipes, also presents a credible substitution risk for steel pipes, particularly in non-critical applications. These alternatives are often perceived as more cost-effective and easier to install, making them attractive in a price-sensitive market like India. As the penetration of PVC and plastic pipes increases, the demand for conventional steel pipes may be further constrained.

As per D&B Report, from an export perspective, environmental compliance costs are emerging as a key barrier. Indian steel manufacturers and finished steel product exporters to the European Union are subject to a carbon tax of 25% to 30%, unless they reduce emissions to meet prescribed thresholds.
