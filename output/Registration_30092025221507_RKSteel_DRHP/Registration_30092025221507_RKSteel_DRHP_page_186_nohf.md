# Regulatory Scenario

## Regulatory Policy/Initiative Impacting Steel Pipe & Tube Industry in India

The regulatory policies and initiatives impacting the steel pipe and tube industry in India are primarily driven by standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), government initiatives, and compliance with international norms.

* **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Regulations**

The BIS plays a crucial role in establishing quality standards for steel pipes and tubes. These standards ensure that manufacturers comply with quality and safety requirements, promoting consumer confidence in products. Recent notifications include:

* **IS 17875:** Specification for Stainless Steel Seamless Pipes and Tubes for General Services, established on April 19, 2022.

* **IS 17876:** Specification for Stainless Steel Welded Pipes and Tubes for General Services, also established on April 19, 2022.

* **IS 1239, IS 4923, IS 3601, IS 1161, IS 1875:** Specification for Stainless Steel Electric Resistant Welded (ERW) Pipes and Tubes for General Services, also established on April 19, 2022.

* **Quality Control Orders (QCO)**

* The Ministry of Steel has implemented Quality Control Orders that mandate compliance with specific Indian Standards for various steel products, including pipes and tubes.

* This initiative aims to ensure that only high-quality products enter the market, enhancing overall safety and reliability.

* This order bans sub-standard/ defective steel products supplied to the market both from the domestic & by imports to ensure the availability of quality steel to the industry. This measure is taken to enhance the availability of quality steel to the users. According to the Order, it is ensured that only quality steel conforming to the relevant BIS standards is made available to the end users.

* As of March 2024, the QCO covers an overall 550 products, including 145 categories of steel and steel products including carbon steel, alloy steel and stainless steel. In addition, goods & articles made up of steel such as stainless-steel pipe & tubes, laminations/ cores of transformers, products of tin plate & tin free steel etc have also been notified to prevent circumvention of the Steel Quality Control Order.

* **Environmental Regulations**

The steel industry is subject to environmental regulations that govern emissions and waste management. Compliance with these regulations is essential for sustainable operations and can influence production practices within the MS pipe sector. The prominent environmental regulations in place includes:

* **Emission Standards** – The steel industry is subject to strict emission norms set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control boards. These regulations aim to limit air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from steel manufacturing processes.

* **Energy Efficiency Regulations** – The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) promotes energy conservation in industrial processes, including steel production. Manufacturers are encouraged to adopt energy-efficient technologies and practices to reduce overall energy consumption and carbon footprint.

* **National Steel Policy (2017)** – This policy emphasizes sustainable development in the steel sector, promoting cleaner technologies and practices. It encourages the use of electric arc furnaces (EAF) and other methods that minimize environmental degradation compared to traditional blast furnace methods.

* **Recycling Initiatives** – The Indian government supports recycling initiatives that encourage the use of scrap metal in steel production. This not only reduces reliance on virgin raw materials but also lowers energy consumption and emissions associated with steel manufacturing.
