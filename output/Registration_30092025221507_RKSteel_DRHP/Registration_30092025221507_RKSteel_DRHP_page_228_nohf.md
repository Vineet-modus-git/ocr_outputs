## INSURANCE

Our operations are subject to risks inherent to manufacturing operations. In order to manage the risk of losses from potentially harmful events, we maintain insurance policies such as corporate cover, industrial all risk, insurance covering solar power plant. In addition, our Company has also obtained insurances for the vehicles being used by the Company. These insurance policies are renewed periodically to ensure adequate coverage. We believe that our insurance coverage is in accordance with industry customs, including the terms of and the coverage provided by such insurances. Our policies are subject to standard limitations. Therefore, insurance might not necessarily cover all losses incurred by us and we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur losses or suffer claims beyond the limits of, or outside the relevant coverage of, our insurance policies.
