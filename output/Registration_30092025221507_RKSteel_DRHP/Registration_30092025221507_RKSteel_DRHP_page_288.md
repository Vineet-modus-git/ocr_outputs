(All amounts in Rs. lakhs, except as otherwise stated)

(h) **Revenue recognition**

Revenue is recognized based on Ind AS 115, which states that revenue needs to be recognized when an entity transfers the control of goods and services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled. Ind AS 115 is based on a five-step model:

1) Identify the contract with the customer

2) Identify the performance obligations

3) Determine the transaction price

4) Allocate the transaction price

5) Recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied

**Operating Income**

The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of steel products. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery or as per agreement with the customers. The estimation of total production or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed continuously throughout the contract period to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. The Company recognises revenue at point in time.

Any change in scope or price is considered as a contract modification. The Company accounts for variable considerations like, volume discounts, rebates and pricing incentives to customers as reduction of revenue on a systematic and rational basis over the period of the contract. Revenues are shown net of allowances/ returns, goods and services tax and applicable discounts and allowances.

**Interest Income**

For all debt instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss.

Interest income is recognized on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate. Interest income is included under the head "finance income" in the statement of profit and loss.

**Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognized when the Company's right to receive dividend is established by the reporting date.

**Contract balances**

*Trade receivables*

A receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due).

*Advance from Customers*

Advance from Customers is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs its obligation under the contract.

(i) **Foreign currencies**

Items included in the restated Ind AS summary statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (i.e. the "functional currency"). The Company's restated Ind AS summary statements are presented in Rs., which is also the Company's functional and presentation currency.

*Transactions and balances*

Foreign currency transactions are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. However, for practical reasons, the Company uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Non-monetary items, which are measured in terms of historical cost denominated in a foreign currency, are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on reporting monetary items of Company at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded during the year, or reported in previous financial statements, are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which they arise.
