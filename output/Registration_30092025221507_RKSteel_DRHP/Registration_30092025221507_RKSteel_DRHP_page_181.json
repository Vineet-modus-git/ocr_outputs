This sector encompasses a wide range of applications including potable water supply systems (treatment plants, overhead tanks, and distribution pipelines), sewage networks, stormwater drainage, irrigation systems, and large-scale storage facilities such as reservoirs and dams. Steel pipes, particularly galvanised and seamless variants, are widely preferred for their durability, resistance to corrosion, and ability to withstand high pressure—qualities essential for both urban and rural water distribution systems."}, {"bbox": [235, 1124, 1497, 1319], "category": "Text", "text": "The increasing strain on India's water infrastructure is evident, especially with rapid urbanization and rising per capita water consumption. In rural regions, steel pipes are extensively used in borewells, irrigation canals, and drip irrigation systems to support agricultural productivity. Meanwhile, urban areas are witnessing growing demand for corrosion-resistant piping in sewerage, greywater recycling, and rainwater harvesting systems. The expansion of smart cities and urban utilities is further accelerating investments into high-performance pipeline infrastructure, contributing to the growing usage of ERW and galvanized steel pipes."}, {"bbox": [235, 1347, 1497, 1606], "category": "Text", "text": "A looming water crisis is also pushing structural reforms and technological upgrades in India's groundwater and surface water systems. With projections indicating that water demand will outpace supply by 2030, there's a significant push toward sustainable infrastructure. Programs like the *Atal Bhujal Yojana*—aimed at improving groundwater management through community-led interventions—highlight the urgency. Additionally, new digital monitoring systems, sensor-based water flow controls, and smart metering technologies are emerging, which in turn demand precision-grade steel tubing. As the country intensifies efforts toward efficient and resilient water ecosystems, the role of steel tubes and pipes will continue to deepen, especially in regions facing acute water stress and infrastructural gaps."}, {"bbox": [237, 1602, 1492, 2004], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [631, 2004, 1100, 2056], "category": "Caption", "text": "Source: Ministry of Jal Sakthi, Government of India\n*A=Actual, B=Budgetary"}, {"bbox": [235, 2086, 1497, 2122], "category": "Text", "text": "On 15th August, 2019, “Jal Jeevan Mission” programme has been launched by the Government to provide safe"}]
