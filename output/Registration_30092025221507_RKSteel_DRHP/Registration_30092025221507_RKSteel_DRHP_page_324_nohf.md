*The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

The company has used Level 3 Valuation technique for the Investment in Equity shares Valued by a registered valuer. For some, unquoted equity instruments where the most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements, cost has been considered as the best estimate of fair value.

The Company does not have any financial instruments which are measured at FVTOCI or FVTPL other than mentioned above.

There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the six months as at March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

The Company's management assessed that fair value of cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances, trade receivables, trade payables and other financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
