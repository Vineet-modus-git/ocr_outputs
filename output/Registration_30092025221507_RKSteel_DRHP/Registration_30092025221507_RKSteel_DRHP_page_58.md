impact worker availability and morale, and consequently affect production.

In addition, since certain of our leased properties are held from private individuals, any disputes relating to ownership, title, or enforceability of these leases could expose us to legal proceedings, additional costs, or even loss of possession. Any such disruption in the continuity of our registered office, manufacturing facility, or labor housing arrangements could materially and adversely affect our operations, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

27. We are dependent on our trademarks for brand recognition, and any failure to obtain or maintain trademark registrations, or protect our intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our business and reputation.

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has registered and made applications for registration of certain trademarks with the Registrar of Trademarks under the Trademarks Act, 1999.

The details registered mark are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td>Date of Issue</td><td>Particulars of the Mark</td><td>Trade Mark No.</td><td>Class of Registration</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>October 14, 2020</td><td>RKS</td><td>4701777</td><td>06</td></tr><tr><td>October 14, 2020</td><td>XOFLOW RKS</td><td>4701776</td><td>06</td></tr></tbody></table>

The details applications for registration are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td>Date of Application</td><td>Particulars of the Mark</td><td>Application Number</td><td>Class of Registration</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>January 23, 2025</td><td>RK Steel<br>Strong from within</td><td>6820038</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>December 23, 2023</td><td>Jal-Jivan RKS</td><td>6232077</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table>

We believe that our trademarks are important to establish our brand identity and market presence. However, there can be no assurance that our pending applications will be granted in a timely manner, or at all, or that the registrations already granted will not be successfully challenged, opposed, or cancelled by third parties. Further, third parties may use marks similar to ours, which could dilute our brand value or cause confusion among customers.

Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to enforcement under applicable law, which may be uncertain, time-consuming, and costly. Any failure to obtain or maintain registrations for our trademarks, or to enforce our rights against infringement, passing off, or misuse, may adversely affect our business, brand recognition, goodwill, and reputation. Moreover, if we are compelled to engage in legal proceedings to protect or defend our trademarks, we may incur substantial costs and management time, with no assurance of a favourable outcome.

Accordingly, any inability to secure, maintain, or enforce our trademark rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

28. We are exposed to credit risk from our customers, and the recoverability of our trade receivables is subject to uncertainties, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

We generally extend credit periods to our customers, which exposes us to credit risk and creates
