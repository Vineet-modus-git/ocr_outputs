## Financial risk management (Continued)

### B. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to financial loss. The credit risk arises principally from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with banks and NBFC and other financial instruments.

#### (i) Trade receivables:

The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade receivables that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to past payment history, security by way of deposits, external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash flow projections and available press information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement. The maximum exposure to credit risk as at reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to March 31, 2025: Rs. 145.17 Lakhs, March 31, 2024: Rs. 6.04 Lakhs and March 31, 2023: Rs. 0.59 lakhs. The movement in allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>As at March 31,<br>2025</th><th>As at March 31,<br>2024</th><th>As at March 31,<br>2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Opening balance</td><td>6.05</td><td>0.59</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Reversed during the year</td><td>139.12</td><td>5.45</td><td>0.59</td></tr><tr><td>Provision during the year</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Closing balance</td><td>145.17</td><td>6.04</td><td>0.59</td></tr></tbody></table>

The Company establishes an allowance account for impairment, which represents its estimate of losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The allowance account is used to provide for impairment losses. Subsequently, when the Company is satisfied that recovery of such losses is not possible, the financial asset is considered irrecoverable, and the amount charged to the allowance account is written off against the carrying amount of the impaired financial asset.

#### (ii) Security deposit:

There is no significant concentration of credit risk and no single vendor accounted for more than 10% of the total deposits as of March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

#### (iv) Other financial assets:

The Company holds Margin money of March 31, 2025: Rs.120 lakhs March 31, 2024: Rs. 744.74 lakhs and March 31, 2023: Rs. 438.45 lakhs. The fixed deposits with bank in March 31, 2025: Rs. 4540 Lakhs: March 31, 2024: Rs. 4566.26 lakhs and March 31, 2023: Rs. 2112.16 lakhs. The cash and cash equivalents and fixed deposits with bank are mainly held with scheduled banks which are highly regulated. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents and fixed deposits with bank have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of counterparties.
