in 2024 signifies India's transition toward a more urbanized and industrialized economy, although still trailing the global average of ~230–240 kg, highlighting substantial room for growth.

Looking ahead, as India moves toward its USD 5 trillion GDP target, per capita steel consumption is projected to rise further, supported by mega infrastructure projects, growing real estate needs, rapid urban expansion, and a stronger focus on logistics and manufacturing competitiveness. To sustain this momentum, ensuring adequate domestic production capacity, improving supply chains, and promoting low-carbon steel technologies will be critical.

## Crude Steel Production :

In the Indian steel industry, key integrated producers—comprising Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), Tata Steel Group (TSL), ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AM/NS), JSW Steel (JSWL), and Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSPL)—accounted for **86.22 million tonnes** of crude steel production, representing **57%** of the total national output. However, the year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth in production from these major players was a modest **0.4%**, indicating a near stagnation in capacity expansion or operational output during the period. This slowdown could be attributed to factors such as maintenance shutdowns, global price corrections, or cautious production strategies amid economic uncertainties.

Conversely, **other players**—mainly comprising secondary producers, mini-mills, and re-rollers—contributed a significant **65.75 million tonnes**, reflecting a robust **12.6%** Y-o-Y growth. This rapid expansion among non-integrated producers suggests a growing decentralization of steel production in India. It also highlights the agility of small and mid-sized units in ramping up production to meet rising domestic demand, especially in regional markets and construction-led segments. The strong growth in this segment is a clear indicator of India's maturing steel ecosystem, where smaller players are becoming increasingly relevant in the supply chain.

## Finished Steel Production

In finished steel, the same group of leading steel manufacturers accounted for **80.05 million tonnes**, or **55%** of total output. This segment witnessed a **2.3%** Y-o-Y growth from the top producers—an improvement over crude steel growth but still moderate when compared to the surge in overall demand. This suggests that while large players maintained stable output, they may have prioritized higher value-added products, downstream integration, or export diversification over volume growth. Given the increase in consumption in FY 2025, this limited
