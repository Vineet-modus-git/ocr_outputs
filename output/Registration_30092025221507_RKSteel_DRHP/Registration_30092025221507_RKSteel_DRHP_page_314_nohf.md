## 44 Employee benefit plan (Continued)

### Sensitivity analysis

Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below:

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan="3">0.5% Increase</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>As at<br>31 March 2025</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2024</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Discount rate</th><td>-5.33%</td><td>-5.25%</td><td>-4.84%</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Future salary growth</th><td>4.80%</td><td>4.73%</td><td>3.95%</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Attrition rate</th><td>-0.43%</td><td>-0.66%</td><td>-0.70%</td></tr></tbody><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan="3">0.5% Decrease</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>As at<br>31 March 2025</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2024</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Discount rate</th><td>6.18%</td><td>6.08%</td><td>5.50%</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Future salary growth</th><td>-4.37%</td><td>-4.16%</td><td>-3.67%</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Attrition rate</th><td>0.41%</td><td>0.66%</td><td>0.71%</td></tr></tbody></table>

The estimates of future salary increases, considered actuarial valuation, takes into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employment market. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur. TN isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Restated Ind AS Summary Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

The average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting year ended March 2025 is 11 years (March 31, 2024: 11 years and March 31, 2023: 11 years)

### d) Risk exposure:

Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which is detailed below:

#### Inflation risk:

Gratuity payments are based on last drawn salary of the employee, increase in inflation will increase the future salary of employees, thus resulting in increase in projected benefit obligation.
