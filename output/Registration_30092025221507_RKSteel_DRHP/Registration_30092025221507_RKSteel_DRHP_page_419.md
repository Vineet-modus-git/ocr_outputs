**Joint Holders**

Subject to the provisions of the Articles of Association, where two or more persons are registered as the holders of the Equity Shares, they will be deemed to hold such Equity Shares as joint tenants with benefits of survivorship.

**Nomination facility to Bidders**

In accordance with Section 72 of the Companies Act 2013, read with Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, as amended, the sole Bidder, or the first Bidder along with other joint Bidders, may nominate any one person in whom, in the event of the death of sole Bidder or in case of joint Bidders, death of all the Bidders, as the case may be, the Equity Shares Allotted, if any, shall vest, to the exclusion of all other persons, unless the nomination is modified or cancelled in the prescribed manner. A person, being a nominee, entitled to the Equity Shares by reason of the death of the original holder(s), shall be entitled to the same advantages to which he or she would be entitled if he or she were the registered holder of the Equity Share(s). Where the nominee is a minor, the holder(s) may make a nomination to appoint, in the prescribed manner, any person to become entitled to Equity Share(s) in the event of his or her death during the minority. A nomination shall stand rescinded upon a sale, transfer or alienation of Equity Share(s) by the person nominating. A nomination may be cancelled or modified by nominating any other person in place of the present nominee, by the holder of the Equity Shares who made the nomination, by giving a notice of such cancellation or variation to our Company. A buyer will be entitled to make a fresh nomination in the manner prescribed. Fresh nomination can be made only on the prescribed form available on request at our Registered Office or to the Registrar and Transfer Agent of our Company.

Any person who becomes a nominee by virtue of Section 72 of the Companies Act 2013, as amended, will, on the production of such evidence as may be required by our Board, elect either:

* to register himself or herself as the holder of the Equity Shares; or

* to make such transfer of the Equity Shares, as the deceased holder could have made.

Further, our Board may at any time give notice requiring any nominee to choose either to be registered himself or herself or to transfer the Equity Shares, and if the notice is not complied with within a period of 90 days, our Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividend, interests, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the Equity Shares, until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

Since the Allotment of Equity Shares in the Issue will be made only in dematerialised form, there is no need to make a separate nomination with our Company. Nominations registered with the respective Depository Participant of the Bidder will prevail. If Bidders want to change their nomination, they are advised to inform their respective Depository Participants.
