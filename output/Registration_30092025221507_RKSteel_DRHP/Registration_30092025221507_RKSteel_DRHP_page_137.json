The presentation of these KPIs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Restated Financial Statement. We use these KPIs to evaluate our financial and operating performance. Some of these KPIs are not defined under Ind AS and are not presented in accordance with Ind AS. These KPIs have limitations as analytical tools. Further, these KPIs may differ from the similar information used by other companies and hence their comparability may be limited. Therefore, these metrics should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to Ind AS measures of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity or results of operation. Although these KPIs are not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards, our management believes that it provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, when taken collectively with financial measures prepared in accordance with Ind AS. Investors are encouraged to review the Ind AS financial measures and to not rely on any single financial or operational metric to evaluate our business."}, {"bbox": [336, 1952, 852, 1981], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Comparison of KPIs with Listed Industry Peers"}]
