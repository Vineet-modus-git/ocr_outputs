## 55 Ratio Analysis and its elements

### i) Current ratio

The current ratio is used to assess a company's short term liquidity. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by current liabilities.

### ii) Debt-equity ratio

"Net Debt" is defined as aggregate of non-current borrowings and current maturities of long term-borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and total equity includes issued capital and all other equity reserves.

### iii) Debt service coverage ratio

The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) measures the ability of a company to use its operating income to repay all its debt obligations, including repayment of principal and interest on both short-term and long-term debt. It is calculated by dividing net operating income by the total debt service (Interest and principal).

### iv) Return on equity ratio

Equal to profit for the year divided by the equity during that period, and is expressed as a percentage.

### v) Inventory turnover ratio

Inventory turnover indicates the rate at which a company sells and replaces its stock of goods during a particular period. The inventory turnover ratio formula is the cost of goods sold divided by the average inventory for the same period.

### vi) Trade receivables turnover ratio

Accounts receivable turnover ratio is calculated by dividing your net credit sales by your average accounts receivable. The ratio is used to measure how effective a company is at extending credits and collecting debts.

### vii) Trade payables turnover ratio

This ratio is used to measure the number of times the business is paying off its creditors or suppliers in an accounting period. It is computed by dividing the net credit purchases by average accounts payable.

### viii) Net capital turnover ratio

It is calculated by dividing annual sales by average stockholder equity (net worth). The ratio indicates how much a company could grow its current capital investment level.

### ix) Net profit ratio

The net profit percentage is the ratio of after-tax profits to net sales. It reveals the remaining profit after all costs of production, administration, and financing have been deducted from sales, and income taxes recognized

### x) Return on capital employed

Return on Capital Employed is calculated by dividing our EBIT during a given period by Capital Employed (tangible net worth, total debt, deferred tax liability) during that period.

### xi) Return on investment

Return on investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. To calculate ROI, the benefit (or return) of an investment is divided by the cost of the investment.
