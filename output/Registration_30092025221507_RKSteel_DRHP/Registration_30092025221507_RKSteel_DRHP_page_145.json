This marks the slowest expansion since 2020 and reflects a -0.5%point downgrade from January 2025 forecast. Moreover, the projection for CY 2026 has also reduced to 3.0%. This slowdown is majorly attributed due to numerous factors such as high inflation in many economies despite central bank effort to curb inflation, continuing energy market volatility driven by geopolitical tensions particularly in Ukraine and Middle East, and the re-election of Donald Trump as US President extended uncertainty around the trade policies as well as overall global economic growth. High inflation and rising borrowing costs affected the private consumption on one hand while fiscal consolidation impacted the government consumption on the other hand. As a result, global GDP growth is estimated to moderation by 2.8% in CY 2025 as compared to 3.3% in CY 2024."}, {"bbox": [238, 1447, 1494, 1832], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [612, 1830, 1118, 1857], "category": "Text", "text": "Source – IMF Global GDP Forecast Release April 2025"}, {"bbox": [235, 1888, 1499, 2018], "category": "Text", "text": "Note: Advanced Economies and Emerging & Developing Economies are as per the classification of the World Economic Outlook (WEO).
