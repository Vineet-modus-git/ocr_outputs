uncertainties regarding the timely realization of our trade receivables. The details of our average trade receivables and trade receivable turnover days for Fiscals 2025, 2024, and 2023 are set forth below:

A customer's ability to make timely payments depends on multiple factors, including general economic conditions, liquidity constraints, and their internal cash flows, all of which are beyond our control. Such circumstances could cause our customers to delay payments, renegotiate credit terms, or default on payment obligations, resulting in an increase in our outstanding receivables.

Our ability to collect payments is also linked to timely completion of our contractual obligations and accurate invoicing. If we fail to meet contractual commitments or if there are disputes over quality, quantity, or delivery timelines, our receivables may be delayed or remain unpaid. Any such delays in realization, or inability to collect dues, could adversely impact our results of operations, working capital cycle, and cash flows.

While we have not experienced material bad debts during the last three Fiscals, there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future. If defaults increase, we may be required to provide for doubtful debts, write off receivables, or allocate greater working capital to finance outstanding balances, which may increase financing costs and reduce profitability.

Enforcing contractual rights through legal action against customers can be time-consuming, costly, and uncertain. Even if judgments are obtained, recovery may be difficult in cases where customers face insolvency, liquidation, or bankruptcy. Any significant delays or defaults in receivable collections, or failure to recover outstanding dues, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

## 29. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us against all potential losses, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, and profitability.

Our insurance policies may not adequately cover all risks or potential losses. We may not have identified every risk, and we may be uninsured against certain risks either because such risks are uninsurable, not insurable on commercially acceptable terms, or because the cost of obtaining coverage is not commercially feasible. In addition, our insurance coverage is subject to specified limits and exclusions, and losses in excess of these limits, or losses arising from events not covered under our policies, would need to be borne by us. For instance, risks such as pandemics (including COVID-19), certain operational risks, natural calamities, business interruptions, regulatory actions, or other unforeseen events may not be covered by our policies or may only be partially covered.

We cannot assure you that our insurance policies will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards and liabilities to which we may be exposed. Further, our insurance coverage is subject to periodic renewal. While we apply for renewals in the ordinary course of business and have not
