Under this plan, every employee who has completed at least five years of continuous service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days of last drawn salary for each completed year of service. The plan is not funded by the Company. Gratuity is thus paid to the employees on separation in accordance with the provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
