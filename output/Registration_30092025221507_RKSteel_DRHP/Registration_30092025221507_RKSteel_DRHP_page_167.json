MS pipes are made from mild steel, which is a low carbon steel containing less than 0.25% carbon. This low carbon content makes the steel easier to weld and shape, allowing it to be manufactured into various forms suitable for piping and tubing purpose. Prominent properties of mild steel are its ductility – where mild steel can be bent without breaking, weldability – where it can be easily welded into different shapes and affordability – available at lesser pricing than other types of steel due to its lightweight and lower production costs. MS steel pipes are manufactured using two main processes: seamless and welded, with welded pipes further classified into ERW and SAW types. Both methods are widely used in industries such as oil & gas, water"}]
