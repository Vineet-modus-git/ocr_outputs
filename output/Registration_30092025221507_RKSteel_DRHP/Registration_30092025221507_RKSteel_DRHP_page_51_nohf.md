Furthermore, our Company despite commissioning a detailed online search at the ROC through independent Practicing Company Secretary, is not able to trace Form 23B for the fiscal 2007 and 2010, form 2 for fiscal 2009, Form 66 for fiscal 2010, Form DR-3 KYC of Abhsihek Bhalotia for Fiscal 2021 and Form 23C for fiscal 2014. Accordingly, an intimation to RoC was sent regarding the untraceable form.

**16. Our ability to access capital at attractive costs depends on our credit ratings. Non-availability of credit ratings or a poor rating may restrict our access to capital and thereby adversely affect our business, financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations.**

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have not engaged any credit rating agency for obtaining a credit rating in respect of our Company or any of our debt. In the past, we had engaged certain credit rating agencies that assigned us ratings. However, upon completion of their engagement or non-renewal, such agencies downgraded our rating and publish it with the note "*Issuer Not Cooperating*".

Any unfavourable credit rating assigned to us, or a downgrade of any rating in the future for any reason, may negatively impact our ability to access borrowings on competitive terms. This may result in higher interest costs, more stringent borrowing conditions, or even restricted access to credit, thereby increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our liquidity.

While we intend to maintain prudent financial discipline and operational performance to mitigate such risks, there can be no assurance that any future credit rating, if obtained, will be favourable or that it will not be subject to revision, suspension, or withdrawal.

**17. Our operations are working capital intensive, and our working capital cycle has lengthened in Fiscal 2025, indicating increased dependence on external financing, which may adversely affect our liquidity, business operations and results of operations.**

Our business is inherently working capital intensive, given the nature of our operations, which require maintaining substantial inventory of raw materials and finished goods, and offering credit to customers across both manufacturing and trading activities.

Our working capital days stood at 93.00 days in Fiscal 2023, 86.00 days in Fiscal 2024, and increased to 104.00 days in Fiscal 2025, indicating a lengthening of our working capital cycle in the most recent fiscal period. The increase in working capital requirements during Fiscal 2025 was primarily on account of:

* Higher inventory levels, reflecting stocking of raw materials and finished goods to support expanded production capacity and trading volumes;
* Increase in trade receivables, due to extended credit offered to customers to sustain competitive positioning; and
* Rise in purchase of stock-in-trade, consequent to the expansion of our HR coil trading business, which is inherently working capital intensive.

An elongated working capital cycle results in higher reliance on short-term borrowings and an increase in finance costs, adversely impacting profitability and operating cash flows. Any further increase in inventory holding period or delay in receivables collection may accentuate liquidity pressures.

We cannot assure you that our working capital cycle will not lengthen in future periods. Any inability to efficiently manage our working capital requirements or timely realize receivables could increase our dependence on external financing and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.

**18. We are subject to strict quality requirements, and any product defects or failure by us or our raw material suppliers to comply with prescribed quality standards may result in order cancellations, recalls, reputational harm, and potential product liability claims.**

Our business is subject to strict quality requirements imposed by regulators, customers, and industry practices. The products manufactured by us are required to comply with the standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards ("BIS") as well as the specifications mandated by our customers. While our
