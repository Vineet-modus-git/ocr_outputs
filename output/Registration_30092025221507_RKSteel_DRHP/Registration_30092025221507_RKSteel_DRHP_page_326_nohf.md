Foreign currency risk sensitivity

The sensitivity of pre-tax profit or loss to changes in exchange rates arises mainly from foreign currency denominated asset and the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD exchange rates, with all other variables held constant is as below:

A 1% depreciation of the INR against the USD would decrease the profit after tax and a 1% appreciation of the INR against the USD would increase the profit after tax by the same amounts. The effects of these sensitivities are summarized in the table below.

<table><thead><tr><th>Risk Type</th><th>Change Assumed</th><th>Impact on Profit After Tax/ Loss</th><th>2025</th><th>2024</th><th>2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Foreign Currency Risk (USD exposure)</td><td>INR depreciates 1%</td><td>Decrease</td><td>-</td><td>0.496</td><td>0.489</td></tr><tr><td>INR appreciates 1%</td><td>Increase</td><td>-</td><td>0.496</td><td>0.489</td></tr></tbody></table>

The company does not have any unhedged foreign currency exposure except for those disclosed above.
