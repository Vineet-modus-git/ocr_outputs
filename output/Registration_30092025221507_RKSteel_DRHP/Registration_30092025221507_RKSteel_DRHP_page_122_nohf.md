As on August 18, 2025 our Company had sanctioned facilities aggregating to ₹41993.66 lakhs and outstanding facilities as on August 18, 2025 aggregating to ₹ 29,151.41 lakhs. Our Company proposes to utilise an estimated amount of ₹ 4323.02 lakhs from the Net Proceeds towards full or partial repayment or pre-payment of certain borrowings availed by our Company. Given the nature of these borrowings and the terms of repayment or pre-payment, the aggregate outstanding amounts under these borrowings may vary from time to time and our Company may, in accordance with the relevant repayment schedule, repay or refinance some of their existing borrowings or avail of additional credit facilities. If at the time of the Red Herring Prospectus, any of the below-mentioned loans are repaid in part or full or refinanced or if any additional credit facilities are availed or drawn down or if the limits under the working capital borrowings are increased, then our Company may utilise the Net Proceeds for part or full pre-payment / repayment of any such refinanced facilities or repayment of any additional facilities obtained by our Company and details of such borrowings will be included in the Red Herring Prospectus. However, the aggregate amount to be utilised from the Net Proceeds towards repayment or pre-payment of certain of our borrowings (including refinanced or additional facilities availed, if any), in part or full, would not exceed ₹4323.02 lakhs. We believe that such repayment/ pre-payment will help reduce our Company's outstanding indebtedness and debt servicing costs and enable utilisation of our Company's internal accruals for further investment in our Company's business growth and expansion. Additionally, our Company believes that the leverage capacity of our Company will improve its ability to raise further resources in the future to fund potential business development opportunities and plans to grow and expand our business.

The selection of borrowings proposed to be repaid/ prepaid out of the borrowings provided below, shall be based on various factors including (i) cost of the borrowings to our Company, including applicable interest rates, (ii) any conditions attached to the borrowings restricting our Company's ability to prepay the borrowings and time taken to fulfil such requirements, (iii) receipt of consents for prepayment or waiver from any conditions attached to such prepayment from our respective lenders, prior to completion of the Issue; (iv) terms and conditions of such consents and waivers, (v) levy of any prepayment penalties and the quantum thereof, (vi) provisions of any law, rules, regulations governing such borrowings, and (vii) other commercial considerations including, among others, the amount of the loan outstanding and the remaining tenor of the loan.

The following table provides details of certain of the borrowings availed by our Company, which are currently proposed to be fully or partially repaid (earlier or scheduled) or pre-paid from the Net Proceeds*:
