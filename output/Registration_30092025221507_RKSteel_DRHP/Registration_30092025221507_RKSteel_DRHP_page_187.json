This decision follows an investigation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), which found that these products were being exported at prices below their production costs due to subsidies provided by their governments.\n* The anti-dumping investigations are initiated in response to complaints from domestic industry associations. In October 2021, a notification was passed by Ministry of Finance, Government of India based on the recommendation made by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) to extend the anti-dumping duty on Stainless Steel Seamless Tubes and Pipes from China for a period of 5 years.\n* In December 2022, the Indian Government has imposed an anti-dumping duty on Stainless Steel Seamless Tubes and Pipes from China which is the top exporting country for India with a share of 60% in total imports, to protect the domestic players.\n* The custom duty was placed on Stainless-Steel Seamless Tubes and Pipes with diameter up to and including 6 NPS, or comparable thereof in other unit of measurement, whether manufactured using hot extrusion process or hot piercing process and whether sold as hot finished or cold finished pipes and tubes, including subject goods imported in the form of defectives, non-prime or secondary grades originating in or exported from China.\n* The duties levied on the products are in range from USD 114 to USD 3,801 per tonne. This act came effective because of continuous and massive dumping of goods from the import country despite the duties that were in effect and affected the domestic market.\n* The imposition of anti-dumping duties aims to create a level playing field for Indian manufacturers, allowing them to compete more effectively against subsidized foreign products. While these duties may increase import costs, officials have assured that they will not significantly affect product availability in the Indian market.\n* The Indian government has also been considering increasing import duties on steel from the current 7.5% to between 10% and 12% as part of its strategy to combat dumping practices further."}, {"bbox": [236, 1895, 1498, 2058], "category": "Text", "text": "The anti-dumping duty framework in India plays a vital role in shielding domestic steel manufacturers from unfair trade practices associated with subsidized imports.
