This highlights significant gaps in industrial development and infrastructure usage across the continent. Oceania, while producing a marginal 5.3 million tonnes of crude steel, shows a relatively higher per capita consumption of 153.2 kg, suggesting efficient domestic usage or higher living standards and infrastructure demands relative to its population size.

Nearly 80% of these cases were directed at Asian suppliers, with China alone being the subject of over one-third. Alongside these product-specific actions, many countries have also implemented broader trade measures, such as blanket tariff hikes across the steel sector.

In CY 2020, exports stood at 378.8 million tonnes, a figure influenced by the pandemic-related disruptions. The sector rebounded strongly in CY 2021, reaching 436.3 million tonnes—the highest in the five-year period—driven by post-pandemic recovery and restocking demand. However, this momentum slowed in CY 2022, with exports falling back to 378.4 million tonnes, likely due to global inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties. The following years showed a gradual recovery, with exports rising to 402.9 million tonnes in CY 2023 and further to 422.7 million tonnes in CY 2024. This recovery trend suggests improved demand, particularly in infrastructure and construction sectors, along with aggressive export strategies by major producers like China. Overall, while the period was marked by fluctuations, the latter years point toward a stabilizing global trade environment for steel products."}]
