Despite its massive output, Asia's per capita consumption (283.2 kg) remains slightly lower than that of the European Union (290.7 kg) and Other Europe (285.5 kg). This suggests that a significant portion of Asia's production might be exported or used in industrial capacities rather than directly reflecting domestic per-person usage. In contrast, the European Union, while producing a comparatively modest 126.3 million tonnes of crude steel, exhibits the highest per capita consumption, indicating a more intensive domestic utilization of steel in infrastructure, automotive, and manufacturing sectors."}, {"bbox": [233, 1910, 1498, 2137], "category": "Text", "text": "**North America**, with 104.4 million tonnes of crude steel and 134.2 million tonnes of finished steel, showcases a notable divergence between crude and finished steel volumes.
