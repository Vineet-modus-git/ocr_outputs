As our operations expanded, we recognized the need to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to meet increasing demand, improve efficiency, and align with our long-term growth strategy. To facilitate this expansion, we strategically decided to establish a larger, more advanced manufacturing facility that would enable us to scale our operations and integrate modern production technologies under one roof. Accordingly, in the year 2016, we entered into a 99-year lease for a new manufacturing facility at Perundurai, Tamil Nadu, India and in 2018 commenced operation at the new manufacturing facility (\"Manufacturing Facility\"). With the successful establishment and operational stability of our Manufacturing Facility, we completely transitioned from our Erstwhile Chennai Facility to the new Manufacturing Facility.
