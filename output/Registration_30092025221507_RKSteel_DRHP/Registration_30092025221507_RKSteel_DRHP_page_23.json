We compute and disclose such Non-GAAP Measures and such other statistical information relating to our operations and financial performance as we consider such information to be useful measures of our business and financial performance. These Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, Ind AS, Indian GAAP, IFRS or US GAAP. Further, these Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to cash flows, profit/ (loss) for the years/ period or any other measure of financial performance or as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities derived in accordance with Ind AS, Indian GAAP, IFRS or US GAAP. In addition, these Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized terms, hence a direct comparison of these Non-GAAP financial measures between companies may not be possible. These Non-GAAP Measures and other statistical and other information relating to our operations and financial performance may not be computed on the basis of any standard methodology that is applicable across the industry and therefore may not be comparable to financial measures and statistical information of similar nomenclature that may be computed and presented by other companies and are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by Ind AS and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and hence have limited usefulness as a comparative measure. For details, refer \"Risk Factors – We have in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus included certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain other industry measures related to our operations and financial performance. These non-GAAP measures and industry measures may vary from any standard methodology that is applicable across the industry, and therefore may not be comparable with financial or industry related statistical information of similar nomenclature computed and presented by other companies\" on page 74."}]
