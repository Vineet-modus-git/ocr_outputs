Nagalapuram Venkatesulu vs The State of Andhra Pradesh, Pramod Kumar Bhalotia and ors –
W.P. No. 23680 of 2018

Nagalapuram Venkatesalu ("Petitioner") has filed a suspension petition bearing number 23608 of 2018, before the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad for the state of Telangana and for the state of Andhra Pradesh ("Hon'ble Court") against The State of Andhra Pradesh ("Respondent 1"), The Joint Collector ("Respondent 2"), The Sub-Collector ("Respondent 3"), The Tahsildar ("Respondent 4") and Pramod Kumar Bhalotia ("Respondent 5") (Collectively referred to as "Respondents"). The Petitioner contends that Respondent No. 5 was wrongly issued a pattadar passbook by Respondent 4 for land in Survey Nos. 92/25 (0.19 cents), 92/26 (0.21 cents), 92/57 (0.57 cents) and 93/15 (0.53 cents) ("disputed land/land") situated at Karani Village. As a result, the Petitioner filed an Appeal dated March 24, 2014, before Respondent 3, seeking cancellation on the ground that the Petitioner has been in possession and enjoyment of the said lands for several years and that the lands stood registered in his grandfather's name as per the fair Adangal records. The Petitioner further asserted that his forefathers had never alienated the property. However, Respondent No. 5, in collusion with one of the Petitioner's relatives, relied upon fabricated documents claiming a sale deed bearing no 569 of 1976, despite the fact that the Petitioner's grandfather had passed away in 1973. The Respondent 3, vide order bearing no. D.Dis H/1649/2014, dated June 27, 2017, ruled in favour of the Petitioner and set aside the pattadar passbook. Further, dissatisfied by this, Respondent No. 5 filed a Revision Petition before Respondent 2, who passed an order bearing no. D. Dis (D4) 5474/2016, dated October 2017 in favour of Respondent No. 5. Being aggrieved by the order passed by Respondent 2, the Petitioner has filed the present petition and prays before the Hon'ble Court to issue a writ, order or direction, more particularly one in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to suspend the proceedings bearing no. D. Dis (D4) 5474/2016, dated October 2017 of Respondent 2 and to pass any such order or direction as the Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the given circumstances of the case. The matter is currently pending, and the next date of hearing is not yet
