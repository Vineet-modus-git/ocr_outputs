Some of our marketing initiatives are set forth below:

* Personalized visits: Our Company organizes personalized visits to prominent traders. During such visits, we provide detailed information in relation to our key products and assist in addressing their queries.
* Retailers' meet: These formal meetings with the retailers involve a detailed presentation about our Company and its key products offerings. We conduct such sessions once a quarter.
* Events: In addition, our sales team under the guidance of our Promoters at times participates in industry events, trade fairs and exhibitions, which allows us to connect with potential customers and gather market intelligence.

Further, to strengthen relationships with traders and boost their confidence in our business, we offer targeted incentives that recognize and reward high performance. These incentives include foreign travel opportunities, special discounts, and exclusive benefits for top-performing traders. By implementing such appreciation programs, we aim to foster long-term partnerships, encourage higher engagement, and enhance trader loyalty. These initiatives not only motivate traders to achieve better results but also contribute to strengthening our distribution network and market reach. Moving forward, we will continue to explore and refine our trader appreciation strategies to drive sustained growth and collaboration.

## COMPETITION

We operate in a competitive business, both in India and overseas. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources, better distribution network, technical and marketing resources and generate greater revenues, and therefore may be able to respond better to market changes than we can. However, we continuously strive to remain competitive and identify emerging opportunities. We believe that our consistent tracking of markets, and our ability to deliver products with requisite specifications and our consistent interaction with our customers is a key to our competitiveness.

Competition from existing players and new entrants and consequent pricing pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business growth and prospects, financial condition and results of operations**” on page 144 and 55.
