contractual terms.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables and other financial assets, the company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

The Company considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 365 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

In general, the Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade receivables that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to past payment history, security by way of deposits, external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash flow projections and available press information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement

(f) Financial liabilities

*Initial recognition and measurement*

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.

*Subsequent measurement*

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified in two categories:

* Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

* Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and borrowings)

*Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss*

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
