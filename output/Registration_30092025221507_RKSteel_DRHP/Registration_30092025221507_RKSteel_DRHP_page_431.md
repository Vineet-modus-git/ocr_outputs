requirement for the Registrar to submit details of cancelled, withdrawn or deleted applications, and the
requirement for the bank accounts of unsuccessful Bidders to be unblocked no later than one Working Day from
the date on which the Basis of Allotment is finalised. Failure to unblock the accounts within the timeline would
result in the SCSBs being penalised under the relevant securities law.

Further, in terms of the UPI Circulars, the payment of processing fees to the SCSBs shall be undertaken pursuant
to an application made by the SCSBs to the BRLM, and such application shall be made only after (i) unblocking
of application amounts for such application received by the SCSB has been fully completed, and (ii) applicable
compensation relating to investor complaints has been paid by the SCSB.

All SCSBs offering facility of making application in public issues shall also provide facility to make application
using UPI. Our Company will be required to appoint one of the SCSBs as a sponsor bank to act as a conduit
between the Stock Exchanges and NPCI in order to facilitate collection of requests and/or payment instructions
of the UPI Bidders using the UPI. For further details, refer to the General Information Document available on the
websites of the Stock Exchanges and the BRLM.
