* political instability, terrorism, military conflict, epidemic or public health issues in India or in countries in the region or globally, including in India's various neighbouring countries;
* macroeconomic factors and central bank regulation, including in relation to interest rates movements which may in turn adversely impact our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs;
* Instability in financial markets and volatility in, and actual or perceived trends in trading activity on, India's principal stock exchanges;
* decline in India's foreign exchange reserves which may affect liquidity in the Indian economy;
* downgrading of India's sovereign debt rating by rating agencies;
* difficulty in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable terms and/or a timely basis.

Moreover, a fall in the purchasing power of our customers, for any reason whatsoever, including rising consumer inflation, availability of financing to our customers, changing governmental policies and a slowdown in economic growth may have an adverse effect on our customers' revenues, savings and could in turn negatively affect their demand for our products. In addition, any slowdown or perceived slowdown in the Indian economy, or in specific sectors of the Indian economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and the price of the Equity Shares.

**78. Inflation in India could have an adverse effect on our profitability and if significant, on our financial condition.**

Inflation rates in India have been volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue. India has experienced high inflation relative to developed countries in the recent past. Continued high rates of inflation may increase our expenses related to costs of raw material, rent, salaries or wages payable to our employees or any other expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on any additional expenses to our customers or that our revenue will increase proportionately corresponding to such inflation. Accordingly, high rates of inflation in India could have an adverse effect on our profitability and, if significant, on our financial condition.

**79. Foreign investors are subject to foreign investment restrictions under Indian law that limits our ability to attract foreign investors, which may adversely impact the market price of the Equity Shares.**

Under the foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfers of shares between non-residents and residents are freely permitted (subject to certain exceptions) if they comply with the pricing guidelines and reporting requirements specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which are sought to be transferred, is not in compliance with such pricing guidelines or reporting requirements or falls under any of the exceptions referred to above, then the prior approval of the RBI will be required. Additionally, shareholders who seek to convert the Rupee proceeds from a sale of shares in India into foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India will require a no objection/ tax clearance certificate from the income tax authority. There can be no assurance that any approval required from the RBI or any other government agency can be obtained on any particular terms or at all.

**80. Any downgrading of India's debt rating by an independent agency may harm our ability to raise financing.**

Any adverse revisions to India's credit ratings for international debt by international rating agencies may adversely affect our ability to raise additional overseas financing and the interest rates and other commercial terms at which such additional financing is available. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our growth on favourable terms or at all, and consequently adversely affect our business and financial performance and the price of our Equity Shares.

**81. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.**
