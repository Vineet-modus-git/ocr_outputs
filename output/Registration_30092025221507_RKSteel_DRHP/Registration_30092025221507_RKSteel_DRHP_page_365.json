The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred."}, {"bbox": [336, 792, 1496, 856], "category": "Text", "text": "Cost of intangible assets under development as at the reporting date are disclosed as intangible assets under development."}, {"bbox": [336, 888, 1363, 921], "category": "Text", "text": "A summary of amortization policies applied to the Company's intangible assets is as below:"}, {"bbox": [336, 952, 1000, 985], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### Category of assets Useful life estimated by management"}, {"bbox": [336, 1016, 641, 1049], "category": "Text", "text": "Computer software 3 years"}, {"bbox": [236, 1080, 754, 1113], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### (d) Impairment of non-financial assets"}, {"bbox": [336, 1144, 1496, 1367], "category": "Text", "text": "The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
