* countries like Japan and South Korea and reduce its foreign exchange outgo related to imports.
  The PLI scheme for specialty steel is a strategic initiative that aims to transform India's steel sector by enhancing domestic production capabilities, reducing import dependency, and creating a competitive manufacturing environment. By focusing on high-value-added products, this policy not only supports economic growth but also aligns with broader goals of self-reliance under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative.

## Budget Initiatives¹

The budget initiatives in steel pipes production in India reflect the government's commitment to enhancing domestic manufacturing capabilities, promoting infrastructure development, and ensuring the growth of the steel sector.

* In February 2024, the government has implemented various measures to promote self-reliance in the steel industry.
* Union the Union Budget 2023-24, the government allocated INR 701.5 Million (USD 8.6 million) to the Ministry of Steel. The government removed the 2.5% basic customs duty (BCD) on the import of ferronickel. Ferronickel is a key raw material for stainless steel and other specialty alloys. Ferrous scrap will continue to be exempt from BCD for another two years, until till 31 March 2026. Steelmakers use ferrous scrap as a minor input material.
* In addition, an investment of INR 75,000 crore (USD 9.15 billion) (including INR 15,000 crore (USD 1.83 billion) from private sources) has been allocated for 100 critical transport infrastructure projects for last and first mile connectivity for various sectors such as ports, coal, and steel.
* The Union Cabinet, Government of India approved the National Steel Policy (NSP) 2017, as it intends to create a globally competitive steel industry in India. NSP 2017 envisage 300 million tonnes (MT) steel-making capacity and 160 kgs per capita steel consumption by 2030-31.
* The Ministry of Steel is facilitating the setting up of an industry driven Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI) in association with the public and private sector steel companies to spearhead research and development activities in the iron and steel industry at an initial corpus of INR 200 crore (USD 30 million).
* The Government of India raised import duty on most steel items twice, each time by 2.5% and imposed measures including anti-dumping and safeguard duties on iron and steel items.

The budget initiatives related to steel pipes production in India highlight a comprehensive approach to fostering growth in the sector through incentives like the PLI scheme, significant investments in infrastructure, support for SMEs, and a focus on sustainability. These measures are expected to enhance domestic manufacturing capabilities, increase demand for steel products, and position India as a competitive player in the global steel market.

## Key Risks & Challenges

The steel pipes and tubes market in India faces several threats and challenges that can impact its growth and competitiveness. The key challenges of steel pipes and tube market include:

* The market is significantly affected by stiff competition from imported steel pipes, particularly from countries with established manufacturing capabilities and cost advantages. This influx of cheaper imports can pressure domestic prices, impacting the profitability of local manufacturers. The year FY2024 witnessed steel pipes and tubes imported from just three countries of China, Korea and Vietnam catering to nearly 70% of import volume. This high dependence and flooding of products from countries with cost advantages challenge growth opportunities of domestic participants and thus the revenue growth of Indian market.
* The growing availability of alternative materials, such as PVC and plastic pipes, especially for non-critical applications, poses a challenge to the demand for steel pipes. These alternatives are often perceived as more cost-effective and easier to install, which can limit market share for steel product. Increasing penetration of PVC and plastic pipes is a real threat to the market demand in a price sensitive country like India.
* **High Logistics Cost** – Logistics accounts to 14% of India's GDP and the costs are comparatively higher
