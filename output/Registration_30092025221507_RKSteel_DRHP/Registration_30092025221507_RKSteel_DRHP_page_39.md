We operate primarily in the southern region of India and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of Indian states. For Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, revenue from Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana which amounts to ₹ 1,13,484.64 lakhs, ₹98,737.63 lakhs and ₹84,074.28 lakhs constituting 98.86%, 96.59%, and 98.4% of total revenue from operations for Fiscal 2025., Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively.

*As certified by Statutory Auditors of the Company, through certificate dated September 19, 2025.

Our dependence on these concentrated geographies exposes us to region-specific risks, including adverse economic cycles, infrastructure bottlenecks, natural disasters, civil unrest, labour disruptions, or changes in local government policies and regulations. Any such development could disrupt our supply chain, impair distribution and logistics, or impact customer demand, thereby adversely affecting our business operations.

Although we have made limited exports to countries such as the United States of America, , and Peru, such exports accounted negligible to our total revenue in Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our business continues to be predominantly domestic in nature, with negligible international exposure. As such, we remain highly dependent on demand and economic stability in India, particularly in the southern states.
