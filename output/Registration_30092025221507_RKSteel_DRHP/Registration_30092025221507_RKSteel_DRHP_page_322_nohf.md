49 Fair values and hierarchy

Accounting classification and fair value of financial instruments is as follows. The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Similarly, unquoted equity instruments where the most recent information to measure

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The following methods were used for determining the classification of financial Asset and Financial Liabilities as Amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL :

- Financial Asset held within Business Model whose objective is to hold in order to collect contractual cash flows.

- Contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

- Liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading.

Since the company holds all financial assets with the business model to collect contractual cash flows and none of the financial liabilities are held for trading, all financial instruments are measured at amortized cost, unless otherwise mentioned.

The following table represents the carrying amounts of Company's financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025:
