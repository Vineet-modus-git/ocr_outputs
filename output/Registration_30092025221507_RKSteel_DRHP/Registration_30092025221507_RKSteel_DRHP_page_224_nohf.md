## ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES

We strive to operate our Manufacturing Facility in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and communities. The safety and security of our employees, customers, plants and equipment and assets is of utmost importance. We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the discharge, emission, storage, handling and disposal of a variety of substances that may be used in or result from our operations. For further details, see "Government and Other Approvals" on page 398.

In order to support sustainability, we have installed a captive solar photovoltaic plant with a capacity of 5.5 MW at Orikottai village, Thiruvadanai Taluka, Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu, India. Further, to align with environmental responsibilities and contribute to green energy solutions, we have adopted compressed biogas ("CBG") as a replacement for conventional furnace oil in our production process. This initiative reduces dependence on fossil fuels and supports cleaner energy usage. As a result, we have been acknowledged as one of the pioneers in sustainable industrial practices by Indian Oil Corporation Limited ("IOCL") (Source: D&B Report).

Our Manufacturing Facility has effluent treatment processes in compliance with applicable law. In the past, we have not been subject to any material fines or legal action involving non-compliance with any applicable environmental laws or regulations, nor are we aware of any threatened or pending action against us by any environmental regulatory authority.

We, from time to time, may adjust our internal policies to accommodate for material changes that have been implemented under the relevant labour and safety laws. In order to ensure the safety of our workforce, we internally implement operational procedures and safety standards for our manufacturing process including work-related injuries, electricity safety, and emergency and evacuation procedures.

We believe that accidents and occupational health hazards can be significantly reduced through a systematic analysis and control of risks and by providing appropriate training to our management and our employees and therefore we provide our workforce with occupational safety education and training to enhance their awareness of safety issues. Our workers are covered under the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 thereby entitling them to medical services for themselves and their immediate families.
