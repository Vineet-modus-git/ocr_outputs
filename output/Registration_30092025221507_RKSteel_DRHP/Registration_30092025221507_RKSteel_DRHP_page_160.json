Their demand is closely tied to global infrastructure investment, energy transitions, and industrial expansion. As economies recover and reorient post-pandemic, these products serve as essential enablers of large-scale pipeline networks, structural frameworks, and energy systems. The sector also reflects broader shifts in global trade patterns, with exports acting as a barometer of international project activity and geopolitical realignments."}, {"bbox": [261, 564, 1469, 1216], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [718, 1212, 1014, 1239], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: World Steel Association"}, {"bbox": [234, 1270, 1499, 1595], "category": "Text", "text": "Between CY2020 and CY2024, global exports of steel tubes and fittings rose from 32.3 million tonnes to 37.2 million tonnes, registering a growth of approximately 15%. This increase was driven by infrastructure stimulus measures in countries like the U.S., which allocated over $1 trillion under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and similar investments by the EU and China. The renewable energy sector also played a pivotal role—global solar and wind capacity additions exceeded 500 GW during this period, requiring significant volumes of steel components. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine conflict accelerated diversification of energy supply routes, prompting new pipeline projects and increasing steel tube demand. Exports from Asian countries, particularly China, surged to meet demand in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia under initiatives like the Belt and Road. These data points reflect a resilient and steadily expanding global trade environment for steel tubes and fittings, despite challenges such as rising input costs and trade restrictions."}, {"bbox": [234, 1621, 1060, 1658], "category": "Text", "text": "**The top 10 ranking for total exports and net exports are listed below:**"}, {"bbox": [234, 1685, 540, 1722], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**Major Global Exporters:**"}, {"bbox": [234, 1750, 1499, 2040], "category": "Text", "text": "The global steel export landscape in 2024 was dominated by China, which led both total and net exports by a significant margin. With total exports of 117.1 million tonnes and net exports of 108.4 million tonnes, China alone accounted for nearly a third of global steel trade. This surge is driven by the country's massive overcapacity and relatively lower domestic demand growth, prompting Chinese steelmakers to aggressively push volumes into global markets. Japan and South Korea followed, with 31.2 and 28.0 million tonnes of total exports respectively, although their net exports (25.0 and 13.8 million tonnes) were much lower due to high import volumes, particularly in South Korea. The European Union collectively exported 27.8 million tonnes, but when looking at net exports, the region falls behind countries like Russia, Iran, and Brazil, indicating a more balanced trade flow within EU borders and between trading partners."}, {"bbox": [236, 2066, 1495, 2141], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"3\">Total Exports CY 2024</th><th colspan=\"3\">Net Exports CY 2024</th></tr><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Country</th><th>Million Tonnes</th><th>Rank</th><th>Country</th><th>Million Tonnes</th></tr></thead></table>"}]
