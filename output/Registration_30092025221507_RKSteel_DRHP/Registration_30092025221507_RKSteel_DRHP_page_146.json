Policy shifts, particularly those reshaping trade, have alarmed financial markets and bruised business sentiment. The U.S.'s reciprocal tariffs, which represent additional costs for businesses from almost all countries with which the U.S. trades, charge trade partners an import duty at a discounted rate of approximately half the rate that the trade partner currently imposes on the U.S. According to U.S. President Donald Trump, reciprocal tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50%, are meant to address trade barriers limiting U.S. exports. The effective tariff rate includes other tariffs imposed at an earlier date and cumulatively may now be higher than duties charged on U.S. imports. It is unclear whether the reciprocal tariffs represent a negotiating tool, and may therefore be temporary, or form part of broader long-term protectionist measures and industrial strategy."}, {"bbox": [234, 1553, 1500, 1782], "category": "Text", "text": "Responses to reciprocal tariffs have been varied, with some economies promising swift countermeasures.

While Malaysia is seeking a united response across ASEAN, the Chinese Mainland has retaliated with duties on all imports from the U.S., declaring it will “fight to the end”. In early April 2025, the U.S. confirmed the most aggressive steps yet, with a cumulative 145% tariff on some products imported from the Chinese Mainland. Brazil has readied itself by passing a bill allowing for retaliation, Australia has ruled out retaliatory levies, and the EU remains open to negotiation while preparing a package of countermeasures."}, {"bbox": [234, 1809, 1500, 2036], "category": "Text", "text": "Tariffs and their unpredictable application have weighed on consumer and business sentiment, sunk global stock markets, raised recession risks, and made a global slowdown more likely.
