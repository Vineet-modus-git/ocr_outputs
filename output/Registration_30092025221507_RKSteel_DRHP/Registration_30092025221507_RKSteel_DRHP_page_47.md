*   **Demand-supply mismatch risk:** If actual market demand for our products does not grow in line with our expanded capacity, the mismatch could result in idle facilities and underperforming assets. Conversely, sudden surges in demand in specific product categories where utilization is already low may limit our ability to respond quickly.
*   **Operational inflexibility:** Persistently low utilization can result in idle machinery and lower workforce productivity, while also reducing our bargaining power with raw material suppliers and logistics providers who prioritize higher-volume buyers.

Our growth strategy is dependent on achieving higher utilization levels by (i) improving sales volumes in existing product categories, (ii) diversifying into geographies, and (iii) enhancing supply chain and order execution efficiency. However, factors beyond our control, such as macroeconomic downturns, shifts in industry demand, raw material price volatility, import/export policies, or logistical disruptions, could adversely affect our ability to utilize the expanded capacities optimally.

If we are unable to meaningfully increase the utilization of our enhanced capacities in a timely manner, we may not be able to derive expected operational efficiencies or generate adequate returns on our investments. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, and overall competitiveness.

9. **Our business is working capital intensive, and any inability to optimize our working capital cycle or rationalize our indebtedness may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, profitability, and growth prospects.**

Our operations are highly working capital intensive on account of extended inventory cycles and elongated credit periods granted to customers. As of Fiscal 2025, our working capital cycle stood at 104 days, and as of Fiscal 2024, it was 86 days and as of Fiscal 2023, it was 93 days. With the expansion of manufacturing capacity in Fiscal 2025, our working capital requirements are expected to rise further in the coming years. A prolonged working capital cycle results in higher reliance on external financing, increases our interest burden, and impacts overall liquidity.

In addition, our business is highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2025, our total outstanding borrowings stood at ₹ 35,109.22 lakhs, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.91. As of August 18, 2025, our total borrowings were ₹ 29,151.41 lakhs. High levels of debt increase our fixed obligations in the form of interest and principal repayments, reduce financial flexibility, and heighten our dependence on internal accruals. We propose to utilize a portion of the Net Proceeds from the Issue to repay or prepay certain of our existing borrowings to (i) reduce overall indebtedness, (ii) lower interest expenses, (iii) strengthen our balance sheet, and (iv) improve our debt-to-equity ratio.

However, our ability to deleverage remains subject to successful execution of these plans and to external factors such as interest rate movements and credit market conditions. An increase in interest rates or tightening of lending norms could materially increase borrowing costs. Our inability to refinance existing debt or raise additional funds on favourable terms could adversely impact our ongoing operations and future expansion plans.

High leverage also reduces our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures or adverse macroeconomic conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. For further details on the proposed utilization of Net Proceeds, see “Objects of the Issue” on page 119.

10. **Our EBITDA and PAT margins have remained persistently lower than those of our listed industry peers, indicating relatively lower operational profitability and efficiency, which may adversely affect our competitiveness, financial condition and results of operations.**

Our EBITDA margin and PAT margin have been lower compared to those of our listed industry peers as disclosed in the “Basis for Issue Price” chapter of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. Our EBITDA margin stood at 5.56%, 5.83%, and 4.21% in Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2025, respectively, and
