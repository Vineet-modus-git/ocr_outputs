Unlike crude steel, which primarily indicates upstream capacity, finished steel production captures actual demand and consumption readiness across value chains. Its trends are closely intertwined with global economic cycles, investment flows, and industrial output in both developed and emerging economies. Fluctuations in finished steel output can signal broader shifts in macroeconomic conditions, trade policies, raw material availability, and the intensity of infrastructure or housing development. Moreover, as countries pursue decarbonization, digitization, and re-shoring strategies, the structure of steel demand is evolving—often favoring higher-quality, customized, or lighter steel grades, further influencing production patterns. Thus, tracking finished steel production provides a more refined lens into global economic resilience, policy direction, and sector-specific transformations."}, {"bbox": [238, 694, 1492, 1211], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [718, 1213, 1013, 1239], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: World Steel Association"}, {"bbox": [236, 1269, 1499, 1498], "category": "Text", "text": "Global finished steel production has shown a fluctuating trend over the five-year period from CY 2020 to CY 2024. After recovering from the pandemic-induced slowdown in CY 2020 (1,790 MT) and peaking in CY 2021 at 1,843 MT, production has been on a consistent decline. The output dropped to 1,778.3 MT in CY 2022, further to 1,778.1 MT in CY 2023, and reached 1,742 MT in CY 2024. This downward trajectory post-2021 suggests a combination of factors such as reduced demand from key sectors like construction and automotive, economic slowdowns in major producing regions, supply chain disruptions, and a growing global focus on decarbonization and energy efficiency, which may have impacted capacity utilization and production planning."}, {"bbox": [236, 1524, 838, 1561], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**Global Per Capita Consumption of Finished Steel:**"}]
