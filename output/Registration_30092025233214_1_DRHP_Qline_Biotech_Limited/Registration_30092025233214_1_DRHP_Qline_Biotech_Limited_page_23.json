The market surged from 1,237 million USD in CY19 to 2,142 million USD in CY21 due to increased testing demand, followed by a sharp decline in CY22 and CY23 due to a high base from COVID-19 testing, which was not sustainable for continued growth, along with reduced pandemic-related testing. However, with growing healthcare awareness, and rising prevalence of chronic diseases, the market began recovering in CY24 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of up to 12.0%, reaching 2,978 million USD by CY30. This growth is likely to be driven by development of testing facilities and the rising burden of lifestyle diseases. With a steady demand for preventive healthcare, the market is expected to continue growth momentum, solidifying its critical role in India's healthcare sector."}, {"bbox": [91, 969, 1560, 1033], "category": "Text", "text": "*For further details, please refer to the chapter titled \"Industry Overview\" beginning on page 103 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.*"}, {"bbox": [91, 1065, 391, 1093], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## B.
