## OVERVIEW OF THE INDUSTRY

The India In-Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) market has experienced dynamic shifts, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The market surged from 1,237 million USD in CY19 to 2,142 million USD in CY21 due to increased testing demand, followed by a sharp decline in CY22 and CY23 due to a high base from COVID-19 testing, which was not sustainable for continued growth, along with reduced pandemic-related testing. However, with growing healthcare awareness, and rising prevalence of chronic diseases, the market began recovering in CY24 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of up to 12.0%, reaching 2,978 million USD by CY30. This growth is likely to be driven by development of testing facilities and the rising burden of lifestyle diseases. With a steady demand for preventive healthcare, the market is expected to continue growth momentum, solidifying its critical role in India's healthcare sector.
