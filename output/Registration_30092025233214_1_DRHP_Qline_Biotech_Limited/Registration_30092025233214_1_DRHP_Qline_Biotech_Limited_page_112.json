They are widely used for diagnosing infections, autoimmune diseases, and allergies. Examples include ELISA tests, rapid antigen tests, and immunoassays for hormone level measurement</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Clinical Chemistry</td><td>This category includes tests that analyse chemical substances in bodily fluids, such as blood and urine, to assess organ function, metabolic health, and disease markers. Common examples are blood glucose tests for diabetes, liver and kidney function tests, and cholesterol panels for cardiovascular risk assessment.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Haematology</td><td>These tests examine blood components, including red and white blood cells, platelets, and haemoglobin levels, to diagnose conditions like anaemia, infections, and blood clotting disorders. The Complete Blood Count (CBC) test is one of the most frequently conducted haematology tests.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Molecular Diagnostics</td><td>This field focuses on detecting genetic material (DNA or RNA) to diagnose infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and cancers. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests for viruses like COVID-19, HIV, and genetic mutation analysis for hereditary conditions fall under this category.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Others</td><td>This group consists of various diagnostic tests that do not fit into the above categories, such as microbiology tests, urinalysis, toxicology screenings, and point-of-care diagnostics. These tests help detect infections, metabolic disorders, and substance use.</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [99, 802, 962, 840], "category": "Caption", "text": "Chart 9: India In-Vitro Diagnostics Market Landscape – Breakup by Test Type"}, {"bbox": [101, 861, 1315, 1710], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [101, 1708, 603, 1770], "category": "Text", "text": "Source – Imarc Research, CareEdge Research\nOthers include"}, {"bbox": [89, 1787, 1563, 2016], "category": "Text", "text": "The diagnostic testing industry comprises of a wide range of test types, each serving a unique purpose in disease detection, monitoring, and treatment planning. Immunodiagnostics, clinical chemistry, haematology, molecular diagnostics, and other specialized tests collectively form an integrated ecosystem, where multiple tests are often required for a comprehensive evaluation of a single disease. This interdependence drives synchronized growth across all segments. In CY23, the market recorded a total value of 1,307 Million USD, with all test categories expanding at a similar pace. This momentum continued into CY24, reaching 1,511 Million USD, fuelled by technological advancements, increasing healthcare awareness, and the growing need for precise diagnostics. Way Forward, the market is projected to maintain its steady expansion, reaching 2,978 Million USD in CY30, with each test type"}]
