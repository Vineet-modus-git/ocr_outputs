Transfer of property is subject to stamping and registration under the specific statutes enacted for the purposes which have been dealt with hereinafter.

The T.P. Act recognizes, among others, the following forms in which an interest in an immovable property may be transferred:

* Sale: The transfer of ownership in property for a price, paid or promised to be paid.

* Mortgage: The transfer of an interest in property for the purpose of securing the payment of a loan, existing or future debt, or performance of an engagement which gives rise to a pecuniary liability. The T.P. Act recognises several forms of mortgages over a property.

* Charges: Transactions including the creation of security over property for payment of money to another which are not classifiable as a mortgage. Charges can be created either by operation of law, e.g. decree of the court attaching to specified immovable property, or by an act of the parties.

* Leases: The transfer of a right to enjoy property for consideration paid or rendered periodically or on specified occasions.

* Leave and License: The transfer of a right to do something upon immovable property without creating interest in the property.

Further, it may be noted that with regards to the transfer of any interest in a property, the transferor transfers such interest, including any incidents, in the property which he is capable of passing and under the law, he cannot transfer a better title than he himself possesses
