**45. Failure to comply with evolving data protection and privacy laws, or any cybersecurity breaches, could expose us to regulatory action, penalties, and reputational harm.**

Our business involves collection, storage, processing and transmission of significant amounts of personal, financial and transactional data of customers, employees, and business partners, which exposes us to risks relating to data protection, privacy compliance and cybersecurity. The recently enacted Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 ("DPDP Act") imposes strict obligations on entities handling personal data, including requirements relating to consent, purpose limitation, data processing, breach notification and grievance redressal. Non-compliance with the DPDP Act or similar regulations may attract substantial penalties, restrictions on data processing and reputational harm. We also face risks of cyberattacks, phishing, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks and other security breaches which may compromise sensitive data and disrupt operations. Any actual or perceived data breach could result in customer complaints, litigation, regulatory investigations and loss of trust. While we have implemented measures such as firewalls, encryption and security monitoring, such systems may not be sufficient to prevent sophisticated attacks or insider threats. In addition, the costs of maintaining and upgrading cybersecurity systems, training personnel and ensuring compliance with evolving data protection frameworks are significant and may increase over time. Insurance coverage may not adequately cover all losses arising from cyber incidents or regulatory penalties. As customer expectations and regulatory standards around data protection continue to rise, any failure to effectively safeguard data, ensure privacy compliance or respond to cybersecurity incidents could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operations and reputation.

**46. Our business may be adversely affected by international sanctions, changes in trade policy or the imposition of non-tariff barriers, which could impact our operations and exports.**

Our business is subject to risks arising from changes in trade policies, import/export regulations, sanctions and non-tariff barriers in India and internationally. Restrictions, licensing requirements, quotas, tariffs or sanctions imposed by domestic or foreign authorities may delay shipments, increase costs, or limit access to key markets. Non-tariff barriers such as customs procedures, quality standards, or local content requirements may affect supply chain efficiency and operational flexibility. Any sudden changes in trade policies or enforcement of sanctions could adversely impact our sourcing, distribution, and revenue. Our ability to anticipate and adapt to such regulatory changes is limited. Failure to comply with applicable trade regulations may also result in penalties or reputational harm. Such risks may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.

**47. Our company has encountered challenges in meeting the designated timelines for filing statutory returns, which may subject us to penalty under the relevant laws.**

There have been delays in filing GST, EPF and ESIC returns by our Company. After conducting an internal review, we have identified that the primary reasons for these delays are related to reconciliation and operational issues. To address this issue, we have implemented corrective measures to mitigate future delays. These measures include - Enhancing our reconciliation process to minimize discrepancies, implementing improved cash flow forecasting and management practices, strengthening communication and coordination within our team to expedite return filing. However, any future delays in the submission of these returns may result in financial penalties and potential legal consequences, which may affect our operations. Furthermore, delayed provident fund and ESIC returns can adversely affect our relationship with regulatory authorities, potentially leading to increased scrutiny and further financial repercussions.

**48. Our directors have no prior experience in managing a listed company, which may pose challenges in complying with regulatory requirements.**

Our directors do not have any prior experience in serving as directors of any listed entity. Consequently, they may face challenges in complying with regulatory requirements, corporate governance norms, and stakeholder expectations applicable to listed companies. However, our directors possess experience in the ceramic tableware manufacturing, regarding procurement of raw materials, production processes, quality control, and supply chain management. They have been instrumental in driving operational efficiency, expanding market reach, and ensuring product quality to meet industry standards. Their leadership, combined with the support of our employees have positioned the company to navigate the responsibilities of a listed entity while continuing to leverage their domain knowledge for business growth. However, there is still a possibility of delays or mistakes in compliance, which could impact our business, reputation, or share price.
