Any inaccuracy, contamination, or variability in test results could directly affect disease detection, staging, or monitoring, thereby impacting clinical decision-making and patient safety. False positives may lead to unnecessary treatments and costs, while false negatives may delay timely interventions and worsen outcomes. Emerging disease strains, genetic mutations, and complex patient profiles further increase the challenge of ensuring diagnostic reliability. Cross-reactivity of reagents, sample handling errors, and equipment malfunctions are additional sources of biomedical risk. Failure to maintain consistent test performance could result in withdrawal of products, regulatory sanctions, or large-scale recalls. Inaccurate diagnostics may also expose the company to medical liability claims and reputational harm.
