## Shortfall of Funds

Any shortfall in meeting the fund requirements will be met by way of internal accruals and or unsecured Loans.

## Bridge Financing Facilities

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have not entered into any bridge finance arrangements that will be repaid from the Net Proceeds. However, in case of delay in the IPO and consequent delay in accessing the net proceeds of the Issue, we may draw down such amounts, as may be required, from an overdraft arrangement/ cash credit/ term loan facility with our lenders or through unsecured loans to finance setting up of facilities as described in the section 'Objects of the Issue' until completion of the Issue. Any amount that is drawn down from such facility availed from any Bank/NBFC or Financial Institution or through unsecured loans during this period to finance 'Objects of the Issue' will be repaid from the Net Proceeds of the Issue.

## Monitoring Utilization of Funds

In accordance with Regulation 262 of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, our Company will appoint a monitoring agency ("Monitoring Agency") to monitor the utilisation of the Net Proceeds. Our Company undertakes to place the Net Proceeds in a separate bank account which shall be monitored by the Monitoring Agency for utilisation of the Net Proceeds. Our Company undertakes to place the report(s) of the Monitoring Agency on receipt before the Audit Committee without any delay and in accordance with the applicable laws. Our Company will disclose the utilisation of the Net Proceeds, including interim use under a separate head in its balance sheet for such financial year/periods as required under the SEBI ICDR Regulations, the SEBI Listing Regulations and any other applicable laws or regulations, specifying the purposes for which the Net Proceeds have been utilised. Our Company will also, in its balance sheet for the applicable financial year, provide details, if any, in relation to all such Net Proceeds that have not been utilised, if any, of such currently unutilized Net Proceeds.

The reports of the monitoring agency on the utilisation of the Net Proceeds shall indicate the deployment of the Net Proceeds under the following heads:

On an annual basis, our Company shall prepare a statement of funds utilised for purposes other than those stated in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus and place it before the Audit Committee and make other disclosures as may be required until such time as the Net Proceeds remain unutilized. Such disclosure shall be made only until such time that all the Net Proceeds have been utilized in full.
