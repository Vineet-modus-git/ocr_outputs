We leverage our R&D capabilities to develop and manufacture a portfolio of differentiated reagent formulations /products. Further, for our certain Class of Reagent & equipment's and devices manufacturing business, the company has entered into technical collaboration with certain international companies. Under the agreement terms, we undertake the manufacturing of these Reagent and equipment's and devices as per the technical collaboration and specifications provided by the partners or companies. With the help of these collaborations the equipment and devices adhere to strict quality control, international standards and certifications. As of March 31, 2025, we employed 23 personnel at our R&D laboratories, which constituted 7.35% of our total permanent employee strength.

Further, for the Make In India instruments, we are working on the following projects:

* **Selectra Pro M**: We are currently manufacturing the Selectra Pro M—a medium-throughput, fully automatic clinical chemistry analyser—in India under a technical collaboration with one of the European companies. This instrument has been successfully scaled up for commercial production and is already serving laboratories across multiple regions.

* **Selectra Pro XL & Mircolab 300** - Building on our partnership, we are developing "Make in India" prototypes of two additional analyzers:

1. **Selectra Pro XL** is a high-throughput, fully automatic clinical chemistry analyser designed for large laboratories and hospital networks.

2. **Mircolab 300**, a semi-automatic clinical chemistry analyser tailored for smaller facilities and point-of-care settings.

Both prototypes are in advanced stages of development and will undergo internal validation before moving to formal approval.
