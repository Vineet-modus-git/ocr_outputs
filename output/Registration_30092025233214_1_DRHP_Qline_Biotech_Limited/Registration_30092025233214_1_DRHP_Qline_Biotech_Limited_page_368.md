Bids received from Non-Institutional Bidders at or above the Issue Price shall be grouped together to determine the total demand under this category. The Allotment to all successful Non-Institutional Bidders will be made at the Issue Price. The allotment of specified securities to each non-institutional investor shall not be less than the minimum application size in the non-institutional investor category, and the remaining shares, if any, shall be allotted on proportionate basis.

The Issue size less Allotment to QIBs and Individual Investors shall be available for Allotment to Non-Institutional Bidders who have Bid in the Issue at a price that is equal to or greater than the Issue Price. If the aggregate demand in this category is less than or equal to [●] Equity Shares of face value of ₹10/- each at or above the Issue Price, full Allotment shall be made to Non-Institutional Bidders to the extent of their demand.

In case the aggregate demand in this category is greater than [●] Equity Shares of face value of ₹10/- each at or above the Issue Price, Allotment shall be made on a proportionate basis up to a minimum of [●] Equity Shares of face value of ₹10/- each and in multiples of [●] Equity Shares of face value of ₹10/- each thereafter. The allocation may be made in marketable lots on proportionate basis as set forth hereunder:

a. The number of Equity Shares to be allocated to the successful Bidders in a particular category shall be determined.

b. The successful Bidders, from amongst all valid Bidders in that category, shall be determined by a draw of lots, such that the total number of Equity Shares allotted in that category equals the number of Equity Shares allocated.

c. If the proportionate allotment to any Bidder results in a number that is not a multiple of [●] Equity Shares of face value ₹10/- each, the number of Equity Shares allotted shall be rounded off to the nearest multiple of [●] Equity Shares of face value ₹10/- each, subject to a minimum allotment of [●] Equity Shares of face value ₹10/- each.

If as a result of the process of rounding off to the nearest multiple of [●] Equity Shares of face value of ₹10/- each, results in the actual allotment being higher than the shares Issued, the final allotment may be higher at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, up to 110% of the size of the Issue specified under the Capital Structure mentioned in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
