Below are key growth demands in the IVD market based on the following points:"}, {"bbox": [89, 1456, 1564, 1718], "category": "List-item", "text": "1. **Growing Geriatric Population:** As the Indian geriatric population (typically aged 65 and above) continues to grow, there is an increased prevalence of age-related health issues such as diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders. This shift drives a higher demand for IVD tests, which play a crucial role in monitoring, diagnosing, and managing these conditions. Older adults are more susceptible to chronic diseases, necessitating regular diagnostic testing for conditions like blood glucose levels, kidney function, and cholesterol management. This growing need for ongoing monitoring ensures a steady demand for IVD solutions that aid disease management. Furthermore, as the elderly population increases, personalized healthcare becomes more important. IVD tests enable physicians to tailor treatment plans to individual patients based on specific diagnostic results, ensuring more effective and customized care for aging individuals."}, {"bbox": [89, 1745, 1564, 2102], "category": "List-item", "text": "2. **Technological Advancements:** Technological advancements in the IVD market have significantly transformed the landscape of medical testing. Innovations in automation, miniaturization (the process of significantly reducing the size of medical diagnostic devices used to analyse bodily samples (like blood or urine) outside the body), and artificial intelligence have improved the accuracy, speed, and accessibility of diagnostic tools, encouraging more healthcare facilities to adopt these advanced technologies. Additionally, breakthroughs in molecular diagnostics (a laboratory method that identifies diseases or disease risk by analysing molecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins present in a tissue or fluid sample), such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have allowed for more precise and efficient detection of infections, genetic disorders, and cancers, further driving market growth. Furthermore, advancements in point-of-care (POC) technologies enable testing outside traditional laboratories, providing faster results and improving disease management, especially in remote or underserved regions where access to central healthcare facilities may be limited. These technological innovations are reshaping the way diagnostic testing is performed, fuelling the expansion of the IVD market."}]
