Capitalized development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset under "Intangible Assets" in the Balance Sheet. The asset is amortized on a systematic basis over its estimated useful life, which is reviewed annually. The amortization period does not exceed ten years, unless a longer period can be justified.

(iv) **Review and Impairment:**

The carrying amount of capitalized development costs is reviewed at each reporting date for indicators of impairment in accordance with AS 28 – Impairment of Assets. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss
The estimated useful lives of intangibles are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td>Class of Asset</td><td>Useful life</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Computer software</td><td>5 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Servers</td><td>6 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Research & Development</td><td>10 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Customer cost of Acquisition</td><td>10 Years or the shorter period during the Revenue span of the project)</td></tr></tbody></table>

The residual values, useful lives and method of amortization of intangible assets are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate.

An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in statement of profit and loss.

**4. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION**

Depreciation is provided on a Written Down Value Method ('WDV') over the estimated useful lives of the property, plant and equipment as estimated by the Management and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Depreciation on additions (disposals) is provided on a pro-rata basis i.e. from (upto) the date on which asset is ready for use (disposed of).

The Management has estimated the useful lives for property, plant and equipment which is similar to the life specified in Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively if appropriate. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Amortization on Intangible assets is provided on a Straight Line Method (SLM) on the basis of the period over which the assets is expected to generate future economic benefits.

**5. BORROWING COSTS**

Borrowing cost includes interest and amortization of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.

**6. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS**

An asset is treated as impaired when the carrying cost of asset exceeds its recoverable value. An impairment loss is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which an asset is identified as impaired. The impairment loss recognized in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of amount.

**7. INVESTMENTS**

Investments, which are readily realizable and intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made, are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as long-term investments.

On initial recognition, all investments are measured at cost. The cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable acquisition charges such as brokerage, fees and duties.
