Consumers, especially in urban and semi-urban areas, are increasingly adopting over-the-counter rapid tests for early diagnosis and convenience, while digital health platforms are enhancing accessibility through app-based tracking and teleconsultations. Local manufacturing is gaining momentum, with a focus on affordability and disease-specific customization. Though rural adoption is still limited, government and NGO-led screening initiatives are expanding reach. With stricter regulatory oversight and growing emphasis on quality, rapid tests are evolving from emergency-use tools to essential components of routine healthcare."}, {"bbox": [101, 1348, 1332, 1888], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [90, 1963, 1562, 2158], "category": "Text", "text": "The Indian rapid test market has shown a dynamic trend between 2019 and 2024, starting at USD 47 million in 2019 and witnessing an unprecedented surge to USD 195 million in 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This spike reflects the urgent nationwide demand for rapid diagnostic solutions, especially for mass testing, screening, and containment efforts. However, following this peak, the market experienced a correction, with values moderating to USD 115 million in 2021 and gradually rising year-on-year to reach USD 143 million by 2024. This post-pandemic stabilization indicates that while the emergency-driven demand declined, the foundation for routine and preventive usage of rapid tests remained strong."}]
