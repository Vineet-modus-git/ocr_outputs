**Illustration of the Book Building and Price Discovery Process:** Bidders should note that this example is solely for illustrative purposes and is not specific to the Issue; it also excludes Bidding by Anchor Investors. Bidders can bid at any price within the Price Band. For instance, assume a Price Band of ₹20 to ₹24 per share, Issue size of 3,000 Equity Shares and receipt of five Bids from Bidders, details of which are shown in the table below. The illustrative book given below shows the demand for the Equity Shares of the Issuer at various prices and is collated from Bids received from various investors.

<table><thead><tr><td>Bid Quantity</td><td>Bid Amount (₹)</td><td>Cumulative Quantity</td><td>Subscription</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>500</td><td>24</td><td>500</td><td>16.67%</td></tr><tr><td>1,000</td><td>23</td><td>1,500</td><td>50.00%</td></tr><tr><td>1,500</td><td>22</td><td>3,000</td><td>100.00%</td></tr><tr><td>2,000</td><td>21</td><td>5,000</td><td>166.67%</td></tr><tr><td>2,500</td><td>20</td><td>7,500</td><td>250.00%</td></tr></tbody></table>

The price discovery is a function of demand at various prices. The highest price at which the Issuer is able to Issue the desired number of Equity Shares is the price at which the book cuts off, i.e., ₹22.00 in the above example. The Issuer, in consultation with the Book Running Lead Managers, may finalise the Issue Price at or below such Cut-Off Price, i.e., at or below ₹22.00. All Bids at or above this Issue Price are valid Bids and are considered for allocation in the respective categories.
