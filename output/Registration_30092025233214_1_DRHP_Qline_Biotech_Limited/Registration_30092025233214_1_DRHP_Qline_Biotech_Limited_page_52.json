Any financial turmoil, especially in the United States of America or Europe, may have a negative impact on the Indian economy. Although economic conditions differ in each country, investors' reactions to any significant developments in one country can have adverse effects on the financial and market conditions in other countries. A loss in investor confidence in the financial systems, particularly in other emerging markets, may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets. The global financial turmoil, an outcome of the sub-prime mortgage crisis which originated in the United States of America, led to a loss of investor confidence in worldwide financial markets. Indian financial markets have also experienced the contagion effect of the global financial turmoil, evident from the sharp decline in SENSEX, BSE's benchmark index and Nifty, NSE benchmark index. Any prolonged financial crisis may have an adverse impact on the Indian economy and us, thereby resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, profitability and price of our Equity Shares."}, {"bbox": [90, 616, 1464, 653], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**70.
