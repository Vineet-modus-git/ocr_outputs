Reusable IVD devices contribute 32% to the market, reflecting a significant but comparatively lower preference. The strong inclination toward disposable devices can be attributed to their advantages in reducing cross-contamination risks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and offering ease of use. As healthcare facilities increasingly prioritize infection control and diagnostic accuracy, the demand for disposable IVD devices is expected to sustain its dominance in the market."}, {"bbox": [92, 855, 650, 891], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Market Segmentation by Application Usability"}, {"bbox": [92, 919, 876, 954], "category": "Caption", "text": "Chart 4: India In-Vitro Diagnostics Landscape - Application Usability"}, {"bbox": [92, 1006, 1349, 1706], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [92, 1704, 609, 1738], "category": "Text", "text": "Source – Imarc Research, CareEdge Research"}, {"bbox": [89, 1779, 1563, 2037], "category": "Text", "text": "The In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) industry has experienced consistent growth from CY19 to CY24 across various applications, including infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiology, cancer/oncology, nephrology, autoimmune diseases, and others. Infectious diseases remain the dominant segment, showing consistent expansion, with the market size reaching 686 Million USD in CY24 and projected to grow to 1,293 Million USD by CY30. This growth highlights the essential role of diagnostics for infectious diseases in healthcare, fuelled by the rising demand for early detection and effective management. Other applications also demonstrate steady upward trends, despite some occasional fluctuations. The ongoing need for precise and efficient diagnostics, along with technological advancements, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and growing geriatric populations plays a significant role in this sustained growth."}]
