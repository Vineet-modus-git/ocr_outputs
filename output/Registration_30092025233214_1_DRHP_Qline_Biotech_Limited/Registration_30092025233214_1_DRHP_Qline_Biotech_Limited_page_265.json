Respondent No. 1 was an active member of All India Cabin Crew Association, a recognized union of employees. He had been raising concerns about flight safety and crew welfare since 2008. He alleged that senior officials at Petitioner held a grudge against him due to his advocacy. On 30 April 2015, he was assigned to operate Flight AI 966 (Jeddah-Hyderabad-Mumbai), but the flight commander denied him the mandatory 22 hours of uninterrupted rest required for safety. The flight was operated in violation of safety norms, with one door unmanned and Respondent No. 1 left behind in Jeddah. Despite his correspondence with authorities, no action was taken. Instead, Petitioner accused him of deliberately refusing to operate flights and terminated his services under Standing Order 17 of Air India Limited (AIL) certified under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. Consequently, a writ petition no. 1427 of 2015 (\"Writ Petition\") was filed by Respondent 1 against Petitioner and other Respondents at the High Court of at Bombay (\"Hon'ble High Court\"). It maybe noted that along with the Writ Petition and another writ petition bearing no. 875 of 2011 was filed against Petitioner and another (where Respondent No. 3 was not a party) before the Hon'ble High Court which also dealt with the same issue of Standing Order 17 and therefore, both the writ petitions were heard together."}, {"bbox": [152, 1896, 1559, 2087], "category": "Text", "text": "Both the writ petitions were disposed of by an order dated February 25, 2019 passed by Hon'ble High Court.

Further, from search conducted in the public domain, it is found that this special leave petition bearing no. 009783 of 2019 (\"SLP\") was filed by the Petitioner challenging the aforesaid Writ Petition and the same is pending. Since Respondent No. 3 has ceased to be a director of the Petitioner prior to the filing of the SLP, he does not have any access to the papers in respect of this SLP."}, {"bbox": [803, 2173, 848, 2200], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "262"}]
