DIVIDENDS AND RESERVE

76. The company in general meeting may declare dividends, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the Board.

77. Subject to the provisions of section 123, the Board may from time to time pay to the members such interim dividends as appear to it to be justified by the profits of the company.

78. i. The Board may, before recommending any dividend, set aside out of the profits of the company such sums as it thinks fit as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Board, be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the company may be properly applied, including provision for meeting contingencies or for equalizing dividends; and pending such application, may, at the like discretion, either be employed in the business of the company or be invested in such investments (other than shares of the company) as the Board may, from time to time, thinks fit.

ii. The Board may also carry forward any profits which it may consider necessary not to divide, without setting them aside as a reserve.

79. i. Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to shares with special rights as to dividends, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares in respect whereof the dividend is paid, but if and so long as nothing is paid upon any of the shares in the company, dividends may be declared and paid according to the amounts of the shares.

ii. No amount paid or credited as paid on a share in advance of calls shall be treated for the purposes of this regulation as paid on the share.

iii. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid; but if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date such share shall rank for dividend accordingly. That there shall be no forfeiture of unclaimed dividends before the claim becomes barred by law.
