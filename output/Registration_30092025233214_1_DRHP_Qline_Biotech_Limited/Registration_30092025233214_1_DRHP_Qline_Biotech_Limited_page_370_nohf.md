## Process for generating list of allotees: -

* Instruction is given by RTA in their Software System to reverse category wise all the application numbers in the ascending order and generate the bucket /batch as per the allotment ratio. For example, if the application number is 78654321 then system reverses it to 12345687 and if the ratio of allottees to applicants in a category is 2:7 then the system will create lots of 7. If the draw of lots provided by DSE is 3 and 5 then the system will pick every 3rd and 5th application in each of the lot of the category and these applications will be allotted the shares in that category.

* In categories where there is proportionate allotment, the Registrar will prepare the proportionate working based on the oversubscription times.

* In categories where there is undersubscription, the Registrar will do full allotment for all valid applications.

* On the basis of the above, the RTA will work out the allotees, partial allotees and non-allottees, prepare the fund transfer letters and advice the SCSBs to debit or unblock the respective accounts.
