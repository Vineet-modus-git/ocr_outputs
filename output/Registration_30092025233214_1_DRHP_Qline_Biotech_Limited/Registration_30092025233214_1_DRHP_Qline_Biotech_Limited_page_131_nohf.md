## Our Business Strategies

### Expanding presence in existing markets and entering new ones

According to the Care report, "As India's healthcare sector, the IVD industry is poised for steady growth, fuelled by technological innovations, growing geriatric populations, cost-efficient solutions, and increased adoption. The industry is moving towards automation enhancing accuracy and efficiency in disease detection. The India In-Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) market has experienced dynamic shifts, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The market surged from 1,237 million USD in CY19 to 2,142 million USD in CY21 due to increased testing demand, followed by a sharp decline in CY22 and CY23 due to a high base from COVID-19 testing, which was not sustainable for continued growth, along with reduced pandemic-related testing. However, with growing healthcare awareness, and rising prevalence of chronic diseases, the market began recovering in CY24 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of up to 12.0%, reaching 2,978 million USD by CY30. This growth is likely to be driven by development of testing facilities and the rising burden of lifestyle diseases. With a steady demand for preventive healthcare, the market is expected to continue growth momentum, solidifying its critical role in India's healthcare sector". We remain focused on strengthening our position within the IVD market and consolidating our market share. To achieve this, we aim to drive growth by improving our productivity, expanding our customer base and increasing the number of products manufactured. Currently our major sales is coming from the domestic Northen region. Region wise sales are presented in the table below:-
