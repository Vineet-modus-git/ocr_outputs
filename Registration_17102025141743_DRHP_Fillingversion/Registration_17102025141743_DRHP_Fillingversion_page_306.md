## Our Solutions

We offer a converged ecosystem of data center services, including colocation, build-to-suit, interconnection, and value-added services that enable clients to securely house their IT infrastructure in scalable and energy-efficient facilities, seamlessly connect with partners and cloud providers for data exchange, and optimize operations with tailored digital solutions that meet evolving demands. We also offer a range of incidental data center services, including “meet-me rooms” in many of our data centers, and a suite of asset set-up and regular maintenance services to our Hyperscaler and Enterprise clients.

The following is an overview of our principal solutions offerings.

### Colocation

We are one of the leading providers of data center colocation solutions in India, in terms of built IT capacity, as of March 31, 2025, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. Colocation data centers refer to facilities where clients can rent space to house their servers and IT equipment. The facilities provide power, cooling, bandwidth, and physical security, while clients generally maintain control over their hardware.

We offer a wide range of colocation solutions at all of our data centers. This includes leasing space according to clients' specifications from single-cabinet leasing to multi-megawatt capacity deployment and build-to-suit data centers.

To safeguard critical data and infrastructure of our clients, we have implemented 10 levels of security within our data centers, starting with perimeter security, physical frisking of entrants, closed-circuit television cameras and biometric access technology, providing comprehensive protection from gate to server.

### Build-to-suit

We offer build-to-suit services to meet the needs of our clients. Build-to-suit refers to custom-built data center solutions designed specifically to meet the unique requirements of a client, including specifications for space, technology, and operational needs, ensuring optimal functionality and efficiency. As part of our built-to-suit services, we collaborate with our client to define requirements, design the facility, oversee construction, manage operations and ensure that the finished product aligns with the client's operational needs and technological standards.

We leverage Sify Group's over 25 years of experience in the data center industry in India to provide cost-effective and credible build-to-suit solutions to our clients, including by adhering to the applicable enterprise compliance standards, codes and safety standards, offering professional services to our clients.

Our build-to-suit offering extends to large Enterprise clients and clients in the public sector.

### Interconnection

We offer interconnection services to our clients. Interconnection refers to the technologies and services that connect multiple data centers, enabling them to communicate and share data efficiently. This interconnection allows for enhanced scalability, redundancy, and improved disaster recovery capabilities. Interconnection provides several benefits, including increased bandwidth, improved data transfer speed, enhanced reliability and redundancy, simplified management of multi-cloud environments, and better disaster recovery options by allowing seamless data replication between data centers.

Our colocation offering facilitates interconnection by creating an environment in which Hyperscaler and Enterprise clients mutually benefit from colocating in our data centers. Enterprise clients have the opportunity to interconnect with our Hyperscaler clients, ensuring ultra-low latency for mission-critical applications; and equivalently, Hyperscaler clients can augment their offerings to their Enterprise clients through low-latency colocation.

In addition, all of our data centers are carrier-neutral, which ensures that our clients have the flexibility to connect to the network providers and cloud interconnects of their choice.

Moreover, our data centers are linked within an extensive hyperconnected ecosystem and provide connectivity with cloud service providers. We offer our clients the ability to connect from our data centers to more than 1 interconnection point that links to every availability zone of cloud service providers. Through this hyperconnected ecosystem our Enterprise clients can interconnect with our Hyperscaler clients, which ensures ultra-low latency for mission-critical applications.

### Value-Added Services

Our value-added services include the deployment of inter-rack cabling, rack and stack of servers, customized, compliant security deployment and procurement of equipment for our client.

In addition, together with STL and SDSL, we offer a unified GTM strategy, through which we augment our colocation, build-to-suit, interconnection, and value-added services with complementary offerings from STL and SDSL, and advance a converged portfolio of services to our clients, in particular to our Enterprise clients, who benefit from the availability of
