1. Department of Telecommunications ("DoT") had issued Internet Service ("ISP"), National Long Distance ("NLD") and International Long Distance ("ILD") licenses ("License Agreement") to Sify Technologies Limited ("STL"). The DoT issued demand letters dated September 11, 2013 ("Demand Notice 1"), August 22, 2023 ("Demand Notice 2"), January 11, 2024 ("Demand Notice 3"), January 16, 2024 ("Demand Notice 4") and April 1, 2024 ("Demand Notice 5") against STL seeking to levy license fee in respect of non-telecom/non-licensed activities carried ("Subject Matter") on by STL (collectively, "Demand Notices"). STL has filed writ petitions before the High Court of Madras ("High Court") challenging the Demand Notices seeking order or direction, declaring the provisions of the License Agreement in so far as it empowers the DoT to levy license fee in respect of non-telecom/non-licensed activities carried on by STL as ultra vires the Constitution of India and Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. Subsequently, STL has received a stay order from High Court dated June 6, 2014 ("Interim Stay") in relation to Demand Notice 1. Further, High Court vide its order dated April 30, 2024 quashed the demands made by way of Demand Notice 2 ("Order 1"). Thereafter, DoT invoked the bank guarantees furnished by STL in lieu of Demand Notice 3, 4 and 5, subsequent to which STL has obtained an interim direction from High Court restraining DoT from taking any further coercive steps against STL vide order dated July 19, 2025 ("Interim Stay 2"). The DoT has filed a writ appeal dated January 7, 2025 before the High Court of Madras challenging the decision made vide the Order 1 ("Writ Appeal"). The High Court granted an interim order dated May 22, 2025 restraining DoT from taking any further steps till the existing petitions are adjudicated. The matter is currently pending.

2. Sify Technologies Limited ("STL") made an application to the Southern Power Distribution Company Limited ("SPDCL") dated February 6, 2023 seeking permission to install availability based tariff ("ABT") meters and permit open access for enabling procurement of power from Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX) in order to achieve its sustainability and Net Zero goals. Due to inaction by SPDCL, STL filed a writ of mandamus vide writ petition number 30530 of 2023 before the High Court of Telangana and the same was allowed in favour of STL vide order dated June 18, 2024. Subsequently, SPDCL has preferred the writ appeal vide writ No. 1205/2024 which was posted for admission before the principal bench of High Court at Hyderabad on October 24, 2024 and notice was order to STL. The matter is currently pending.

3. Based on directives from the Department of Telecommunication ("DoT"), Sify Technologies Limited ("STL") migrated its license terms from old regime to the unified license Regime ("UL") in 2014. Pursuant to the migration, DoT directed STL to furnish fresh bank guarantee(s) under the terms of the new UL license. Further, STL's request to return the bank guarantees furnished under old regime was denied by DoT. STL filed a petition before the Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal ("TDSAT") vide petition number 25 of 2017, directing DoT to return the old bank guarantee and accordingly TDSAT directed DoT to return the old bank guarantee upon furnishing of fresh Bank Guarantee(s). DoT has retuned the old bank guarantee to STL and accordingly the matter is now infructuous. STL is in process to withdraw the present petition pending before TDSAT.
