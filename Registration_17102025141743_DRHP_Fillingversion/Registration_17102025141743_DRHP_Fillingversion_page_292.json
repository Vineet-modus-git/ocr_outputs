We expect AI-related capacity to be a key component of our offering in the future. AI workloads, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, especially those involving deep learning, demand significantly higher power densities. In addition, to manage the substantial heat generated, data centers are adopting advanced cooling solutions; liquid cooling systems, such as direct-to-chip and immersion cooling, are becoming essential to maintain optimal operating temperatures, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. AI-ready servers also require greater cable density, with additional fiber infrastructure compared to traditional systems. In addition, zonal architecture and modular design principles are important features of AI-ready data centers, as they allow effective segregation of workloads based on performance needs, thereby helping optimize cost and energy efficiency. The share of AI-related workloads is expected to rise from less than 1% in Fiscal 2025 to between 15% and 20% by Fiscal 2030, amounting to a data center demand of between 0.7 GW to 1.1 GW by Fiscal 2030, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. Our current AI-optimized data centers at the Rabale Data Center campus (Tower 5), the Noida 02 Data Center (Tower B) data center and the Chennai 02 Data Center (Tower B), are designed to attract high-value clients, boosting revenue and solidifying our market leadership in AI infrastructure. We are deploying AI-ready infrastructure to be well prepared to capitalize on this anticipated demand for AI infrastructure by Fiscal 2030, allowing us to remain competitive in the future, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report."}, {"bbox": [190, 940, 786, 977], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Focus on renewable investments and sustainability"}, {"bbox": [190, 1000, 1604, 1292], "category": "Text", "text": "We are committed to sustainability and making a lasting, positive impact on the environment and the global community.
