In particular, we distinguish ourselves as a trusted digital infrastructure provider for the banking, financial services and insurance (\"BFSI\") sector in India, by emphasizing stringent compliance and robust security measures, validated through globally-recognized standards such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, SSAE18 SOC 1 & 2, ISO 27017/27018 and TIA-942 Rated 4 certification, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. We have consistently secured regulatory certifications and approvals ensuring adherence to data sovereignty laws and BFSI-specific industry standards. For example, pursuant to SEBI Circular \"Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for SEBI Regulated Entities (Res)\" dated August 20, 2024, SEBI registrants, including banking institutions are required to store data with data centers that meet the standards of TIA-942 Rated 4 certification level. We have obtained TIA-942 Rated 4 certification for the Tower 5 facility at the Rabale Data Center campus, Tower B facility at the Chennai 02 Data Center and the Tower B facility at the Noida 02 Data Center. TIA-942 Rated 4 certification is the highest level of certification that represents fully fault-tolerant infrastructure, with redundant systems for all critical components, offering proof of a progressive hierarchy of availability and system design sophistication of a data center, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. This expertise enables our BFSI Enterprise clients to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes while maintaining operational resilience. As of June 30, 2025, we served 7 of the top 10 Indian banks (based on Fiscal 2024 revenues), according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. We have established ourselves as a trusted partner, providing secure, scalable, and compliant data center solutions tailored to the specific needs of the BFSI sector in India."}]
