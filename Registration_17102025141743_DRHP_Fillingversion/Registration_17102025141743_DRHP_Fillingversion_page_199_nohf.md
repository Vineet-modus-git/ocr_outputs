widely deployed. Lifts are provided by OEMs such as Kone, Thyssenkrupp, and Mitsubishi, while fire safety is covered by Kirloskar, Grundfos, and WILO. This diverse OEM landscape enables Indian data center developers to source reliable, scalable, and globally compliant solutions across all construction aspects.

### 2.1.5.8 CapEx and OpEx considerations for data centers

#### 1. Capital expenditure (CapEx)

To establish a new data center, there is a significant upfront capital expenditure (CapEx), which includes investments in land, civil infrastructure, power and cooling systems, electrical and mechanical fit-outs, IT hardware, networking equipment, and physical security systems. High CapEx becomes the most crucial entry barrier for most new players. The table below captures the key constituents of CapEx.

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Land and building infrastructure</td><td>Costs associated with acquiring or leasing land, construction of the facility, and structural design for high resilience, scalability, and compliance with Rated 3 or Rated 4 standards.</td></tr><tr><td>Power infrastructure</td><td>Includes high-capacity transformers, diesel generator sets (DGs), Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems, HT/LT panels, and redundant power supply architecture to ensure uninterrupted operations.</td></tr><tr><td>Cooling systems</td><td>Precision cooling solutions include chillers, CRAC/CRAH units, and HVAC systems tailored to support high-density computing environments.</td></tr><tr><td>IT and network infrastructure</td><td>Initial provisioning of server racks, storage systems, switches, routers, and cabling infrastructure.</td></tr><tr><td>Building Management Systems (BMS)</td><td>BMS installation to monitor and control critical infrastructure such as power, cooling, and security to ensure optimal performance and uptime.</td></tr><tr><td>Security systems</td><td>Physical and digital security systems including biometric access controls, surveillance systems (CCTV), fire detection and suppression systems</td></tr><tr><td>Compliance and certification</td><td>Expenditure on obtaining industry certifications such as ISO 27001, Uptime Institute Rating Certifications, and compliance with regulatory and safety norms.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### 2. Operating expenses (OpEx)

Operating expenses (OpEx) comprises the costs incurred to operate and maintain the data center facility post-commissioning. These typically include:

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Equipment and material cost (admin and soft service material)</td><td>Refers to consumables and non-IT materials required for day-to-day administration and upkeep, including cleaning supplies, stationery, and soft service tools. Assumed Equipment: Transformers, generators, Static UPS, CRAC, FWU, Chiller, Cooling tower, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Power consumption and electricity</td><td>Largest operational expense for data centers due to the continuous power required for servers, cooling systems, and infrastructure uptime</td></tr><tr><td>Preventive maintenance</td><td>Periodic servicing of the core and shell and machines (electrical, mechanical, HVAC, fire protection, and security systems) to ensure uninterrupted performance and reduce risk of failure.</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>Premiums for insuring physical assets, infrastructure, cyber liability, business continuity risks, and natural disaster coverage.</td></tr><tr><td>Other utilities</td><td>Includes water, gas (if applicable), sewage treatment, and other minor utilities that support facility operations beyond electricity.</td></tr><tr><td>Health, safety and environment (HSE)</td><td>Expenditure on maintaining workplace safety standards, compliance with environmental norms, and regular training or audits under ESG goals.</td></tr><tr><td>Finance</td><td>Comprises bank charges, transaction processing fees, interest on operational borrowings (if any), and related financial services.</td></tr></tbody></table>
