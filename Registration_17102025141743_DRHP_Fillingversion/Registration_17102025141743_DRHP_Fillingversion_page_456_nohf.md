## Significant Developments after June 30, 2025

Our Company, pursuant to the resolution passed by our Board on September 25, 2025, and the special resolution passed by our Shareholders on September 26, 2025, has approved and adopted the Sify Infinit Employee Stock Option Plan 2025 (the “ESOP 2025”) to create, issue, offer and allot, in one or more tranches, not more than 30,000,000 Equity Shares pursuant to ESOP 2025. The objective of ESOP 2025 is to (i) incentivize and reward employees for their continuous performance and association with our Company; (ii) attract and retain the key talents by way of rewarding their high performance and motivating them to contribute to the overall corporate growth and profitability of our Company; and (iii) enable employees to create wealth in future. The ESOP 2025 is in compliance with the SEBI SBEB & SE Regulations and other Applicable Laws.

As on date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, no employee stock options have been granted, vested, exercised, forfeited, lapsed or cancelled under the ESOP 2025.

To our knowledge there has been no additional subsequent development after the date of the Restated Consolidated Financial Information, which materially and adversely affects, or is likely to affect, our operations or profitability, or the value of our assets, or our ability to pay our material liabilities within the next 12 months.

## Critical Accounting Policies

The notes to our Restated Consolidated Financial Information included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus contain a summary of our material accounting policies and critical accounting judgements. Set forth below is a summary of our most significant accounting policies under Ind AS. The preparation of our restated consolidated financial information requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expense, assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to contingent liabilities on the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

### Use of Estimates and Judgements

The preparation of our Restated Consolidated Financial Information in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of financial information, income and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in future periods which are affected. For further information on the application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions, see “Restated Consolidated Financial Information—B.5 Use of estimates and judgements” on page 361.

### Foreign Currency

#### Foreign Currency Transactions and Balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognized in the financial information using exchange rates prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss for determination of net profit or loss during the period.

#### Foreign Operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to the functional currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations and cash flows are translated to the functional currency using average exchange rates during the period. Any differences
