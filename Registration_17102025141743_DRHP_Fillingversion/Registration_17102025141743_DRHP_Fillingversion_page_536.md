## SHARES AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE DIRECTORS

16. Subject to the provisions of the Act and these Articles, the shares in the capital of the Company shall, for the time being, be under the control of the Board of Directors who may issue, allot or otherwise dispose of any or all of such shares to such persons, in such proportion and on such terms and conditions, and either at a premium or at par or at a discount (subject to compliance with applicable laws) and at such time as they may from time to time think fit and with the sanction of the Company in the general meeting give to any person or persons the option or right to call for any shares either at par or premium during such time and for such consideration as the Board of Directors think fit.

Provided that option or right to call of shares shall not be given to any person or persons without the sanction of the company In the General Meeting.

## ISSUE OF SECURITIES AT A PREMIUM

17. The Company shall have power to issue Securities at a premium and shall duly comply with the provisions of the Act.

18. (a) The Company shall have a first and paramount lien upon all the shares/debentures (other than fully paid-up shares/debentures) registered in the name of each member (whether solely or jointly with others) and upon the proceeds of sale thereof for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of such shares/debentures and no equitable interest in any share shall be created except upon the footing and condition that this Article will have full effect and such lien shall extend to all dividends and bonuses from time to time declared in respect of such shares/debentures. Unless otherwise agreed the registration of a transfer of shares/debentures shall operate as a waiver of the company's lien If any, on such shares/debentures.

(b) The Company's lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable and bonuses declared from time to time in respect of such shares.

19. The fully paid shares shall be free from all lien and that in the case of partly paid shares the Company's lien shall be restricted to moneys called or payable at a fixed time in respect of such shares.

20. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Board thinks fit, any shares on which the Company has a lien:

Provided that no sale shall be made:

(a) Unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable; or

(b) Until the expiration of fourteen days after a notice in writing stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the share or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or insolvency.

21. To give effect to any such sale, the Board may authorize some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof and the purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer. The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale.

22. The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the Company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable and the residue, if any, shall, subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale, be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.

23. In exercising its lien, the Company shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any share as the absolute owner thereof and accordingly shall not (except as ordered by a Court of competent jurisdiction or unless required by any statute) be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether a creditor of the registered holder or otherwise. The Company's lien shall prevail notwithstanding that it has received notice of any such claim.

24. The provisions of these Articles relating to lien shall mutatis mutandis apply to any other securities including Debentures of the Company.

## CALLS ON SHARES

25. (a) The Board may, from time to time, make calls upon the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times.
