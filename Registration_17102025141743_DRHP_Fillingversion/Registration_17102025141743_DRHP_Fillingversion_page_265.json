Elevated depreciation in the initial years of capacity expansion typically suppresses EBIT and, consequently, ROCE. However, as these assets mature and contribute more meaningfully to revenues, the relative impact of depreciation declines, often resulting in a notable improvement in capital efficiency."}, {"bbox": [293, 652, 1602, 881], "category": "Text", "text": "Sify's depreciation rose from INR 2,083.00 million in Fiscal 2023 to INR 3,268.16 million in Fiscal 2025, resulting in a depreciation rate of 10.33% in Fiscal 2025 the highest among its peers. This partly weighed on its ROCE, which stood at 7.92% in Fiscal 2025. This elevated depreciation rate reflects SISL's aggressive investment in expanding its data center footprint. From an accounting standpoint, a higher depreciation rate accelerates the expensing of capitalized assets, reducing the book value of fixed assets more quickly. While this temporarily suppresses reported EBIT and return ratios such as ROCE, it also results in a leaner balance sheet over time, improving capital productivity as new assets begin generating stable revenues."}, {"bbox": [293, 905, 1602, 1133], "category": "Text", "text": "A few Indian players recorded a decline in ROCE during Fiscal 2025, coinciding with higher depreciation levels, suggesting that recent capital investments are yet to translate into proportional earnings. Global peers like Equinix and Digital Realty, with relatively stable depreciation trends, maintained low but consistent ROCE, characteristic of mature asset portfolios. Against this backdrop, SISL's ROCE, while moderating in recent years due to expansion-led capital deployment, continues to outpace several global benchmarks.
