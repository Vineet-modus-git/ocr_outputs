**Pricing trends and forecast:** Colocation rental rates are expected to remain largely stable over the next three years across all three categories—retail, wholesale, and hyperscale. While demand continues to grow steadily, especially from cloud and enterprise segments, increased supply and competitive dynamics are likely to balance demand driven pricing pressures. Regional variations may occur, but overall, the market is projected to maintain a steady pricing environment. Over the past 3 years, hyperscale colocation pricing saw a slight decline; however, this remains debatable due to evolving deal structures and bundled service models.

### 3.5.2 Commercial terms

Generally, the data center operators enter into a Master Service Agreement (MSA) with their clients. Some of the important clauses relate to Hosting Services, Service Level Warranty, Fee, Payment and Term which are discussed below:

* **Hosting services and service levels**

  Hosting services include providing space, infrastructure, and technical support, with terms and fees mutually agreed upon. These services are detailed in the provider's standard documentation, and clients are notified of any material changes. The provider guarantees a specified quarterly uptime for critical services like power, cooling, and network, and offers 24/7 support along with an escalation matrix. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) becomes effective upon signing the Service Installation Report (SIR), with service levels measured from the provisioning date.

* **Service warranties, outages, and termination**

  The MSA includes a service level warranty ensuring 24/7 access to hosted infrastructure, excluding outages caused by scheduled maintenance, customer errors, external threats, or unmanaged equipment. Outages are defined as failures in access, power, cooling, or unnotified downtimes. Clients are entitled to service credits—1-day pro-rata per outage and 0.5-day credit for every 0.05% drop in uptime, capped at 15 days per quarter. Credit requests must be submitted within 7 business days. If uptime falls below 98% for two consecutive quarters, the client may terminate the contract. Termination can also occur for convenience with 90 days' notice or for cause, including material breach, service failure, or monetary default.

* **Typical fee, payment and other important clauses**

  Fees for services are defined in purchase orders, billed in advance, and payable by the due date, with partial months billed on a pro-rata basis. Invoice disputes must be raised within 30 business days. If usage exceeds agreed limits, the provider may charge additional fees with supporting evidence. All fees are exclusive of taxes, which are invoiced as per applicable laws, and customers must provide exemption documentation if applicable. Payments are made net of local withholding taxes, with credits issued upon proof of payment. The MSA also includes standard legal clauses such as force majeure, governing law and dispute resolution, limitation of liability, indemnity, and data privacy.
