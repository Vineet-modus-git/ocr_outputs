After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets (which are categorized as equity instruments) at FVTOCI and financial assets or liabilities that are specifically designated as FVTPL. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be very infrequent. The management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant to the Company's operations. A change in the business model occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change in business model.
