### 1.1.2 Real GDP growth in Emerging Asia vs other economies

Real global GDP growth is expected to be steady in calendar year 2024 and calendar year 2025. However, regional variations have resulted in stronger growth rates in certain areas compared to other regions. Emerging Asia is expected to maintain the highest growth rate, with its Y-o-Y growth rate at 5.3% in calendar year 2024.

This growth is driven by:

* Robust domestic consumption across most ASEAN countries, underpinned by a growing middle class and rising disposable incomes.
* Large-scale public and private investments in China and India, particularly in infrastructure, technology, and manufacturing.

By contrast, advanced economies are expected to post more moderate growth due to subdued demand, tighter financial conditions, and demographic headwinds. As a result, Emerging Asia will remain the primary engine of global growth through the remainder of the decade.

## 1.2 India macroeconomic overview

India continues to maintain a relatively stable macroeconomic environment, with inflation levels remaining below the global average. Backed by effective policy measures and easing food prices, CPI inflation is on a downward trajectory, reinforcing the country's economic resilience amid global uncertainties.

### 1.2.1 Inflation: India vs global

Global inflation rose from 3.5% in calendar year 2019 to 5.7% in calendar year 2024 and is projected to ease to 3.2% in calendar year 2030. Countries heavily reliant on energy imports, such as Germany and the UK, were disproportionately affected by recent supply disruptions, leading to higher inflation levels.
