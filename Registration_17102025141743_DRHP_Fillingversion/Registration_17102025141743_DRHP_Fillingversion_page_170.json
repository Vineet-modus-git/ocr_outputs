While hyperscaler data centers primarily support public cloud services for external customers, captive data centers are dedicated to running the company's own internal workloads and applications. Telco data centers, owned by telecom companies, are increasingly being leveraged for both internal operations like network management, and customer-facing services like cloud or edge computing. In contrast, colocation data centers are shared facilities where multiple businesses rent space for servers and other computing hardware, benefiting from shared infrastructure (power, cooling, security, etc.), leading to reduced capital and operational costs. Unlike captive data centers, colo data centers offer flexibility and cost-efficiency for enterprises that prefer not to build and operate their own data centers.

Their proximity to the network edge significantly reduces latency and enhances real-time data processing. While traditional data centers are classified into Rated 1 to Rated 4, edge data centers typically fall under Rated 1 and Rated 2 due to their compact scale, lower redundancy, and moderate uptime guarantees.
