In a data center, Base Build is the core physical infrastructure and foundational systems that are constructed before any tenant-specific or operational fit-outs. It includes all the essential components that make the building ready to support data center functions, but without the full deployment of IT equipment or custom configurations. There are 3 kinds of Base Builds as mentioned in the above table:

### 2.1.5.2 Land cost analysis for data centers

Land acquisition is one of the most critical cost components in data centers development. Based on the Regional Land Cost Index, data centers real estate costs vary substantially across different clusters within key cities. A cluster is a smaller area within a market/city which comprises of more than one data center. Land costs for data center-suitable clusters in India show wide regional variation, reflecting differences in infrastructure readiness, connectivity, and development stage.

* **Premium clusters:** Mumbai (Powai) and Hyderabad (West) command the highest land prices, with ranges exceeding INR 3.2 lakh/SQM—driven by strong enterprise demand, connectivity, and proximity to key commercial zones. Gurugram and Bengaluru Peripheral South also show high-end values above INR 2.4 lakh/SQM.
* **Mid-range clusters:** Clusters like Thane Belapur Road, Noida, Bengaluru Peripheral East, and Ambattur and Siruseri (Chennai) fall in the mid-cost band, offering a balance of affordability and infrastructure access with high-end values between INR 1.1–INR 2.8 lakh/SQM.
