As far as colocation market capitalization goes, the two major global players present in India collectively account for 40% of the built capacity in India, while SISL holds the 3rd position in the market share with 188.04 MW built capacity as of March 31, 2025 closely followed by Domestic Player 1 with 177 MW. As of March 31, 2025, SISL had a market share by Built IT Capacity of 15.26% in India. This alternately also translates to SISL being one of the top 3 providers of data center colocation services in India, in terms of built IT capacity. Together, the top 10 operators account for 91% of the total colocation data center capacity in India, signifying a strong concentration among few key players."}, {"bbox": [293, 1200, 1602, 1521], "category": "Text", "text": "A significant share of these operators' facilities is concentrated in the Greater Mumbai area, reinforcing the region's status as a core hub. However, a few exceptions are seen with facilities dispersed in other emerging cities such as Chennai and Delhi NCR, indicating a gradual geographic diversification. These cities are demand hubs as they have a dense enterprise presence, hyperscaler activity, and strong internet user base. Mumbai and Chennai become strategic network interconnection points due to subsea cable landings. SISL, maintains a strong operational presence across all demand hubs. Its competitors among the top four operators also have a presence around these demand hubs, which is detailed in subsequent sections. While colocation and hyperscale data centers have expanded significantly, their presence is predominantly limited to the top 10 cities. This concentration has resulted in suboptimal digital experiences in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. To address this disparity, edge data centers are being deployed.

They replicate the functionality of core data centers but with a lower form factor and capacity, ensuring similar uptime performance. By bringing data processing closer to end-users, edge data centers enhance user experiences, support critical applications, and facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies across various sectors and geographies in India.⁵⁰ Hence data center operators are looking at tier 2 and 3 cities such as Jaipur, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Vizag, Lucknow, Patna, and Bhubaneswar for their smaller decentralized Edge facilities. These are expected to play a pivotal role in processing latency-sensitive applications and supporting generative AI service. Consequently, edge data centers bring computational power closer to end-users.⁵¹"}, {"bbox": [293, 2021, 943, 2069], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "50 STT Telemedia GDC - Resources on how edge data centers in India are helping business growth - November 2023\n51 Business Standard - Indian data center industry valuation investment - March 2025"}]
