# ANNEXURE "1" STATEMENT OF SPECIAL TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS UNDER THE APPLICABLE TAX LAWS IN INDIA

The information provided below sets out the possible special direct tax benefits available to the Company and the shareholders of the Company in a summary manner only and is not a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax consequences of the subscription, ownership and disposal of equity shares of the Company, under the current Tax Laws presently in force in India. Several of these benefits are dependent on the shareholders fulfilling the conditions prescribed under the relevant Tax Laws. Hence, the ability of the shareholders to derive the tax benefits is dependent upon fulfilling such conditions, which, based on business / commercial imperatives a shareholder faces, may or may not choose to fulfil. We do not express any opinion or provide any assurance as to whether the Company or its shareholders will continue to obtain these benefits in future. The following overview is not exhaustive or comprehensive and is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice. In view of the individual nature of the tax consequences and the changing tax laws, each investor is advised to consult their own tax consultant with respect to the specific tax implications arising out of their participation in the issue. We are neither suggesting nor are we advising the investor to invest money or not to invest money based on this statement.

The statement below covers only relevant special direct tax law benefits and does not cover benefits under any other law.
