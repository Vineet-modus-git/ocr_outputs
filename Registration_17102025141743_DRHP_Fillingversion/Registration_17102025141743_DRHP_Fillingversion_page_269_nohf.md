WUE is a metric used to measure how efficiently a data center uses water. It was developed by The Green Grid, just like PUE, to track environmental sustainability, though specifically related to water consumption.

The Global players operating in India, monitor and publish their WUE in their sustainability reports at a Global level, while the Indian origin operators have been publishing their commitment to reduce WUE through annual targets to reduce water usage. Global players have reported WUE in the range of 1.5 to 2.8 in their global reports. According to Sify Technologies Limited Integrated report 2023 â€“ 2024, the water usage efficiency has gone up by 16% compared to a baseline year of Fiscal 2022.

## VI. Uptime Guarantee

Uptime is defined as the service provider's commitment to operational availability, typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.999%). It is a key metric for service reliability and SLAs.

Uptime is critical in data centers as it directly impacts business continuity, financial performance, and customer trust. Even brief downtime can lead to significant revenue loss, data risks, and damage to reputation, especially for sectors like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. High availability ensures compliance with regulatory standards, supports data integrity, and enables seamless digital operations. As businesses increasingly rely on digital infrastructure, maintaining maximum uptime is essential to ensure reliability, competitiveness, and operational resilience.
