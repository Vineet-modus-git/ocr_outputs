Data usage increased from 88 EB in Fiscal 2020 to 419 EB in Fiscal 2025, driven by rising smartphone adoption, affordable data rates, the rapid deployment of 5G and rising enterprise consumption. The growth in data center capacity, which grew at a CAGR of 28.1% during Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2025, is driven by the growth in data consumption, which posted a CAGR of 36.7% during Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2025. The data center capacity growth has accompanied both growth in sheer volume of data basis the rising number of internet users and growth in compute requirements. With India now leading in mobile data usage, the demand for scalable and efficient data storage and processing capabilities is becoming increasingly important."}, {"bbox": [294, 443, 1602, 572], "category": "Text", "text": "During the aforementioned period, India's data center capacity has more than doubled, reflecting increased investments in cloud infrastructure and enterprise IT services. While this growth aligns with rising data consumption, it is also propelled by factors such as regulatory support, growing hyperscaler presence, and digital transformation across industries."}, {"bbox": [335, 647, 1602, 1262], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [195, 1317, 774, 1353], "category": "Section-header", "text": "4.1.3 Indian laws promoting data localization"}, {"bbox": [294, 1379, 1602, 1574], "category": "Text", "text": "Data localization involves storing and processing data within a country's borders to meet legal, security, and privacy requirements. Governments enforce it to protect citizen privacy, ensure national control over sensitive data, and strengthen regulatory oversight. It often mandates companies, especially global tech firms, to store certain data like financial or personal information on local servers, supporting domestic digital infrastructure. As a result of increasing data localization and regulatory developments, Indian enterprises are increasingly required to store data within national borders, which drives significant demand for domestic data center capacity."}]
