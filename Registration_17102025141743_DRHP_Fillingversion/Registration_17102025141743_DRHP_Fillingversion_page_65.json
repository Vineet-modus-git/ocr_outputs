The failure to keep our technical knowledge confidential could erode our competitive advantage and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.**\n\nOur technical knowledge is not protected by intellectual property rights such as patents and is principally protected by maintaining its confidentiality. We rely on trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. As a result, we cannot be certain that our know-how will remain confidential in the long run. Employment contracts with certain of our employees who have special technical knowledge about our services or our business contain a general obligation to keep all such knowledge confidential. In addition to the confidentiality provisions, these employment agreements typically contain non-competition clauses. While, to our knowledge, there have not been any instances of technical knowledge loss of leakage in the three months ended June 30, 2025, or during Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, we cannot assure you that we will not experience such losses in the future.\n\nIf any of the confidentiality provisions or the non-competition clauses are unenforceable, we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our knowledge. In the event that confidential technical information or knowledge about our services or business becomes available to third parties or to the public, our competitive advantage over other companies industry could be harmed which could have an adverse material effect on our current business, future prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, any trademarks we may obtain in the future may expire, and no assurance may be given that we will be able to renew them after expiry. As of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has no patents granted to it. Our future patent or trademark applications may not be approved. Although we have not had material instances of infringement of our intellectual property in the three months ended June 30, 2025, or during Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, we may be unable to prevent third parties from seeking to register, acquire, or otherwise obtain intellectual property that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. In addition, our current or future intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Failure to successfully obtain and maintain such registrations could impact our use of such intellectual property rights, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, goodwill, business prospects, and results of operations.\n\nFurther, our proprietary technology platforms are essential to our business. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized use or misappropriation by third parties of such technology platforms, our competitors may be able to mimic our technology platforms or offerings, and enforcing our rights could be time-consuming and expensive, and may not be successful. In addition, third-party providers of software that we license may subject us to claims or litigation to seek damages for violating their licenses and intellectual property rights which could require us to pay damages, enter into expensive license arrangements or modify our services and solutions. We may also face litigation or incur additional fees and be required to pay damages for violating contractual terms, misuse or excessive use of our license to intellectual property rights, which could cause significant damage to our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**45. If we inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.**\n\nWhile we take measures to ensure that we comply with the intellectual property rights of others, we cannot determine with certainty as to whether we are infringing on any existing third-party intellectual property rights, which may force us to alter our technologies, obtain licenses or cease some of our operations. We may also be susceptible to claims from third parties asserting infringement and other related claims. If claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be subject to costly litigation or may be required to obtain a license, modify our existing technology or cease the use of such technology and design a new non-infringing technology. Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly. Further, necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for any past infringement. An inadvertent breach or any misuse of intellectual property or proprietary data by any of our employees or sub-contractors may expose us to expensive infringement claims. While we have not experienced any claims in relation to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others instances in the three months ended June 30, 2025, or during Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, we cannot assure you that we will not become the subject of such claims in the future. The occurrence of any of the foregoing in the future could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n**46. We have indebtedness and have also guaranteed, and provided collateral to secure, certain financing obligations of our Promoters, all these could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.**\n\nThe following table shows our total current and non-current borrowings and as of June 30, 2025, and March 31,"}]
