Any person who becomes a nominee by virtue of the provisions of Section 72 of the Companies Act, 2013 shall upon the production of such evidence as may be required by our Board, elect either:

a) to register himself or herself as the holder of the Equity Shares; or

b) to make such transfer of the Equity Shares, as the deceased holder could have made.

Further, our Board may at any time give notice requiring any nominee to choose either to be registered himself or herself or to transfer the Equity Shares, and if the notice is not complied with within a period of 90 days, the Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, interests, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the Equity Shares, until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

Since the Allotment of Equity Shares in the Offer will be made only in dematerialised mode, there is no need to make a separate nomination with our Company. Nominations registered with respective Depository Participant of the Bidder would prevail. If the Bidder wants to change the nomination, they are requested to inform their respective Depository Participant.
