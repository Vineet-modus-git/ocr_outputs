According to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, Edge data centers are expected to move from being peripheral assets to becoming a vital, independent part of the digital infrastructure landscape. As of June 30, 2025, we had two Edge data centers under development. For more details, refer to “Our Business—Our Strategies” and “Our Business—Edge Data Centers” on pages 287 and 300, respectively. In particular, for us to become a dominant player in the Edge data center space in the future, it is important that we develop our Edge data centers in close proximity to end-users and enterprise hubs. We need to secure adequate land in suitable locations and on acceptable terms to be able to expand our data center footprint and widen our Edge data center presence. While we have been able to secure suitable land for the two Edge data centers that are currently under development, we cannot assure you that all the land we require to implement our growth strategy will be available to us in the future on favorable terms, or at all. Unavailability of land in areas where we may seek to expand our Edge data center presence, including in key coastal cities in India and in close proximity to enterprise hubs, clients and subscribers, may hinder our expansion plans, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."}, {"bbox": [192, 665, 1558, 735], "category": "List-item", "text": "29. **Failure on the part of third-party contractors to carry out various services for us may have a material adverse impact on our business.**"}, {"bbox": [293, 756, 1558, 856], "category": "Text", "text": "We engage third-party contractors in the course of our business for services that include heating ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”), building management services and civil infrastructure maintenance.
