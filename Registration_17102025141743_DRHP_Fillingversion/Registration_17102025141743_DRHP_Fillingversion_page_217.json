Meanwhile, operators are increasingly turning to India to reduce geographical concentration and establish a balanced presence across both western and eastern hemispheres. With Western markets nearing saturation, India and the broader east offer significant headroom for expansion. India also positions itself as an attractive, incentive-rich destinationâ€”unlike more rigid markets such as Singapore, Vietnam, or Thailand, by offering policy-driven support and greater operational flexibility. Strategically, investing in India allows players to counter China's digital dominance and strengthen control over the regional consumer data landscape."}, {"bbox": [290, 412, 1604, 707], "category": "Text", "text": "**India's GDP and ICT investment correlation:** Data centers are a critical component of the ICT ecosystem. Numerous studies have established a strong correlation between ICT infrastructure and GDP growth. Investments in ICT directly contribute to GDP by enhancing productivity and operational efficiency. Conversely, economic expansion drives the demand for more robust ICT infrastructure to sustain and support continued growth. At the end of Q1 2025, India emerged as the 4th largest GDP globally and is slated to be the 3rd largest economy by 2030, estimated to witness a growth of 45% in its GDP between 2025 and 2030. Whereas Asia Pacific's GDP is forecast to increase by 23% between 2025 and 2030. Though currently India's share in data center market in APAC is only 11%, owing to its higher rate of growth in GDP, the country is attracting and will continue to attract higher investments in ICT and inadvertently in data centers."}, {"bbox": [290, 728, 1604, 1118], "category": "Text", "text": "**IT infrastructure density:** Looking at the investment outlook from an IT infrastructure density context is also crucial. Market selection for data center development is influenced by a range of factors, including cloud adoption, digital transformation, commercial activity, economic maturity, and the availability of physical infrastructure. Among these, built IT capacity servicing a nation's population provides as a useful proxy for identifying relative growth opportunities across markets. USA, which is currently the largest data center region by built capacity, saw a very high built capacity per crore of its population in 2024 as shown in the chart below. Despite high value of installed capacity for its population, USA will continue to disproportionately add more data center capacity to have greater built capacity to serve its growing population. Comparing this with Indian landscape, though India built capacity per capita is also going to grow there is still a huge potential gap of infrastructure addition when compared with USA or even Asia Pacific. Currently the Indian data center market is underserviced and to achieve a better MW utilization against the population comparable to the levels of USA or APAC by 2030, it will require significant new investments and available built capacity."}, {"bbox": [442, 1134, 1453, 1732], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [293, 1750, 954, 1783], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: Asia Pacific Data Center Investment Landscape, C&W Research"}, {"bbox": [194, 1805, 1124, 1842], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 3.2.1 Inside the India data center market - trends, growth, and momentum"}, {"bbox": [290, 1865, 1604, 2062], "category": "Text", "text": "India's data center industry is poised for significant expansion, driven by rapid digital transformation and surging demand for cloud services, big data, AI, and IoT.
