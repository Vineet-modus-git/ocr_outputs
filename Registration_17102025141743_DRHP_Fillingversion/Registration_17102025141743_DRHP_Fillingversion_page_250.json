Growing regulatory focus on data residency and financial sector-specific cloud frameworks is expected to accelerate demand. BFSI may also utilize edge data centers more heavily in future, as it helps reduce payment failure rates and reduce latency.\n2. **Technology:** Technology players (including IaaS, SaaS and PaaS firms, alongside firms like Intel, Krutrim, etc.) contribute 27.2% of enterprise data center demand, as these firms mature and Indian economy becomes more digitized, the scale of these technology firms is expected to rise, along with their data center demand.\n3. **Retail and e-commerce:** This segment represents 8.3% of data center demand and is characterized by dynamic workloads driven by real-time analytics, transactions, and peak seasonality. Players prioritize scalability, low-latency APIs, and strong content delivery infrastructure. With increasing use of AI and personalization, data center usage is expected to grow steadily, especially across non-metro regions.\n4. **Telecommunications:** Telcos account for 7.8% of data center demand, driven by core network operations, 5G rollout, and digital services. Most players operate captive infrastructure but selectively partner with hyperscalers for specific workloads. Future demand growth is expected through rising digitization, especially growth of media and entertainment related offerings.\n5. **Media and entertainment:** Contributing 4.4% of data center demand, this segment includes OTT platforms and broadcasters with high storage and distribution needs. While storage is predictable, delivery infrastructure must scale rapidly during events. With HD and immersive formats gaining traction, demand is expected to rise further.\n6. **Government:** Government share in enterprise data center demand is expected to grow steadily. While many workloads remain in captive setups, adoption of third-party data centers is increasing, particularly for platforms like DigiLocker, UIDAI and GSTN, through empanelment of third-party data centers.

Latency-critical offerings such as live streaming, online gaming, real-time video conferencing, and high-frequency trading are particularly sensitive to delays, where even milliseconds can impact user satisfaction or result in lost revenue. In sectors where customer experience is a competitive advantage, such as BFSI, e-commerce, telecommunications, and media, reducing latency not only enhances customer experience but also improves operational efficiency and drives profitability, thus posing an additional demand for data centers capable of catering to such requirements. edge data centers are expected to play an important role in meeting this additional demand, as these trends necessitate ultra-low latency and localized data processing, making edge data centers"}]
