historical loss rates reflecting current condition and forecasts of future economic conditions. In this approach assets are grouped on the basis of similar credit characteristics such as industry, customer segment, past due status and other factors which are relevant to estimate the expected cash loss from these assets.

(ii) Other financial assets

Other financial assets are tested for impairment based on significant change in credit risk since initial recognition and impairment is measured based on probability of default over the lifetime when there is significant increase in credit risk.

(b) **Financial Liabilities**

*Initial recognition and measurement*

Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and any transaction cost that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial liabilities except financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value.

*Subsequent measurement*

The financial liabilities are classified for subsequent measurement into following categories: (i) at amortized cost and (ii) at fair value through profit or loss

(i) Financial liabilities at amortized cost

The company is classifying the following financial liabilities at amortized cost: (i) compulsorily convertible debentures, (ii) borrowings from banks, (iii) borrowings from others, (iv) finance lease liabilities, (v) trade payables and (vi) other financial liabilities.

Amortized cost for financial liabilities represents amount at which financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount.

(ii) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at FVTPL.

*Compound Financial Instrument*

The terms of a non-derivative compound financial instrument are evaluated to determine whether it contains both a liability and an equity component. Such components are classified as financial liabilities, financial assets or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Interest, dividends and gains relating to the component that is financial liability is recognized as income or expense in profit or loss. Distribution to holders of equity instruments is recognized directly in equity.

*Derecognition of financial liabilities*

A financial liability shall be derecognized when, and only when, it is extinguished i.e., when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

(c) **Derivative financial instruments**

Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are entered into by the Company to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with certain payables, receivables and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. The Company also enters into cross currency and interest rate swaps for hedging the risk against variability in cash flows of its term loan. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, and are initially recognized at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are recognized in profit or loss.

(d) **Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities**

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of assets and liabilities when, and only when, the Company has a legal right to offset the recognized amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously.

(e) **Reclassification of Financial Assets**
