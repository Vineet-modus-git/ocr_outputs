### Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation. Typically the Company ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses, servicing of financial obligations. In addition, the Company has concluded arrangements with well reputed Banks, and has unused lines of credit that could be drawn upon should there be a need. The Company is also in the process of negotiating additional facilities with Banks for funding its requirements.

The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:
