Potential effects of natural disasters may include damage to infrastructure and the loss of business continuity and business information. While our operations are generally not susceptible to interruption by localized natural disasters, because we are able to, for example, transfer information into the cloud, or utilize alternate data center locations for operations while one data center location is impacted, any widespread natural disaster could materially impact our ability to operate. In addition, natural disasters may impact our ability to progress the development of data centers, lead to delays in construction of commencement of operations, and generally expose us to cost overruns. If our facilities are affected by any of these events, our operations may be significantly interrupted, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations."}, {"bbox": [192, 572, 1559, 644], "category": "List-item", "text": "69. **Financial difficulty and other problems relating to financial institutions in India could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.**"}, {"bbox": [293, 663, 1559, 1017], "category": "Text", "text": "We are exposed to the risks of the Indian financial system which may be affected by the financial difficulties faced by certain Indian financial institutions whose commercial soundness may be closely related as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships. This risk, which is sometimes referred to as a “systemic risk”, may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as credit rating agencies, banks, security trustees, and stock exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis. Any such difficulties or instability of the Indian financial system in general could create adverse market perceptions about the Indian financial institutions and banks and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing and consequently, our business. In addition, we deal with various financial institutions in our business. Any one of them could be negatively affected by financial difficulty as a result of occurrences over which we have no control.

Under current Indian regulations, transfers of shares between non-residents and residents are permitted (subject to certain exceptions) if they comply with, among other things, the guidelines specified by the RBI in relation to pricing and valuation of such shares and certain reporting requirements for such transactions specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares is not in compliance with such pricing guidelines or reporting requirements or falls under any of the exceptions specified by the RBI, the prior approval of the RBI will be required before any such transfer may be consummated.
