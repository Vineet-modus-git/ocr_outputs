As customer expectations evolve and regulatory standards tighten, financial institutions are increasingly adopting data-centric, technology-led operating models. data centers play a critical role by ensuring secure transactions, safeguarding sensitive information, and supporting complex, high-volume operations. Institutions like HDFC and SBI follow a hybrid approach, hosting front-end applications on the cloud while keeping core systems on-premise. The heightened focus on compliance and security in the BFSI sector has created opportunities for data center providers who can demonstrate robust security credentials and regulatory adherence. SISL distinguishes itself as a trusted digital infrastructure provider for the BFSI sector in India by emphasizing stringent compliance and robust security measures, validated through globally recognized standards such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, SSAE18 SOC 1 & 2, ISO 27017/27018, and TIA-942 Rated-4."}, {"bbox": [361, 1396, 1556, 2081], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"5\">Use cases of data centers in BFSI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div><p>Core banking & transaction processing</p><ul><li>Hosting core banking systems for real-time transaction processing</li><li>Supporting ATM networks, mobile banking, and online payment gateways with low-latency connectivity</li></ul></div></td><td><div><p>Customer data management</p><ul><li>Secure storage of sensitive customer data such as KYC information, account details, and credit scores</li><li>Data centers support the implementation of encryption and tokenization to safeguard financial transactions</li></ul></div></td><td><div><p>Fraud detection & risk analytics</p><ul><li>Fraud detection using AI/ML needs real-time data processing, supported by fast and secure data centers</li><li>Big data analytics used for credit risk assessment and anti-money laundering relies on the scalable infrastructure of data centers to securely manage and process complex datasets</li></ul></div></td><td><div><p>Integrated fintech ecosystem</p><ul><li>Data centers enable seamless connectivity between banks, fintech firms, and consumers by supporting advanced technologies</li><li>Fintech solutions like payment and investment apps are transforming how financial services are delivered, creating a growing demand for modern data center infrastructure</li></ul></div></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>"}]
