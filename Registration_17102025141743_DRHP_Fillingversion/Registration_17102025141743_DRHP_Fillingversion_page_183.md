The selection of an appropriate HVAC cooling system for data centers requires a careful evaluation of multiple factors, including energy efficiency, capital and operational costs, scalability, and environmental impact. The suitable use cases for cooling systems based on their efficiency, deployment time, CapEx/OpEx and scalability are mentioned in the above table. As data centers demand continue to rise, deploying a strategic mix of these cooling technologies will be critical to achieving optimized performance, energy conservation, and sustainable growth.

### 2.1.3.2 Types of Cooling in Data Centers

Cooling systems are critical to ensuring the reliability, performance, and longevity of data center infrastructure. As computing power and rack densities continue to increase, driven by AI, HPC, and cloud workloads, data centers are evolving beyond traditional air-cooling systems. Advanced cooling technologies such as liquid cooling and hybrid systems are gaining traction for their efficiency in managing high thermal loads. Selecting the right cooling strategy depends on factors like power density, geographic location, sustainability goals, and cost considerations. An optimized cooling system not only enhances operational efficiency but also contributes significantly to a data center's energy usage effectiveness (PUE) and carbon footprint.

**Air cooling**

Air cooling leverages air conditioning systems, fans, and vents to circulate ambient air and dissipate the heat generated by computing equipment. As the most established method of thermal management, it remains widely used across data centers of all sizes. For less power-dense workloads, such as AI inferencing, air cooling is often sufficient, as machine learning tasks typically generate lower thermal loads. Its simplicity and scalability make it a viable option for both large-scale and edge deployments. However, air cooling is generally effective for rack densities up to 20 kW in conventional setups. While enhanced configurations can support up to 35 kW per rack, workloads exceeding these thresholds usually necessitate liquid cooling solutions, whether direct-to-chip, immersion, or hybrid systems, for optimal thermal performance and energy efficiency.

**Liquid cooling**

Liquid cooling methods provide a more energy-efficient and sustainable solution compared to traditional air cooling, enabling better performance and support for high-density computing environments. Leading data center operators in India are either implementing or preparing to adopt liquid cooling technologies. The different types of Liquid cooling systems are mentioned below.

* **Liquid immersion cooling:** Liquid Immersion Cooling (LIC) is an innovative cooling technique used in data centers, where hardware like servers is submerged in a non-conductive dielectric fluid that absorbs heat directly from the components. The process enhances cooling efficiency, supports higher-density server configurations, and reduces overall energy consumption. It is especially effective for high-performance computing (HPC), AI-driven operations, and large-scale data centers. In addition to cutting down on operational noise and mechanical wear, it helps lower long-term costs.
* **Direct contact liquid cooling:** Direct Contact Liquid Cooling (DCLC) is a specialized cooling technique in data centers where a non-conductive liquid directly cools key heat-producing components like CPUs and GPUs. Unlike full immersion methods, DCLC uses cold plates attached to these components, with liquid circulating through them to extract heat effectively. This method provides precise, high-efficiency cooling, making it well-suited for dense server setups, AI processing, and high-performance computing.
* **Direct-to-chip cooling:** In this method coolant flows through cold plates mounted directly on high-heat components such as CPUs, GPUs, and memory. These cold plates absorb and transfer the heat to the
