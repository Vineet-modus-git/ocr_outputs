For example, Google reported that its AI-enabled cooling and hardware management system resulted in over 30% operational cost savings. Google DeepMind's AI algorithms optimized cooling systems, achieving a 40% reduction in energy consumption."}, {"bbox": [291, 891, 1577, 1093], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Enhanced security:** AI-powered systems analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, quickly identifying anomalies that may signal security threats. These systems continuously learn from past incidents, improving their ability to detect and respond to threats effectively. AI automates security responses, enabling faster reactions to breaches. When a threat is detected, AI can immediately trigger protocols like isolating systems or alerting administrators. This rapid response significantly reduces the risk of data breaches, making AI crucial for maintaining data center security."}, {"bbox": [291, 1118, 653, 1155], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Accommodating the AI trend"}, {"bbox": [291, 1179, 1159, 1216], "category": "Text", "text": "To accommodate the rising trend of AI, data centers are taking various steps:"}, {"bbox": [291, 1234, 1553, 1853], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [306, 1873, 484, 1899], "category": "Text", "text": "Source(s): 1Lattice analysis"}, {"bbox": [192, 1921, 702, 1958], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 2.2.1.1 Storage solutions for data centers"}]
