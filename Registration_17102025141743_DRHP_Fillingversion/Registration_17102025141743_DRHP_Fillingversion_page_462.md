Company. The gratuity fund is managed by the HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited. The company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting any unrecognized past service cost and the fair value of any plan assets.

The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Companyâ€™s obligations. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the total of any unrecognized past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented within equity. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Service costs, net interest expenses and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.

## Short term benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Compensated absences

The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absence. The employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized accrued absence and utilize it in future periods or receive cash compensation at retirement or termination of employment for the unutilized accrued compensated absence. The Company recognizes an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services. The Company provides for the expected cost of compensated absence in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated based on actuarial valuations carried out by an independent actuary at the balance sheet date.

## Share-based Payment Transactions

The employees of the Company are entitled to participate in Associate Stock Option Plan (ASOP) where the employees are issued options to purchase shares of the Holding Company subject to vesting period. Accordingly, the fair value of option on the Grant date is amortized over the vesting period with a corresponding liability recognized against the Holding Company, which will issue shares on exercise.

## Provisions

Provisions are recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.

A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Revenue Recognition

The Company derives revenue from data center services.

## Data Center Services

Revenue from data center services consists co-location of racks and power charges billed to customers. The contracts are mainly for a fixed rate for a period of time. Revenue from co-location of racks, power charges and interconnect charges are series of distinct services where the performance obligations are completed. Service revenue is recognized as the related services are performed. Sale of equipment such as servers, switches, networking equipment, cable infrastructure and racks etc., are accounted as separate performance obligations if they are distinct and its related revenues are recognized at a point in time when the control is passed on to the customer.
