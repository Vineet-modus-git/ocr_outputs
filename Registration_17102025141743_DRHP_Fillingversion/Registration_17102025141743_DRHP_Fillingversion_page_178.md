3. Augmented global connectivity by new cables facilitating improved connectivity at lower costs catalyzing a positive loop for greater demand.
4. An improved regulatory environment for locating data centers and submarine cables.

**NLD (National Long Distance) service** refers to the telecommunications service that enables long-distance voice and data communication between different telecom circles or regions. NLD networks are essential for interconnecting data centers across cities, facilitating high-speed and high-capacity data transmission and therefore ensuring low-latency, reliable backbone connectivity. NLD licenses are issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), and licensed players build fiber infrastructure to serve both telecom and data center needs. RailTel is a prominent NLD service provider in India, offering services over its own network.

### D. Favorable regulatory framework

India's regulatory environment for submarine cable infrastructure is governed by a structured telecom licensing regime, which is split between the **Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)** and the **Department of Telecommunications (DoT)** under the Ministry of Communications.

**ILD licensing requirement:** Entities laying submarine cables in India's Territorial Waters must obtain an International Long Distance (ILD) License from the DoT. Licensed operators (ILDOs) are authorized to establish Cable Landing Stations (CLS) and facilitate cable landings as per TRAI regulations.

**TRAI's new recommendations – 2023 Update:** In 2023, TRAI released its recommendations on the licensing framework and regulatory mechanism to amend the existing system of permits and ease the rules of setting up CLS in India. As of June 19, 2023, TRAI proposed a two-tier CLS classification to enhance network flexibility, redundancy, and regional access. Primary facilities where submarine cables directly land on Indian shores and secondary extensions of main CLS or CLS Points of Presence (CLS-PoPs), allowing for regional interconnectivity and wider domestic dispersion. This regulatory move is intended to decentralize cable landing access, reduce latency in underserved regions, and promote carrier-neutral infrastructure, making India a more attractive hub for global internet and data traffic.

Separately, there is a category of Open Cable Landing Stations (OCLS) which are established by non-telecom providers and are neutral in nature and not bound to their international partners.

#### 2.1.2.2 Policy level interventions for data centers and their implications on data center growth

As India positions itself to become a global data hub, robust policy frameworks and targeted regulatory interventions have emerged as essential enablers of data centers growth. The evolution of India's policy environment—from the strategic vision of the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP), 2018 to the detailed operational guidelines proposed by the TRAI in 2022 which are mentioned previously in the document.
