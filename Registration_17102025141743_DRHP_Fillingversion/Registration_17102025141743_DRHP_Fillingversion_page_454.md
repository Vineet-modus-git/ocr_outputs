## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

## Related Party Transactions

We enter into various transactions with related parties in the ordinary course of business. These transactions principally include issues of debentures, expenses transfers, revenue transfers, interest payment on loans and CCDs, repayment of capital advances, lease rentals and remuneration paid to Key Managerial Personnel. For further information relating to our related party transactions, see “Restated Consolidated Financial Information- Note 34 - Related parties and transactions” on page 407.

## Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Market Risks

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Our overall risk management program focuses on identifying and analyzing the risks faced by us, to set appropriate risk limits and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. We review our risk management policies and procedures, and the adequacy of our risk management systems periodically to reflect changes in market conditions and our Company’s activities. The Board of Directors is assisted in its oversight role by the Internal Audit. The Internal Audit undertakes reviews of risk management controls and procedures and reports the results to the Board of Directors. For further information, see “Restated Consolidated Financial Information – Notes to Restated Consolidated Financial Information – Note 36. Financial risk management” on page 419.

### Credit Risk

We are subject to credit risks if our clients or other counterparties to a financial instrument fail to meet their contractual commitments to us. Our credit risk arises principally from the Company’s trade receivables, treasury operations and other activities that are in the nature of leases. We typically manage our credit risks through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of our clients. We provide for allowances and doubtful debts and impairments that represent our estimates of trade receivables.

### Liquidity Risk

Our liquidity risk relates to our inability to meet our contractual obligations associated with our financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset as they fall due. We manage the liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that we will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation. Typically, we ensure that we have sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses and servicing of financial obligations. In addition, we have concluded arrangements with financial institutions and have unused lines of credit that could be drawn upon should there be a need.

### Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk with respect to the loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables. We are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk (currency risk), interest rate risk and the market value of our investments. Our exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies. We further segregate market risk as (i) currency risk and (ii) interest rate risk.

#### Currency risk

We face exchange rate risk because certain of our obligations are denominated in foreign currencies, while our functional currency is the Indian rupee. We manage currency risk by (i) forecasting inflows and outflows dominated in US$ for a 12-month period, (ii) estimating the net-exposure in foreign currency in terms of timing and amount, (iii) determining the extent to which exposure should be protected through one or more risk-mitigating instruments to maintain the permissible limits of uncovered exposures, and (iv) carrying out a variance analysis between estimate and actual on an ongoing basis, and taking stop-loss action when the adverse movements breach the 5% barrier of deviation, subject to review by the Board of Directors.
