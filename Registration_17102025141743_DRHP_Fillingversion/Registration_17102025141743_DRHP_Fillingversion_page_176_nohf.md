<table><thead><tr><td>Sl. No.</td><td>Parameter</td><td>Importance for data center development</td><td>Ideal condition for operators</td><td>Location considerations</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td>latency, and seamless scalability for data centers.</td><td>adopt star topology for cabling, use a minimum of Cat 6A copper cabling and OM4 fiber optics<sup>12</sup>, ensure copper cable lengths do not exceed 100 meters, maintain grounding resistance below 5 ohms.</td><td>reliability, latency, and downtime. Coastal cities such as Mumbai and Chennai have well-established submarine cables and high fiber density, enhancing connectivity both globally and domestically.</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Physical and cybersecurity</td><td>Multi-layered physical security and robust cybersecurity frameworks are critical to protect data center assets from both physical breaches and cyber threats.</td><td>An ideal facility should implement at least 6 layers of physical security, maintain 24x7 CCTV surveillance, enforce biometric access controls, and comply with ISO 27001 standards while adopting a Zero Trust security architecture<sup>13</sup>.</td><td>Not a location specific parameter. Security depends on the design, technology and controls deployed at respective data centers.</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Compliance, data sovereignty and certification</td><td>Compliance with global standards and Indian data sovereignty laws builds customer trust and ensures legal operational continuity.</td><td>Data centers must be certified for ISO 27001 (Information Security), ISO 20000-1 (Service Management), and ISO 9001 (Quality Management). It should also be MeitY empaneled for at least five years and guarantee 100% data residency within India.<sup>14</sup></td><td>Mumbai's ecosystem has the highest MeitY empanelment, followed by Delhi-Noida and Pune clusters<sup>15</sup>.</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Growth, scalability and future-proofing</td><td>Modular and scalable data center designs enable businesses to expand efficiently without costly downtime or migration challenges.</td><td>Facilities must allow for 20-30% future space expansion, provision of additional racks in coming years, maintain clear ceiling heights of at least 3.6 meters<sup>16</sup>, and use raised floors between for flexibility.</td><td>Not only a location specific parameter. Scalability and future proofing will depend on the space availability, design and technology deployed at respective data centers.</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Sustainability and green certifications</td><td>Green-certified, energy-efficient data centers support ESG goals, reduce carbon footprints, and appeal to environmentally conscious enterprises.</td><td>By 2030, data centers must use 50% or more renewable energy and aim for top-tier green certifications like IGBC Platinum or LEED Gold/Platinum ratings<sup>17</sup>.</td><td>Not a location specific parameter. Certifications are based on the design and technical specifications of respective data center developments.</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Infrastructure and workspace amenities</td><td>High-quality infrastructure and staff-friendly amenities improve operational resilience, staff efficiency, and customer satisfaction.</td><td>An ideal setup should offer â‰¥99.995% uptime through robust SLAs, plan for Racks and Server refreshes every 3-5 years, maintain at least 48 hours of onsite diesel fuel for backup generators, and provide secure, modular workspaces with UPS-backed power<sup>18</sup>.</td><td>Not a location specific parameter.</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Containment and Airflow Management</td><td>Efficient airflow management reduces cooling energy costs, extends equipment life, and maintains optimal environmental conditions.</td><td>Full hot aisle/cold aisle containment must be implemented, supported by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling to optimize airflow patterns and minimize cooling inefficiencies<sup>19</sup>.</td><td>Not a location specific parameter. It will depend on the design and technical specifications of respective data center developments.</td></tr></tbody></table>
