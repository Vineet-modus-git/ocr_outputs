It has firmly established itself as a central hub for data centers in India. The city's strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and robust telecommunications network have catapulted it as a key location in the global data center ecosystem as well as in APAC region. Over the past few years, Mumbai has witnessed significant investments from cloud service providers such as Hyperscaler 1 and global colocation operators such as Global Player 1 and Global Player 2, alongside strong growth from domestic operators such as SISL and Domestic Player 1. A notable trend in the Mumbai market is that 98% of the current built data center capacity is through colocation.
