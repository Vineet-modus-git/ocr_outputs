Access to secure, uninterrupted power and energy efficiency are essential elements of the data center industry. Key pillars of data center operational efficiency include:"}, {"bbox": [290, 1134, 1602, 2073], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Data center uptime and reliability:** The uninterrupted availability of a data center for client operations is referred to as uptime. It's a critical metric that reflects the reliability, resilience, and performance of the facility. It is often quantified through uptime percentages exceeding 99.9%, although the actual uptime can vary depending on the data center tier used. This is achieved by implementing redundant systems for power, cooling, and network infrastructure.\n* **Performance monitoring:** Monitoring is the process of collecting data about the various components of the data center infrastructure, including servers, storage devices, and network components. Threshold-based alerts and regular tuning cycles ensure optimal performance and minimal service disruptions. The systems monitored include:\n  * Power sources: UPS (batteries, fuses/breakers, transfer switches), power generators (voltage, fuel level, temperature, oil level, etc.), utility grid\n  * Power distribution (rack and floor power distribution units, remote power panels, rack automatic transfer switches, busways)\n  * HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, CRAC units, etc.)\n  * Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, airflow)\n  * Physical security (smoke/fire detectors, doors, door locks, access control units, cameras, etc.)\n* **Security surveillance system:** Data center security systems encompass a comprehensive set of measures and technologies designed to protect the physical infrastructure, digital assets, and operations within a data center facility. A robust system includes layered physical and cyber protections such as biometric access control, 24/7 video surveillance, and intrusion detection. It also incorporates fire suppression, environmental monitoring, and advanced network security measures like firewalls and encryption. These integrated components work in unison to ensure continuous, secure, and resilient operations. By defending against physical breaches, cyber threats, and environmental hazards, a strong data center security system minimizes downtime and data loss while ensuring regulatory compliance, business continuity, operational efficiency and client trust. Cybersecurity is especially critical, requiring adherence to industry-recognized frameworks and certifications such as ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, and PCI DSS to demonstrate a commitment to data integrity, confidentiality, and risk mitigation."}]
