Customers often colocate expensive hardware in the facility. Relocating this equipment involves significant time, cost, and risk of downtime. Most data center services (especially colocation and wholesale) are tied to multi-year contracts (typically more than 3 years going up to 10 years), with strong financial and legal disincentives for early termination. The mission critical nature of data centers makes them almost churn proof except when a contingency occurs such as power black outs or natural calamities such as floods or earthquakes that might render a data center inoperable, forcing customers to switch data center colocation."}, {"bbox": [293, 968, 707, 1006], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## VIII.
