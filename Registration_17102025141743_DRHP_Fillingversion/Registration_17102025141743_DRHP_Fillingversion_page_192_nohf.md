* **Blended power models:** Combining solar/wind with nuclear or emerging sources like tidal, supported by RECs and energy storage, can ensure high uptime and sustainable operations.

### 2.1.4.6 Redundancy in power supply infrastructure

Redundancy in power supply is a critical criterion for evaluating a city's readiness to support hyperscale and colocation data centers. It refers to the ability of the power infrastructure to continue delivering uninterrupted electricity even in the event of failure of a component, feeder, or main source. Data centers typically require N+1, N+2, or 2N redundancy, depending on their rating (as per Uptime Institute standards).

**I. Data center industry technical specifications:**

Data center infrastructure is classified using globally recognized standards such as Uptime Institute's Tier Standards, Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), and more which help benchmark the reliability, redundancy, and maintainability of a facility. These standards range from Rated 1(basic infrastructure) to Rated 4(fault-tolerant infrastructure) or Tier 1 (basic infrastructure) to Tier 4 (fault-tolerant infrastructure) as per TIA-942, offering a progressive hierarchy of availability and system design sophistication.

**II. Industry adoption trends**

With increasing demand for 24/7 digital services (digital commerce, digital entertainment, and social media) businesses are shifting from Rated 1,2 toward Rated 3 and Rated 4 data centers, balancing high uptime with operational sustainability. Hyperscalers and large cloud service providers often develop custom performance standards beyond traditional tiers, prioritizing energy efficiency, modular scalability, and localized redundancies.⁴³

### 2.1.4.7 Green certification and ESG alignment

**I. The growing imperative for sustainable data centers:**

With India's data center footprint expected to grow at a strong pace, sustainability is no longer a value-add—it is a core operational requirement. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), data centers and transmission networks account for 1–1.5% of global electricity use and approximately 1% of energy-related GHG emissions. These figures are expected to grow as internet traffic continues to surge and digital infrastructure expands.⁴⁴

In this context, the role of green certifications, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) alignment, and sustainable design practices are increasingly becoming central to how Data centers are planned, constructed, and operated.

**II. Parameters defining data centers sustainability:**

Data centers' performance on environmental parameters is commonly evaluated using the following parameters. Improvements in these metrics directly impact both operational cost and ESG alignment, and are increasingly monitored by tenants, regulators, and investors alike.

* **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE):** A lower PUE (closer to 1) indicates higher energy efficiency, with minimal losses to lighting, cooling, and power distribution.
* **Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE):** Indicates the volume of water used in relation to IT equipment energy consumption. A lower WUE reflects more efficient cooling practices.
* **Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE):** Measures carbon emissions per unit of IT energy consumed. A CUE closer to zero reflects a carbon-efficient facility.
