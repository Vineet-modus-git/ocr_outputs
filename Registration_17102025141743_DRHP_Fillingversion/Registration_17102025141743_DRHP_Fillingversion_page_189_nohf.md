### 2.1.4.3 Grid reliability

Grid reliability plays a critical role in the functioning of data centers, especially hyperscale facilities that demand uninterrupted power to maintain uptime and ensure service continuity. Grid reliability refers to the operational stability and resilience of the electricity supply network—measured not just by available capacity, but by how often and for how long customers experience power outages.

**I. Two key indices are used to assess this:**

1. **SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index):** Reflects the total duration (in minutes per customer per year) of non-momentary electric interruptions. Higher values indicate longer outages, signifying lower reliability.

2. **SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index):** Indicates the number of times a customer, on average, experiences a non-momentary interruption in a year. Higher values represent frequent interruptions, implying less stable service.³⁶

These indices provide insight into the quality and reliability of power supply at the consumer level, offering a performance-oriented complement to installed capacity figures.

* Year-on-year trend in Tamil Nadu indicates consistently low outage frequency and duration over the past 3 years, suggesting towards being highly conducive for establishing hyperscale data centers with a minimal need for backup power.
* Delhi exhibits high grid reliability with minimal interruptions, despite limited installed capacity. Its stable power delivery system, suitable for Rated 3 and 4 data centers operations with reduced dependency on captive power solutions.
* Maharashtra's performance indicates moderate and improving reliability, although still higher than top-performing states. Urban pockets like Mumbai and Pune have superior grid performance, making them more attractive for data center investments.

### 2.1.4.4 Electricity cost and incentives

Electricity pricing and fiscal incentives remain a critical determinant in the site selection and operational viability of data centers, given the high-power requirements for 24x7 uptime. The electricity cost landscape across key Indian states reflects significant variation, influenced by tariff structures, consumer categorization, and state-level taxes or surcharges. This section evaluates these parameters across major data centers hubs, including Delhi NCR, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal.

**I. Commercial tariffs vs. industrial for data centers:**

While data centers are typically categorized under industrial tariff structures due to their high-load, infrastructure-intensive nature, it is important to recognize that classification practices may vary across states and distribution companies (DISCOMs). In some jurisdictions, particularly where specific policies for data centers are absent or under development, initial electricity connections may be provisioned under commercial categories—resulting in significantly higher tariffs.
