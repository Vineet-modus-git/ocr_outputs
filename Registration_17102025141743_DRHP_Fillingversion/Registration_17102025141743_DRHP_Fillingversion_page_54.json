In addition, the Tower 5 facility at our Rabale Data Center campus and the Tower B facility at the Noida 02 Data Center have received certifications from IGBC. Our service providers for the products used in our data centers have to submit their products for energy efficiency rating to IGBC. Only post-certification are these products implemented in our data centers.
