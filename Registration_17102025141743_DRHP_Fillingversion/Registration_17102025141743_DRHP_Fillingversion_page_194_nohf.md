**V. Key guidelines and design principles for green data centers**

It is critical to incorporate the green design building blueprint which is concise yet comprehensive guide outlining sustainable practices and features across the lifecycle of a data center, from site selection to operations. Some of the key aspects are covered below.⁴⁶

* **Green power provisioning:** Minimum 35% green power is required; operators aim to scale this by 3-5x
* **Efficient cooling systems:** Shift to liquid cooling to reduce energy load
* **Waste segregation:** Dedicated wet, dry, and e-waste handling
* **Water conservation:** Use of treated wastewater, rainwater harvesting, WUE targets
* **Indoor air quality:** Adherence to ASHRAE 62.1-2010, ISO Class 8 standards
* **Sustainable Non-IT loads:** Provision of rooftop solar (3-5% of total consumption)
* **Smart management:** Use of real-time energy monitoring, predictive analytics, and AI/ML for energy optimization

**2.1.5 Construction aspects of data centers**

The construction of data centers in India is influenced by multiple factors, including Design, location, scalability, modular construction feasibility, availability of power infrastructure and skilled workforce for the data center. Developing an advanced data center is a highly complex undertaking that requires multi-functional expertise and substantial up-front capital expenditure. The cost dynamics vary significantly across major data centers hubs such as Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata affecting the financial feasibility and expansion strategies of new and existing data centers. Beyond proximity to demand hubs and connectivity infrastructure, several location-specific factors such as seismic zone classification, flood risk, and climatic conditions directly influence the size or permissible capacity, design specifications and scalability of a data center.

India is rapidly positioning itself as a key data centers hub in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Despite a recent increase in construction costs, the country remains one of the most cost-competitive locations for data center investments. With the lowest power tariffs in the region, stable power supply, and a growing renewable energy capacity, India presents a compelling case for data centers operators looking to expand in APAC.

**2.1.5.1 Specifications and key assumptions**

The low, mid and high range specifications are elaborated in the following pages for base build, fit out and land models. The low, mid and high-cost ranges are provided as a benchmark across the various categories.
