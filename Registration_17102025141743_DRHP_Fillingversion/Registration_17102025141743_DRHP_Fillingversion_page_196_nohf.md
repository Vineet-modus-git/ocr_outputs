* **Value/emerging clusters:** Panvel (Mumbai) and South Hyderabad represent cost-effective options, with low-end values starting as low as INR 10,000–INR 11,000/SQM. These clusters are suited for long-term or greenfield data center investments where cost optimization is a priority.

### 2.1.5.3 Cost remains a critical advantage for India in attracting data center investments

The cost of data center construction varies significantly across global markets. India's construction cost per megawatt remains among the most cost-effective, making it an attractive destination for hyperscale and colocation data centers. In 2024, India recorded one of the highest increases in data center construction costs in APAC, with a 5% rise due to escalating land prices, higher demand for power infrastructure, and the development of AI-ready workload/high-specification facilities. This increase reflects the significant build activity currently underway across major data centers hubs in India. Despite the rise, India remains more affordable than mature markets such as Japan and Australia, benefiting from abundant land availability, a deep and increasingly experienced pool of contractors, and relatively lower entry costs, making it an ever more investable market.

India's favorable cost environment for data center construction is highlighted in the Turner and Townsend Data centre cost index (DCCI) 2024, which benchmarks the construction costs across 50 major global markets. Mumbai's data center cost index of 0.60 is one of the lowest. The only major market with a lower cost index is Shanghai (0.55). In contrast Tokyo and Singapore have one of the highest data center cost indexes of 1.3 and 1.25, respectively. London with a DCCI of 1.0 and North Virginia, the largest data center market in the world and with a DCCI of 0.95 serve as useful reference point and reinforce the cost advantages of constructing a data center in Mumbai and in India. This positions India with a clear competitive edge, offering construction costs significantly lower than those in many developed markets.⁴⁷
