However, as occupancy improves and the facility nears stabilization, operating leverage comes into play, driving RoCE meaningfully higher. Importantly, direct costs as a share of revenue remain relatively stable over time, rising modestly year-on-year, ensuring that profitability is not materially diluted. RoCE is further supported by limited reinvestment requirements post-commissioning and high-margin recurring revenue from contracted clients.\n* **IRR** reflects the time-weighted cash flow profile of the project.
