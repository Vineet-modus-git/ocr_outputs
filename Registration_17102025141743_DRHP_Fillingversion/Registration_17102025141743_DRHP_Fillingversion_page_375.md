Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. To the extent the Company borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Company determines the amount of borrowings costs eligible for capitalization by applying a capitalization rate to the expenditure incurred on such asset. The capitalization rate is determined based on the weighted average of borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the Company which are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically towards purchase of the qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs that the Company capitalizes during a period does not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during that period.

### 16. Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.

Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences:

(i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss,

(ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

(iii) arising due to taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill, as the same is not deductible for tax purposes.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.

### 17. Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Where ordinary shares are issued but not fully paid, they are treated in the calculation of basic earnings per share as a fraction of an ordinary share to the extent that they were entitled to participate in dividends during the period relative to a fully paid ordinary share. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. To the extent that partly paid shares are not entitled to participate in dividends during the period, they are treated as the equivalent of warrants or options in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

### 18. Fair value measurement

A number of the Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
