energy is often harnessed through rooftop or ground-mounted photovoltaic systems, especially in regions with high solar irradiance. Wind power via utility-scale wind farms or direct procurement agreements offers a scalable solution for powering large data center campuses. In certain geographies, hydropower provides a stable, low-carbon energy supply. Many hyperscalers and colocation providers are now integrating these sources through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), green tariffs, or on-site generation, aligning their sustainability commitments with operational resilience and long-term cost efficiency.

Meanwhile, Nuclear power is also vital to cater for the constant, high energy demands of AI-driven data centers. Unlike intermittent renewables, nuclear offers reliable, 24/7 output. Although it is costly to build, reactors provide low operating costs and scalable generation—typically 800+ MW is produced by a reactor—making them a dependable energy solution. The Union Budget 2025 – 2026 has allocated INR 20,000 crore for R&D in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), targeting at least five indigenously designed operational SMRs by 2033. This aligns with India's target of 100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047.⁴⁰ Some of the key benefits of nuclear energy in data centers are outlined below.⁴¹

*   **Reliable baseload power:** Provides stable 24/7 supply, unlike intermittent renewables.
*   **Low carbon emissions:** Supports net-zero and sustainability goals.
*   **Scalable and efficient:** High energy density and SMRs offer compact, reliable solutions for growing demands.
*   **Long-term cost efficiency:** High upfront costs offset by low operating expenses and long lifespan.
*   **Grid stability and security:** Enhances resilience by complementing renewables and reducing fossil fuel dependence.

## IV. Emerging opportunities: supporting renewable energy management mechanisms for data center to achieve net zero goals

*   **Renewable energy certificates:** Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) allow data centers to offset carbon emissions by purchasing credits equal to 1 MWh of renewable power.
*   **Exchange traded power:** Exchange-traded power offers data centers flexible, cost-efficient energy procurement. By using power exchanges and PPAs, they can access lower-cost, renewable energy.
*   **Intra and interstate policies:** India's intra- and inter-state power policies significantly impact data center energy strategies. Intra-state policies, like Uttar Pradesh's 2021 incentives, promote renewable use within states. Inter-state policies enable open access to cheaper or greener power from neighboring states.⁴²
*   **Nuclear, tidal and hydrogen:** These 3 energy sources are emerging as next-generation solutions to meet the data center industry's growing demand for sustainable and reliable power. Nuclear reactors like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) offer a stable, zero-carbon baseload ideal for hyperscale operations. Tidal energy, with its predictability and low environmental impact, presents a viable option for coastal data center developments. Meanwhile, green hydrogen is gaining traction as a clean, long-duration backup power source, with the potential to replace diesel and support true net-zero operations. Together, these technologies represent the future of resilient and carbon-free data center energy strategies.

## V. Strategic implications of renewable energy for data center development

*   **Energy siting decisions:** Data center operators are increasingly prioritizing locations with strong renewable energy infrastructure to ensure a reliable and green power supply for the facilities. States like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra offer diversified and large-scale RE capacities, supporting reliable green energy supply for new data center clusters.
*   **Policy alignment:** India's updated NDCs and targets of **50% non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030** and **net zero by 2070** reinforce a favorable policy environment.
