data centers to handle large-scale storage and operations. The growing IoT ecosystem is further amplifying this demand, as businesses seek decentralized data centers to reduce network congestion and enhance real-time analytics.

**Social media and gaming:** Social media and gaming platforms which are among the largest consumers of data, require highly scalable infrastructure and ultra-low latency to support millions of concurrent users, live streaming, multiplayer interactions, and rapid content delivery.

**Rise of AI:** The rise of AI and Gen AI is reshaping data center infrastructure needs. AI-driven workloads, such as machine learning and large language models (LLMs), demand GPU-optimized data centers with advanced processing power. Gen AI applications require high-density infrastructure and efficient cooling systems to manage their intense computational needs. Moreover, AI is enhancing data center operations through predictive maintenance and network optimization, boosting reliability and efficiency.

### 1.5.1 Growth catalysts for data centers

* **Hyperscalers**

Hyperscalers such as AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle are at the core of India's data center ecosystem, consuming approximately 55% of Indian data centers' IT MW capacity as of March 31, 2025, powering a wide range of digital services, from enterprise workloads and developer platforms to AI and content delivery. Their growth is driven by:

- Rising cloud adoption among enterprises
- Data localization regulations requiring storage within India
- Expansion of AI-ready and GPU-intensive workloads
- Rapid expansion of digital-native businesses demanding high-scale infrastructure.

By leveraging both self-built and colocation models, hyperscalers enable scalable, high-performance infrastructure while ensuring compliance and operational efficiency. Additionally, as demand for AI-ready and GPU-based setups increases, hyperscalers are expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of data center development in India. This surge in demand is being met by leading data center operators such as STT, CtrlS, NTT, and SISL, who provide the physical infrastructure backbone for hyperscaler deployments. Hyperscalers and enterprises are increasingly prioritizing ESG factors, especially sustainable energy use and carbon footprint, when selecting data center providers.

* **BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance)**

Enterprise end-users, such as BFSI, retail, and media, are major drivers of data center demand. Unlike hyperscalers, they operate in regulated or customer-facing sectors that require secure, scalable infrastructure. These users typically adopt colocation, private, or hybrid cloud setups to manage workloads across on-premise and third-party data centers, BFSI in particular, is one of the largest end-users. The BFSI sector relies on data centers for real-time financial transactions, fraud detection, and data security. With the surge in digital banking, mobile payments, and high-frequency trading, BFSI companies are increasingly investing in hybrid and private cloud infrastructure to ensure data privacy and compliance with evolving regulations. Data centers also enable advanced analytics, AI-driven risk assessments, and improved customer experiences through faster transaction processing and enhanced service availability. India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been a significant driver of this digital transformation, processing a record 18.3 billion‚Åµ transactions, necessitating robust data center infrastructures to handle the escalating transaction volumes and ensure seamless financial operations. In addition to traditional BFSI, the rise of other fintech players like digital lending platforms, neobanks, insurance tech and investment apps, has significantly contributed to the demand for agile, scalable data infrastructure. These companies depend on real-time data processing, AI/ML algorithms, and secure cloud-native architectures, all of which are supported by robust data centers.

* **Cloud and SaaS providers**

Cloud and SaaS companies are among the largest consumers of data centers, driving demand for multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructures. This demand is being driven by rapid digital transformation across industries, increased enterprise migration to cloud, proliferation of data-intensive applications (such as AI/ML workloads), and the need for agile, scalable IT environments to support evolving business models. The rising complexity of SaaS workloads, coupled with the need for scalability, reliability, and redundancy, is
