## 1. Part funding of capital expenditure requirements towards completion of tower B of Chennai 02 Data Center

We operate two data centers in Chennai, as of June 30, 2025. Chennai 02 Data Center is a Hyperscaler data center campus with over 25.92 MW of built IT power capacity, as of June 30, 2025. The Chennai 02 Data Center is a carrier-neutral campus with dual meet-me-rooms and interconnects with various telecom service providers and ISPs. The Chennai 02 Data Center has dense fiber deployment from various providers, which helps enable high-capacity, low latency and resilient network access across data center sites. In addition, the Chennai 02 Data Center is equipped with facilities designed to handle AI-related applications with specifications that can host workloads of up to 130 KW per rack using direct-to-chip technology.

The Chennai 02 Data Center was also the first data center in India to host an on-premise subsea data cable landing station, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. This provides transpacific fiber access with up to 2 petabytes of capacity.

Other technical facilities at the Chennai 02 Data Center include 4 diverse fiber paths and an on-side 230 kV GIS substation, which helps ensure uninterrupted, high-capacity power supply. The Tower B facility at the Chennai 02 Data Center has been awarded the Indian Green Building Council Platinum rating. Moreover, the Tower B facility at the Chennai 02 Data Center has obtained TIA-942 Rated 4 certification, which, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, is the highest level of certification that represents fully fault-tolerant infrastructure, with redundant systems for all critical components, offering proof of a progressive hierarchy of availability and system design sophistication of a data center. The Tower B facility at the Chennai 02 Data Center has also received NVIDIA-certified DGX-Ready status for AI workloads and liquid cooling, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report.

Chennai 02 Data Center comprises a shared basement structure that connects three towers, Tower A, Tower B, and Tower C. The basement construction combining all the three towers has been completed, and the core and shell of the central structure of tower B, are fully built. Construction work (including civil core and shell for super structure works) for the remaining towers, Tower A and Tower C, is yet to commence. Our Company proposes to utilise the Net Proceeds to partially fund the capital expenditure requirements for completion of tower B of Chennai 02 Data Center in order to increase the built IT power capacity by an additional 26.00 MW by Fiscal 2028.
