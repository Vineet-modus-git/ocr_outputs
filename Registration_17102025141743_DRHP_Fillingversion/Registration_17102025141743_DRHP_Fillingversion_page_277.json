By submerging servers in non-conductive fluids, this method enables higher rack densities, reduces energy consumption, and improves thermal stability—ideal for power-intensive compute zones. Additionally, monitoring advancements in cooling technologies could potentially result in lower PUE and result in considerable OpEx savings. One such cooling technology at a nascent stage is photonic (laser-based) cooling that incorporates more targeted, energy-efficient thermal management. SISL's continuous advancements and improvements in cooling technologies could strengthen its position in next-gen data center operations.⁹⁸"}, {"bbox": [295, 723, 1060, 757], "category": "Section-header", "text": "#### 2.
