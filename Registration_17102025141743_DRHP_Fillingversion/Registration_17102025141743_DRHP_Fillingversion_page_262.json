Sectors such as banking are witnessing growing momentum in data repatriation, driven by compliance and cybersecurity concerns. Regulatory bodies, such as CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team), have introduced increasingly stringent mandates requiring specific and immediate implementation, often difficult to execute within third-party cloud environments. Moreover, banks struggle with gaining complete visibility and control over data flows in public clouds, including understanding ports, protocols, and underlying technologies in use. These limitations make effective monitoring and security a challenge. At the same time, a new wave of “Neo-cloud” players is emerging. These providers differentiate themselves from traditional hyperscalers by focusing on regional deployments, sovereign cloud models, edge-first infrastructure, or industry-specific cloud services. They often offer greater pricing transparency, lower total cost of ownership, and more control over data flows, features that appeal to enterprises rethinking their cloud strategies. Many of these neo-cloud providers are now evaluating India as a strategic geography to host computation-heavy workloads, given its cost advantages, strong developer ecosystem, and improving renewable energy mix. As India's AI ecosystem continues to mature, emerging cloud providers are likely to consider establishing data center operations in the country, recognizing the strategic importance of participating in India's growth story. This mirrors the trajectory followed by hyperscalers in expanding their presence over the past few years."}, {"bbox": [309, 665, 1545, 1647], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [290, 1662, 773, 1695], "category": "Text", "text": "Source(s): Industry reports, News articles, Lattice analysis"}, {"bbox": [290, 1718, 1605, 1854], "category": "Text", "text": "Hybrid cloud inflexion point refers to a critical juncture or turning point in an organization's cloud strategy where the adoption and utilization of a hybrid cloud model fundamentally changes.
