Retailers are adopting digital tools across operations from supply chain and inventory to CRM and marketing, enhancing efficiency and engagement. As part of this shift, AI is increasingly being used to improve warehouse and inventory management, helping predict seasonal demand, manage the right mix of product sizes (SKUs), and reduce stockouts or overstocking. These applications require real-time data processing and scalable storage, further increasing reliance on data centers. An omnichannel strategy requires unified data systems to sync customer, product, and order data across platforms. The rise of dark stores, third-party brand integration, and real-time inventory sync is further increasing storage needs. Additionally, newer retail segments like food delivery are emerging as key data center demand drivers due to higher order frequencies."}, {"bbox": [292, 548, 656, 583], "category": "List-item", "text": "* Media and entertainment"}, {"bbox": [341, 610, 1604, 873], "category": "Text", "text": "The media and entertainment sector is rapidly transitioning from traditional channels to digital-first models, driven by the rise of on-demand streaming and cross-platform content delivery.
