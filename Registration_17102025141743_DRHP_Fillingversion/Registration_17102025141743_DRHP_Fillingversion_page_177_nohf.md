* Note - India has committed to achieving 50% of its energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 as part of its climate goals under the Paris Agreement. This national target directly influences energy-intensive sectors like data centers, encouraging them to transition towards renewable energy to align with the country's sustainability objectives.

## 2.1.2 Assessing India's macro environment for data center

The macro environment significantly influences the establishment and operation of data centers. Key factors include proximity to fiber optic networks, political and economic stability, talent availability, and security. This section examines these factors in context of India and offers enhanced insights into major Indian cities and states where the SISL's portfolio is concentrated: Mumbai, Delhi-Noida, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kolkata.

### 2.1.2.1 Key factors influencing data center expansion in India

**A. Proximity to fiber optic networks and global connectivity**

India's strategic location at the heart of the Indian Ocean region, booming digital economy, and evolving submarine cable landscape are converging to position the country as a major global node in fiber optic connectivity—an essential backbone for data center infrastructure and the digital economy at large. As of February 2025, Telegeography reported 570 in-service submarine cables across the globe. These cables are estimated to carry over 97% of the world's internet traffic (with the remaining 3% being serviced by satellites), cable transmission capacity is in terabits with low latency (low delay) while that of satellites is in 1,000 megabits with higher latency (higher delay). Digital transformation of global economy with associated technologies such as 5G or 6G facilitated Internet of Things (IoT) and increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum computing point to an exponential rise in data movements across the globe. India's proximity to this vast and rapidly expanding network significantly strengthens its appeal as a regional and global data hub. No nation other than India is better situated by demography and geography to be a leading data hub as it boasts one of the youngest, largest and fastest growing digital markets.²⁰

**B. India's submarine cable footprint: (current landscape)**

**International subsea cables:** India hosts 17 international subsea cables (SEACOM and MENA counted separately) terminating at 14 cable landing stations located in five coastal cities—Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi, Tuticorin, and Trivandrum. These stations are operated by leading telecom and tech players including Tata Communications, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, Global Cloud eXchange (formerly Reliance Globalcom), Sify, BSNL, and Vodafone. Mumbai alone accounts for 9 of 14 landings, reinforcing its position as a gateway to global digital networks. Subsea cables facilitate the efficient movement of data by providing high speed data, more capacity connections, to enable seamless transfer and reduce the risk of disruptions. These subsea cables terminate at the cable stations and provides seamless data transfer for the data centers in these regions. This creates an opportunity for data center infrastructure development by large scale providers in these regions.

**International bandwidth available:** The total international bandwidth available and used for India as of 2021 stood at 124 Tbps and 84 Tbps, respectively.²¹ These cables had a total capacity of 138.606 Tbps, with 111.111 Tbps activated, as of the end of 2022.²² Whereas in March 2025, Mr. Anil Kumar Lahoti, Chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) stated, “As of the end of 2024, the total lit capacity and activated capacity of India's subsea cable systems stood at 193 Tbps and 148 Tbps, respectively”, at the 1st International Subsea Cable Systems Conference. This underscores India's expanding role as a digital gateway in the region, with significant investments aimed at enhancing global connectivity and bandwidth availability. It is also indicative of the soaring demand, driven by the explosive growth in data consumption, 5G rollout, and cloud services expansion. The Indian market is fast evolving, and several new cables are coming into operation in the next few years with additional coastal cities for landings.

**C. India's connectivity demand trajectory and infrastructure growth**

India's international bandwidth demand is projected to grow 10-fold by 2028, reflecting a 38% CAGR.²³ This surge is fueled by 4 major drivers:

1. Greater investment in data centers, driven by India's market potential.
2. The rapid growth in smart phones and data usage.
