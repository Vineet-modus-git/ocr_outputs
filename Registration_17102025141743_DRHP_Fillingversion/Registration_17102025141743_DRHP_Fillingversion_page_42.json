If energy costs were to continue to rise, or if electricity supply arrangements were disrupted, our data center operations could be disrupted, and our profitability could decline. We source our electricity requirements mostly from the state electricity grid at the uniform standard prices set by the local regulators, private power purchase arrangements (“PPAs”) with renewable power companies, and our own diesel generator sets. As of June 30, 2025, we had 309.60 megawatt peak (“MWP”) of renewable power contracted under our PPAs. We believe that continued investment in renewable power will enable us to maintain our competitive pricing position over our competitors. We price the cost of power under our data center infrastructure and pass the cost on to our clients. If our competitors are able to procure renewable power at lower costs, they may have an advantage over us with respect to pricing. Our inability to offer competitive pricing may result in loss of clients and impact our business and results of operations. The alternate sources of power are also exposed to inflation, regulation and hence, any undue price increase would affect our energy cost significantly."}, {"bbox": [244, 833, 1599, 901], "category": "Text", "text": "Moreover, inadequate electricity and diesel for our generators could result in interruption or suspension of our operations.

Occasionally, the power grid in India may experience capacity or supply constraints, such as grid congestion and restrictions on transmission capacity of the grid, and therefore the transmission and dispatch of electricity could be curtailed. While we are focused on expanding the use of renewable energy to power our operations, we are still dependent on India's power grid for our operations. Power outages or disruptions, even if remediated quickly, may have a significant disruptive impact on our services and operations, including our cooling systems, which may lead to client dissatisfaction and loss of revenue. While we have not experienced power supply disruptions that had a material impact on our business operations in the three months ended June 30, 2025, or during Fiscals 2025, 2024 and 2023, we cannot assure you that we may not experience such disruptions in the future. If we do face a shortage of power supply or a power outage, we typically resort to our internal back-up power generation systems and alternative sources of power, and the running of the data centers will then depend on the availability of fuel/renewable energy or such alternative sources of power, which will generally increase the cost of our operations, thereby adversely affecting our business, revenues and cash flows."}, {"bbox": [143, 1368, 1601, 1471], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 4.
