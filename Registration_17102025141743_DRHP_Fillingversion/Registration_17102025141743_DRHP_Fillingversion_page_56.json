In addition, bringing new data center capacity online requires substantial upfront capital commitments by us and a typical construction and deployment time of between 18 and 24 months. The lengthy timelines associated with capacity creation expose us to the risk of being unable to provide our prospective clients with the levels of capacity they require. While we have generally been successful in pursuing sales and our key clients, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in pursuing sales and clients in the future. If such efforts are unsuccessful, our revenue generation might be delayed, which may in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition."}]
