accelerating the adoption of colocation and hyperscale data centers. Additionally, growing data sovereignty regulations are prompting cloud providers to invest in localized data centers to meet compliance requirements.

* **Manufacturing and automation**

The rise of Industry 4.0, driven by automation, robotics, predictive maintenance, and IoT integration, is reshaping the manufacturing landscape and creating new demand for data centers. Smart factories and digital twins require real-time data ingestion, processing, and feedback loops, all of which are supported by edge and core data center infrastructure.

As manufacturers embrace AI and machine learning for quality control, supply chain optimization, and process automation, the need for high-performance computing infrastructure is expected to grow substantially.

* **Streaming, OTT and social media**

Streaming platforms heavily depend on data centers for low-latency content delivery, real-time analytics, and AI-driven personalization. As global content consumption rises, providers are expanding their data center footprints to reduce buffering and enhance content delivery speed. The adoption of CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and distributed data centers helps cache content closer to end-users, improving performance and customer satisfaction. In India, this demand is reflected in a large and growing digital audience, with over 547 million‚Å∂ video streamers and 491 million active social media users as of calendar year 2024. Platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Netflix, JioHotstar etc., command significant user bases. These trends underscore the critical need for scalable, high-performance data centers to support growing digital consumption.

* **Government push for digital infrastructure**

The Indian government is playing a pivotal role in accelerating data center growth through robust e-governance initiatives, digital transformation in the public sector, and the rollout of smart city projects. The increasing adoption of IoT-based applications, ranging from traffic management and surveillance to public service automation, demands real-time data processing capabilities, making data centers a critical backbone of this transformation. Stricter data localization regulations are further driving investment in secure, domestic data center infrastructure to ensure data sovereignty and regulatory compliance. Notably, India achieved a nationwide rollout of 5G in October 2024, making it one of the fastest countries globally to deploy the technology. Additionally, infrastructure development programs such as BharatNet and the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) (erstwhile - Universal Service Obligation Fund) scheme are expected to not only improve the country's digital infrastructure but also fuel demand for data centers by enabling broader internet access and digital adoption. The DBN is a government initiative aimed at providing telecom and internet connectivity in rural and remote areas by funding infrastructure development through levies collected from telecom operators.
