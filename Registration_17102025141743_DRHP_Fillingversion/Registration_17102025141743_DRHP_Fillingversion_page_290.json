During Fiscal 2025, all of our Hyperscaler clients availed themselves of the connectivity stack offered by STL, in addition to our colocation offering. During Fiscal 2025, all of all our Enterprise clients used our interconnection and value-added services. Our clients, in particular Hyperscaler clients, benefit from STL's extensive experience in network services, as well as seamless subsea connectivity into inland connection and into our domestic network.

We prioritize sustainability through a combination of energy efficiency and the implementation of carbon-free and renewable energy solutions, including by entering into PPAs for renewable energy. We are focused on sustainability and the incorporation of renewable energy sources into our operations. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 58.69% of power capacity utilized at the Rabale Data Center campus (Towers 1, 2 and 3), Vashi Data Center and Airoli Data Center during the last 12 months was generated from renewable energy sources, which is notably high compared to the broader industry landscape, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. As Hyperscalers and Enterprises are increasingly prioritizing environmental, social and governance factors, especially sustainable energy use and carbon footprint when selecting data center providers, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, we are well-positioned to be the partner of choice to such clients as they continue to expand their operations in India. Our Promoter, STL, was one of the earliest adopters of renewable power sources in the data center industry in India, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, having incorporated renewable energy sources into its operations since 2013. We also augment our supply of grid power with power from renewable energy to power our data centers, including to facilitate data center solutions for our Hyperscaler clients. Over the period from 2023 to 2025, we have incorporated 54.47% renewable energy in our power mix at our largest campuses at the Rabale Data Center (Towers 1, 2 and 3), in addition to smaller renewable energy usage at the Airoli Data Center, the Vashi Data Center and the Bengaluru Data Center. As of June 30, 2025, we had incorporated 62.59% renewable energy in our power mix at the Rabale Data Center (Towers 1, 2 and 3)."}, {"bbox": [194, 1608, 1602, 1737], "category": "Text", "text": "Our investments in renewable energy sources include equity investments in renewable energy, in line with the requirements of the Electricity Act, 2003.
