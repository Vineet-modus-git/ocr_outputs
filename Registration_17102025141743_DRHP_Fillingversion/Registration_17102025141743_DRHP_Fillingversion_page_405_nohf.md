In assessing the realizability of the deferred income tax assets, management considers whether some portion or all of deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which deferred tax assets are deductible, management recognizes deferred tax assets on deductible temporary differences to the extent of deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.
