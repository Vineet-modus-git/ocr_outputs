### 2.1.2.4 Security considerations for Indian data centers

As India cements its position as a digital hub with increasing investments in data infrastructure, the security of data centers emerges as a cornerstone of national digital resilience. With data now widely regarded as a strategic asset, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of stored and processed data has become non-negotiable. Security threats to Indian data centers are multi-faceted ranging from cyberattacks and physical intrusions to broader geopolitical tensions and socio-political disturbances.

**Key threat categories:**²⁶ Indian data centers face a similar threat landscape to global peers, with some localized nuances:

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Threat category</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Cyberattacks</td><td>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), malware, phishing, and SQL injections target both enterprises and government-run data centers.</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Physical security risks</td><td>With the rapid growth of colocation facilities in key urban hubs such as Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Pune and Kolkata, ensuring robust physical access control has become critical. Stringent measures are required to safeguard infrastructure, protect customer data, and maintain compliance with industry security standards.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Insider threats</td><td>This remains a top concern, especially with high staff turnover or lack of strict access protocols.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Environmental hazards</td><td>Earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes damage infrastructure, disrupt power supply, and lead to data loss. Power outages and equipment failure, including unexpected power losses or failures in cooling systems are other environmental hazards that cause hardware damage and data loss.</td></tr></tbody></table>
