Some measures that can be incorporated to reduce latency through data center infrastructure are outlined below:"}, {"bbox": [292, 254, 1606, 1006], "category": "List-item", "text": "*   **Proximity to data sources:** Edge data centers are located closer to the point of data generation, such as within urban centers, industrial hubs, or near telecommunications infrastructure. By minimizing the physical distance that data must travel, these facilities significantly reduce round-trip time, thereby enhancing response speed.\n*   **Localized data processing:** Unlike traditional centralized data centers, edge facilities are capable of processing and storing data locally. This decentralization eliminates the need to transmit all data to a core data center for computation, resulting in reduced transmission delays and enabling near real-time data analysis and decision-making.\n*   **Alleviation of network bottlenecks:** High volumes of data transmitted over long distances can congest core network infrastructure, impacting performance. Edge data centers alleviate this challenge by handling a substantial portion of the data locally, reducing the strain on the network and lowering latency for end-users and business-critical applications.\n*   **Leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs):** Implementing CDNs enable organizations to deliver content from servers located closer to end-users, effectively reducing data travel distance and minimizing latency. By distributing cached content across a network of geographically dispersed nodes, CDNs enhance delivery speed and reliability, particularly for static assets and media streaming, where low latency is critical to maintaining a high-quality user experience.\n*   **Regular hardware upgrades:** Keeping hardware up to date with the latest high-performance components ensures optimal data processing and storage speeds, contributing to reduced latency. Upgrades such as high-core, high-frequency CPUs enable faster computation and more efficient handling of workloads compared to legacy systems."}, {"bbox": [193, 1031, 999, 1068], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 4.2.2 Use cases and usage drivers for various customer segments"}, {"bbox": [292, 1091, 1606, 1194], "category": "Text", "text": "Data centers are used by hyperscalers, BFSI, technology players (including by governments for purposes like data management and storage), telecom, retail and e-commerce, media and entertainment industry (for example, by OTT players) and others."}, {"bbox": [292, 1215, 1606, 1444], "category": "Text", "text": "Data centers, by the aforementioned players, are utilized for a wide range of critical functions, including data storage, processing, and management.
