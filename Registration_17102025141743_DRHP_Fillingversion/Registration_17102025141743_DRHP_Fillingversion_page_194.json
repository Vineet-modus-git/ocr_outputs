Developing an advanced data center is a highly complex undertaking that requires multi-functional expertise and substantial up-front capital expenditure. The cost dynamics vary significantly across major data centers hubs such as Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata affecting the financial feasibility and expansion strategies of new and existing data centers. Beyond proximity to demand hubs and connectivity infrastructure, several location-specific factors such as seismic zone classification, flood risk, and climatic conditions directly influence the size or permissible capacity, design specifications and scalability of a data center."}, {"bbox": [244, 1221, 1555, 1352], "category": "Text", "text": "India is rapidly positioning itself as a key data centers hub in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.
