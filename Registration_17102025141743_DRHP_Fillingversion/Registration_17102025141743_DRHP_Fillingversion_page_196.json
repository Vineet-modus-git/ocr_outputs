India's construction cost per megawatt remains among the most cost-effective, making it an attractive destination for hyperscale and colocation data centers. In 2024, India recorded one of the highest increases in data center construction costs in APAC, with a 5% rise due to escalating land prices, higher demand for power infrastructure, and the development of AI-ready workload/high-specification facilities. This increase reflects the significant build activity currently underway across major data centers hubs in India. Despite the rise, India remains more affordable than mature markets such as Japan and Australia, benefiting from abundant land availability, a deep and increasingly experienced pool of contractors, and relatively lower entry costs, making it an ever more investable market."}, {"bbox": [244, 573, 1559, 831], "category": "Text", "text": "India's favorable cost environment for data center construction is highlighted in the Turner and Townsend Data centre cost index (DCCI) 2024, which benchmarks the construction costs across 50 major global markets. Mumbai's data center cost index of 0.60 is one of the lowest. The only major market with a lower cost index is Shanghai (0.55). In contrast Tokyo and Singapore have one of the highest data center cost indexes of 1.3 and 1.25, respectively. London with a DCCI of 1.0 and North Virginia, the largest data center market in the world and with a DCCI of 0.95 serve as useful reference point and reinforce the cost advantages of constructing a data center in Mumbai and in India. This positions India with a clear competitive edge, offering construction costs significantly lower than those in many developed markets.⁴⁷"}, {"bbox": [144, 855, 1121, 892], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 2.1.5.4 Regional land and site acquisition cost across mid specification build type"}, {"bbox": [244, 915, 1559, 983], "category": "Text", "text": "This section outlines regional variations in land and site acquisition costs for data centers, focusing on high-rise, mid specification builds."}, {"bbox": [244, 1007, 1487, 1043], "category": "Text", "text": "The below table depicts the land and site acquisition cost for a five-acre land parcel with 50MW built capacity."}, {"bbox": [244, 1063, 1553, 1705], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><td>Market Cluster</td><td>Land and Site Acquisition Cost INR Millions</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bengaluru Peripheral South</td><td>INR 2,630</td></tr><tr><td>Chennai - Ambattur</td><td>INR 1,450</td></tr><tr><td>Gurugram</td><td>INR 4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Noida</td><td>INR 1,180</td></tr><tr><td>South Hyderabad</td><td>INR 450</td></tr><tr><td>West Hyderabad</td><td>INR 3,380</td></tr><tr><td>Panvel</td><td>INR 417</td></tr><tr><td>Powai</td><td>INR 5,330</td></tr><tr><td>Thane Belapur Road</td><td>INR 3,440</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [244, 1705, 994, 1731], "category": "Text", "text": "*Note: Applied Local FX Rate – USD1 = INR 83.67 as of end of calendar year 2024*"}, {"bbox": [244, 1731, 998, 1758], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: C&W Research | Asia Pacific - Data Centers Construction Cost Guide 2025"}, {"bbox": [244, 1783, 1079, 1818], "category": "Text", "text": "The below table depicts the land and site acquisition cost in INR Per SQM"}, {"bbox": [244, 1838, 1553, 2100], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><thead><tr><td>Cluster land / site purchase cost unit</td><td>City</td><td>Cost for mid specification (INR/SQM)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Powai</td><td>Mumbai</td><td>INR 2,63,640</td></tr><tr><td>Thane Belapur Road</td><td>Mumbai</td><td>INR 1,70,270</td></tr><tr><td>Panvel</td><td>Mumbai</td><td>INR 20,580</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [144, 2194, 448, 2214], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "47 Turner & Townsend Data Centre Cost Index 2024"}]
