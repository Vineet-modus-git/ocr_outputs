### Subsequent measurement:

#### (i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost:

Financial assets held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cashflows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is recognised as finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

The Company while applying above criteria has classified the following financial assets at amortised cost

a) Trade receivable

b) Other financial assets.

#### (ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI):

Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are subsequently measured at FVTOCI. Fair value movements in financial assets at FVTOCI are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Equity instruments held for trading are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). For other equity instruments the company classifies the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. Fair value changes on equity investments at FVTOCI, excluding dividends, are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI).

#### (iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL):

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss if it does not meet the criteria for classification as measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. All fair value changes are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

### Derecognition of financial assets:

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the financial asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) shall be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

### Impairment of financial assets:

Trade receivables, contract assets, lease receivables under Ind AS 109, investments in debt instruments that are carried at amortised cost, investments in debt instruments that are carried at FVTOCI are tested for impairment based on the expected credit losses for the respective financial asset.

#### (i) Trade receivables

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date. The expected credit losses over lifetime of the asset are estimated by adopting the simplified approach using a provision matrix which is based on historical loss rates reflecting current condition and forecasts of future economic conditions. In this approach assets are grouped on the basis of similar credit characteristics such as industry, customer segment, past due status and other factors which are relevant to estimate the expected cash loss from these assets.

#### (ii) Other financial assets

Other financial assets are tested for impairment based on significant change in credit risk since initial recognition and impairment is measured based on probability of default over the lifetime when there is significant increase in credit risk.

### b. Financial liabilities

#### Initial recognition and measurement:

Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and any transaction cost that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial liabilities except financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value.
