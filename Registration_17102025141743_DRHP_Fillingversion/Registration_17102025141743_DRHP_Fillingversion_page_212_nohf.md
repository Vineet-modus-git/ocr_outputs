### 2.2.4 Infrastructure requisites

#### 2.2.4.1 IT infrastructure and hardware used

Racks are standardized housing units that organize and support servers and IT equipment within data centers. Data center capacity and sales are typically measured in "powered racks" - standardized units that provide structured mounting, power distribution, and cooling for multiple servers and networking equipment. Data centers require robust server and processor infrastructures to efficiently handle diverse workloads, including AI and machine learning tasks. Following are the types of servers and processors:

*   **Servers:** Servers are the backbone of data centers, handling data processing, storage, and management. Available as tower, rack, or blade types, they are tailored for various workloads and scalability needs. By powering applications, cloud computing, and enterprise operations, high-performance servers ensure uptime, security, and reliability in modern IT infrastructure.

*   **Processors:** Data centers utilize a variety of processors to meet diverse computational demands. The primary categories include:
    -   **Central Processing Units (CPUs):** CPUs serve as the backbone of data centers, efficiently managing general-purpose tasks such as database processing, web hosting, and application execution
    -   **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs):** GPUs excel at parallel processing, making them ideal for tasks like AI training, AI inference, and scientific simulations
    -   **Data Processing Units (DPUs):** DPUs are specialized processors that handle data processing tasks, such as network and security functions, and offload tasks from CPUs and GPUs
    -   **Specialized accelerators:** DPUs enhance efficiency in managing data-centric workloads within data centers

#### 2.2.4.2 Cybersecurity infrastructure

Ensuring compliance strengthens data center security by mitigating cyber risks and protecting against breaches. It also enhances operational efficiency and reliability, building a resilient infrastructure fit for the digital age.

Some important data center compliance standards are:

*   **ISO 27001:** ISO 27001 is a gold standard for information security management systems. It involves implementing comprehensive security controls, policies, and procedures and signifies a commitment to robust data security practices, instilling confidence in clients.
*   **SSAE 16 and ISAE 3402:** These standards focus on controls and processes within a data center or service organization. SSAE 16 (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16) and ISAE 3402 (International Standard on Assurance Engagements No. 3402) provide transparency in data center operational integrity.
