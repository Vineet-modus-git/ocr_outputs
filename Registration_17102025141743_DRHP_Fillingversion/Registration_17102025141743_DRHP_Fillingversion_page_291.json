As our data centers mature, improved utilization and a lower PUE factor enhance operational efficiency and drive higher ROCE, especially as these long-life assets continue to generate returns beyond their depreciable life. Given that POD-based assets represent roughly 75–80% of total capital expenditure and have a depreciable life of 8 years, ROCE generally stabilizes in the 15–20% range during this period.
