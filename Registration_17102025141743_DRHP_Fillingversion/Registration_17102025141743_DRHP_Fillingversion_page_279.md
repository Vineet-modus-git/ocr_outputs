As India's digital economy fuels rapidly growing demand, the country's operational readiness ensures efficient execution of data center development. The execution and operation of data centers are influenced by both technical requirements and macro-environmental factors such as regulation, power, real estate, and climate. India offers a highly conducive environment for data center growth, supported by favorable policies, data localization guidelines, rising digital consumption, and a young and connected population. Strong fundamentals include reliable power availability, increasing renewable integration, expanding network connectivity, and state-level incentives like land facilitation, tax benefits, and power subsidies. Competitive construction costs and robust demand make India an attractive market for global and domestic operators. The overall Indian ecosystem strongly supports sustainable data center expansion.

But the data center business model is defined by high upfront capital investment followed by stable, long-term revenue, resulting in Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) that improve as facilities reach maturity. AI is fundamentally reshaping data center technology, driving demand for high-density power and cooling solutions to support powerful GPUs and specialized hardware. Simultaneously, AI is being used to optimize data center operations, significantly enhancing efficiency in energy management, predictive maintenance, and workload management.

India's data center demand is projected to experience significant growth, increasing from 1.3 GW in Fiscal 2025 to 4.7-5.7 GW by Fiscal 2030, a CAGR of 30.1-35.1%. A major catalyst for this growth is AI, with AI-related workloads expected to increase from less than 1% of data center workloads in Fiscal 2025 to 15-20% by Fiscal 2030. This demand is further amplified by strong data localization laws, a significant shift from traditional enterprise server rooms to colocation facilities, and India's emergence as an attractive global hub for data center investment due to cost efficiencies and a supportive policy environment.

All of the aforementioned factors also influence the data center supply dynamics. In India, the data center supply has grown at a rate of 25.47% between 2021 and 2025 and is expected to continue its steady trajectory to surpass 4.1 GW of installed capacity by calendar year 2030.

Notable data center supply hubs of Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Pune and Kolkata remain central to this momentum, attracting sustained activity from operators, investors, and real estate developers. As new entrants, joint ventures, and international players expand into the market, competition is intensifying, with stakeholders positioning themselves to capitalize on India's high-growth potential and superior return prospects. The competitive landscape features prominent players such as SISL, NTT Limited, Nxtra Data (Airtel), CtrlS Datacenters, ST Telemedia Global Data Centers, Webwerks, Equinix, Digital Realty, Global Switch, Iron Mountain and several others who are all actively expanding their footprint in India.

As the third largest player in India's data center sector, and with the added advantage of being a home-grown company in a rapidly expanding market, SISL is well positioned in the Indian data center landscape.
