### Market risk:

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk (currency risk), interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

### Currency risk:

The Company's exposure in USD, Euro and other foreign currency denominated transactions gives rise to Exchange rate fluctuation risk. Company's policy in this regard incorporates:

* Forecasting inflows and outflows denominated in US$ for a twelve-month period

* Estimating the net-exposure in foreign currency, in terms of timing and amount.

* Determining the extent to which exposure should be protected through one or more risk-mitigating instruments to maintain the permissible limits of uncovered exposures.

* Carrying out a variance analysis between estimate and actual on an ongoing basis, and taking stop-loss action when the adverse movements breaches the 5% barrier of deviation, subject to review by Board of Directors.
