participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal market or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial information are categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. The fair value hierarchy is described below:

Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial information at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of fair value hierarchy.

Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

### (i) Investments in equity and debt securities

The fair value is determined by reference to their quoted price at the reporting date. In the absence of quoted price, the fair value of the financial asset is measured using valuation techniques.

### (ii) Trade and other receivables

The fair value of trade and other receivables expected to be realised beyond twelve months, excluding construction contracts in progress, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. However in respect of such financial instruments, fair value generally approximates the carrying amount due to the short term nature of such assets. This fair value is determined for disclosure purposes or when acquired in a business combination.

### (iii) Derivatives

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their quoted price, if available. If a quoted price is not available, the fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract. Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Company and the counter party when appropriate. The fair value of the cross currency swaps (principal only swaps) and interest rate swaps is determined based on the discounting of the future cash flows at the market rates existing on the reporting date.

### (iv) Non derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
