One of the most suitable markets for edge data centers alongside AI application, is OTT platforms, where a single streaming application demands substantial storage capacity. When edge data centers are strategically deployed across multiple cities and connected via the cloud, they offer high-speed performance, reliable output, and reduced risk of failure. BFSI is also expected to benefit from edge data centers, as they offer lower risk of disruption in services, due to their decentralized nature. With the significant rise in real-time content consumption through social media, video streaming, and gaming platforms, along with the proliferation of IoT devices across industries, the demand for edge computing is expected to witness a significant surge."}, {"bbox": [291, 563, 1654, 1878], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [293, 1884, 831, 1915], "category": "Text", "text": "Source(s): GSMA report, Industry reports, 1Lattice analysis"}, {"bbox": [194, 1940, 1041, 1974], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Measures to reduce latency in data center infrastructure and networks"}, {"bbox": [194, 2000, 1604, 2067], "category": "Text", "text": "Network speed is critical for modern businesses, powering everything from video conferencing to cloud access and global operations.
