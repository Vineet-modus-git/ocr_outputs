Digital transformation of the global economy with associated technologies such as 5G- or 6G-facilitated Internet-of-things (“IoT”) and increasing use of AI and quantum computing point to an exponential rise in data movements across the globe, and India’s proximity to this vast and rapidly expanding network significantly strengthens its appeal as a regional and global data hub, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. Monthly mobile data usage in India is expected to increase significantly from current levels of approximately 21 gigabytes (“GB”) per user per month to more than 60 GB per user per month by Fiscal 2030, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. This is expected to increase digital workloads, both in terms of per capita usage, as well as volume, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. In addition, data protection laws, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, which favor and mandate data localization and storage of key data within India are expected to drive data center demand by requiring information to be stored within India, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. In particular, due to local ecosystem support for AI in India, AI-driven workloads are expected to increase significantly and become a major contributor to data center demand, with between 0.7 gigawatt (“GW”) and 1.1 GW of additional capacity expected to be required by Fiscal 2030 to cater to AI-related workloads in India, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. As a home-grown and one of the leading Indian data center companies, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, we are able to combine our data center capabilities with our track record of operating in the industry in India, which we believe positions us to benefit from the anticipated increase in demand. This includes demand for AI-ready infrastructure, designed to support the performance and scale requirements of AI applications, as well as Edge data centers. AI workloads, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, especially those involving deep learning, demand significantly higher power densities. In addition, to manage the substantial heat generated, data centers are adopting advanced cooling solutions—liquid cooling systems, such as direct-to-chip and immersion cooling, are becoming essential to maintain optimal operating temperatures, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. Further, as demand for low latency services grows, networks that can deliver faster response times are becoming increasingly important, and Edge data centers, located in close proximity to end-users and enterprise hubs, play a key role in this shift, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. By processing data near the source, they reduce latency, enabling quicker service delivery and improved reliability across connected devices, systems and users, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report."}, {"bbox": [192, 1207, 1603, 1433], "category": "Text", "text": "As the data center industry is a power-intensive industry, we are committed to the sustainable use of power in our operations.
