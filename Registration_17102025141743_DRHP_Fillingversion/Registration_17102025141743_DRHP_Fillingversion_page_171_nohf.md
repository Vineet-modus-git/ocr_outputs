**Characteristics of edge data centers:**

* **Compact and localized:** Smaller than centralized data centers, designed to serve specific geographic areas efficiently.
* **Close to end-users:** Placed near cell towers, industrial sites, or urban areas to reduce latency and improve response times.
* **Modular and scalable:** Built with a flexible design, allowing easy expansion or downsizing based on demand.
* **Energy efficient:** Uses advanced cooling and power systems to reduce energy consumption, costs, and environmental impact.
* **High-performance hardware:** Equipped with GPUs and FPGAs for real-time data processing, AI, and IoT applications.

With the exponential rise in real-time content consumption through social media, video streaming, and gaming platforms, along with the proliferation of IoT devices across industries, the demand for edge computing has seen a significant surge. Indian data center demand is expected to grow from 1.3 GW in Fiscal 2025 to 4.7 – 5.7 GW in Fiscal 2030; edge data centers share is expected to rise from 5-8% in Fiscal 2025 to 20-25% by Fiscal 2030. These trends necessitate ultra-low latency and localized data processing, making edge data centers increasingly vital for ensuring seamless user experiences and timely decision-making. As data generation at the edge continues to grow, edge data centers are becoming integral to supporting emerging applications that require immediate computing power close to the source.

Moreover, with increasing scale, edge data centers have the potential to evolve into colocation data centers, offering shared infrastructure and services for multiple tenants while maintaining proximity to end-users. edge data centers are expected to move from being peripheral assets to becoming a vital, independent part of the digital infrastructure landscape. hyperscalers will continue to lead in software and services, but the physical infrastructure layer is expected to grow into a strong standalone market. The dominant model is expected to be a hybrid, with hyperscaler services running on infrastructure operated by specialized providers, enabling smooth collaboration and workload distribution between core and edge locations.

## 1.7 Industry's tailwinds and headwinds

**Tailwinds: Generative AI, cloud adoption and 5G rollout are driving rapid evolution and investment in data center infrastructure**

The advent of Generative AI is driving demand for high-performance, scalable data center infrastructure. Alongside this, cloud migrations offer flexible and cost-effective IT solutions, while 5G rollout enables faster, low-latency data transfer. The growth of SaaS, IoT, and connected mobility is pushing data centers toward distributed and edge models for real-time processing. Hyperscaler expansions are meeting surging digital needs, and government initiatives continue to incentivize infrastructure development. Additionally, Google and Meta are planning to set up CLS (Cable Landing Station – a facility where undersea fiber optic cables land and connect to terrestrial networks) in India, which is further expected to boost connectivity, reduce latency and drive data center demand. Supportive data policies, like India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), and increasing financialization through REITs and private
