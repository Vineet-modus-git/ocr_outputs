### OUTSTANDING LITIGATION AND MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Except as disclosed in this section, there are no outstanding (i) criminal proceedings (including matters which are at FIR stage even if no cognizance has been taken by any court) involving Company, our Promoters and Directors (together the "Relevant Parties"), Key Managerial Personnel and members of our Senior Management; (ii) actions (including all outstanding penalties, show cause notices and other notices or orders) by regulatory authorities and statutory authorities (including any judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative authorities or enforcement authorities) involving the Relevant Parties, Key Managerial Personnel and members of our Senior Management; (iii) disciplinary actions including any penalty imposed by SEBI or stock exchanges against the Promoters in the last five financial years including outstanding actions; (iv) claims related to direct and indirect tax matters involving the Relevant Parties; and (v) other pending litigation (including civil or arbitration proceedings) as per the policy of materiality adopted by our Board in accordance with SEBI ICDR Regulations. Further, except as disclosed in this section, there are no outstanding litigations involving our Group Companies that may have a material impact on the Company.

It is clarified that, for the purposes of (ii) above, notices issued by statutory or regulatory authorities received by the Relevant Parties, Key Managerial Personnel or the members of our Senior Management which are in the nature of information request are not disclosed. For the purposes of (iv) above, show cause notices, demand notices and any claims received in writing by the Relevant Parties are considered and requests for information or clarifications, if any, received without any claim amount are not considered.

Further, for the above purposes, pre-litigation notices received by the Relevant Parties, Key Managerial Personnel and the members of our Senior Management (excluding actions as covered under (ii) above), have not been considered as litigation until such time that any of the Relevant Parties are impleaded as a defendant in the litigation proceedings before any judicial forum or arbitral forum.

For the purpose of identification of material litigation in (v) above, our Board pursuant to the Board resolution dated October 14, 2025, has considered and adopted the following policy on materiality with regard to outstanding litigation to be disclosed by our Company in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus:

Further, all outstanding litigation would be considered 'material' if: (i) aggregate monetary amount of claim/dispute amount/liability involved whether by or against the Relevant Parties in any such pending litigation is in excess of the lower of the following thresholds (a) 2% of the net worth of the Company as per the last audited consolidated financial statements, except in case the arithmetic value of the net worth is negative or, (b) ₹ 2% of turnover of the Company as per the last audited consolidated financial statements or, (c) 5% of the average of absolute value of profit or loss after tax of the Company as per the last three audited consolidated financial statements ("Materiality Threshold"); (ii) litigation where the decision in one case is likely to affect the decision in similar cases, even though the amount involved in an individual litigation may not exceed the Materiality Threshold or (iii) any outstanding civil litigation/ arbitration proceedings involving the Relevant Parties wherein the monetary liability is not quantifiable, or does not exceed the Materiality Threshold, but the outcome of such litigation have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, performance, prospects, financial position or reputation of our Company. Accordingly, 5% of the average of absolute value of profit or loss after tax of the Company as per the last three audited consolidated financial statements, based on the Restated Consolidated Financial Information of the preceding three financial years disclosed in this DRHP, i.e., ₹ 52.72 million has been considered as the Materiality Threshold.

We have disclosed outstanding claims related to direct and indirect tax matters involving the Relevant Parties in a consolidated manner, giving the number of cases and total amount.

Except as stated in this section, there are no material outstanding dues to creditors of our Company. For this purpose, our Board has pursuant to the Board resolution dated October 14, 2025, considered and adopted a policy of materiality for identification of material outstanding dues to creditors. In terms of this materiality policy, dues owed by the Company to any creditor of the Company having a monetary value which exceeds 5% of the total trade payables of the Company, as on the end of the latest financial period included in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information shall be considered as 'material'. Accordingly, as on June 30, 2025, any outstanding dues exceeding ₹ 71.32 million have been considered as material outstanding dues for the purposes of disclosure in this section. For outstanding dues to any micro, small or medium enterprise ("MSME"), the disclosure shall be based on information available with our Company regarding the status of the creditor as defined under Section 2 of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 as amended, read with the rules and notification thereunder.
