mechanisms (e.g., DG sets, UPS, and dual power feeds). It must also meet stringent security, redundancy, and uptime standards.

Operationally, data centers require 24/7 power, monitoring, skilled facility and IT staff, energy optimization strategies (like hot/cold aisle containment), strict SLAs, and compliance with global standards. Seamless integration between physical infrastructure and digital controls is also key to ensuring reliability, efficiency and scalability.

## 2.1 Execution and operational aspects

The execution and operation of data centers is shaped not only by internal technical requirements but also by broader macro-environmental factors such as regulatory frameworks, power infrastructure, real estate availability and climate conditions. These external dynamics influence site selection, construction timelines, and long-term operational sustainability. In terms of operational aspects, cooling and power are tightly interlinked, with efficiency gains hinging on the alignment of thermal management strategies and energy consumption. From a construction standpoint, successful execution requires meticulous coordination across civil, electrical, and mechanical works ensuring scalable design, rapid deployment and compliance with safety and industry standards. This section delves into all operational and construction aspects of setting up a data center.

### 2.1.1 Suitability assessment for data centers

A suitability assessment helps in successful implementation of data centers, as it underpins operational efficiency, safety, scalability, and overall cost-effectiveness. Choosing a location with minimal exposure to natural hazards, consistent power supply, robust fiber connectivity and sufficient water availability is essential to ensure seamless operations and effective cooling.

*It is important to note that the parameters provided are directional and indicative in nature and are not to be completely interpreted as recommendations for establishing data centers.*
