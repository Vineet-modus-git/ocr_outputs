## Notes forming part of the Restated Consolidated financial information

(All amounts are in Indian Rupees millions except share data and as stated)

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

### As a lessor

Leases for which the company is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

## 8. Contract liability

Contract Liability (Unearned income) represents unserved portion of billed contracts. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods or services to the customer).

## 9. Impairment of non financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are

allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit or group of units on a pro rata basis.

### Reversal of impairment loss

Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized directly in other comprehensive income and presented within equity.

## 10. Employee benefits

Employee benefits are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Company, as detailed below:

### (a) Defined contribution plan (Provident fund)

Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The Company makes specified monthly contribution towards Government administered provident fund scheme. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit and loss in the periods during which the related services are rendered by employees.

### (b) Defined benefit plans (Gratuity)

In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the Company provides for a lump sum payment to eligible employees, at retirement or termination of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the Company. The gratuity fund is managed by the HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited. The company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting any unrecognized past service cost and the fair value of any plan assets.
