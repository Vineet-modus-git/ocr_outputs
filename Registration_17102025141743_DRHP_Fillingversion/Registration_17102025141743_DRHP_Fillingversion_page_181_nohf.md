### 2.1.2.5 Best practices for data centers security (India Context)²⁷

To safeguard critical infrastructure and ensure seamless operations, Indian data centers must adopt robust security strategies that address local risks, compliance needs, and operational realities.

* **Conduct regular security audits:** Engage third-party experts or the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) empaneled auditors to assess vulnerabilities and align with evolving cyber threat landscapes.
* **Enforce strict access controls:** Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), biometric verification (Aadhaar integration where applicable), and role-based access to limit personnel entry.
* **Strengthen physical security:** Deploy perimeter fencing, 24/7 security guards, CCTV surveillance, and tamper-proof locks, especially critical in remote or Tier-2/3 city locations.
* **Harden network infrastructure:** Implement firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and VPNs. Regularly patch systems and segment networks to reduce attack surfaces.
* **Encrypt and back up critical data:** Apply Advanced Encryption Standard AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit. Ensure frequent, automated backups, preferably stored off-site or on secure cloud platforms.
* **Train workforce regularly:** Conduct cybersecurity awareness workshops to tackle phishing, social engineering, and insider threats, which are common in low digital literacy environments.
* **Develop an incident response plan:** Have a localized, actionable plan mapped to CERT-In protocols, ensuring quick containment, forensic readiness, and service restoration.
* **Monitor in real-time:** Use security software for continuous monitoring and have a system for rapid threat response.
* **Ensure regulatory compliance:** Stay aligned with ISO 27001, MeitY guidelines, RBI IT frameworks (for BFSI), and data protection laws such as the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA 2023).
* **Optimize for environmental resilience:** Equip facilities with dual power supply, UPS systems, and efficient HVAC. Factoring in climate risks, such as floods, heatwaves, earthquakes, especially in high-risk zones.

### 2.1.2.6 Talent availability and human resources in India²⁸

**Evolving talent landscape for data centers-** In data centers, major talent required is in Construction, Operations and Maintenance, Safety and Security, Admin/HR etc. In India there is plenty of experienced and re-skillable talent in all these categories. As per the Economic Times, within the construction industry over 14 million skilled employees are employed. India has established itself as a major technology hub, offering a robust pool of experienced talent and deep technical expertise.

India's emergence as a global digital powerhouse is increasingly being driven by its deep pool of technology talent. With the exponential growth in AI, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and data science requirements, the data center industry, traditionally focused on physical infrastructure, is now evolving towards a highly digital, AI-ready operational model. The availability of relevant talents in AI is critical as data centers are increasingly integrating AI-based predictive maintenance, energy management, security systems, and workload optimizations. According to the India Skills Report 2025, over 0.41 million AI-ready professionals were available in India as of 2023, and this number
