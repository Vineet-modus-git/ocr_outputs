## II. Power supply during 2024 – 2025 in India

Despite a strong installed base, India faces a peak deficit of 4.3% (10.915 GW) even as it maintains an energy surplus of 2.4% (42.159 BU) during Fiscal 2025.³⁵ This indicates that while annual generation meets total energy demand, the system continues to experience peak hour strain, highlighting the need for capacity flexibility, efficient dispatch mechanisms, and demand-side optimization. This disparity underscores the challenge of ensuring grid reliability and infrastructure adequacy during high-load periods despite an overall positive energy balance. In terms of upcoming capacity, a total of 19,680 MW is slated for addition during Fiscal 2025.

### 2.1.4.2 Grid infrastructure and transmission availability

A data center's ability to access robust, high-capacity, and redundant power transmission infrastructure is fundamental to uptime and scalability. India's major metros benefit from a maturing transmission backbone, yet location-specific grid access and substation proximity remain critical differentiators.

India's electric power system transmits energy in bulk from generation sites to substations via high-voltage transmission lines, and then to end-users through lower-voltage distribution lines. Substations with transformers manage voltage shifts—stepping up for transmission and stepping down for distribution. India operates a Unified National Grid, mandating all operators to connect to it. This centralized system ensures reliable cross-state power flow and supports energy balancing, which is crucial for data centers. However, regional variations in grid strength and capacity affect data center siting decisions, making local infrastructure quality a key factor in planning.

**Transformer infrastructure analysis**

Transformer infrastructure directly supports voltage step-up/step-down processes essential for maintaining grid reliability and delivering power at usable voltages. India's power sufficiency is supported by a robust transformer ecosystem across key states, ensuring reliable distribution and grid stability. An analysis on the distribution of step up, step down and distribution transformers with their capacity across relevant states indicates the following states to be showing strong trends:

* **Karnataka** leads in distribution transformer count and capacity, indicating strong localized power reliability for urban and peri-urban zones.
* **Maharashtra** holds a balanced transformer ecosystem at all levels, complementing its extensive transmission grid.
* **Telangana's** relatively higher count of step-down transformers suggests a design optimized for secondary grid stability—advantageous for data-intensive sectors.
* **Tamil Nadu** maintains a well-established distribution transformer network, supporting reliable power supply across urban, rural, and industrial areas.
* **Delhi NCR** exhibits a high density of distribution and step-down transformers, particularly in Delhi and adjoining urban centers, ensuring robust last-mile connectivity and minimal voltage fluctuation—crucial for commercial and government infrastructure.
