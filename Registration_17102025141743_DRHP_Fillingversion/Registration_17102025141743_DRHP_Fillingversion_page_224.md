Mumbai leads India's Colocation data center market with 582 MW of built capacity and over 1 GW of development pipeline. From 2020 to 2024, the city recorded a 34% CAGR and added an average of 89 MW annually, making it one of APAC's fastest-growing markets. Future annual average supply is projected to be more than twice the historical average annual supply added (between 2020 – 2024), driven by rising demand from data localization by BFSI, cloud, e-commerce, and AI. Despite rapid supply addition, Mumbai maintains a high occupancy, with a vacancy of only 7% as of March 31, 2025, which is the lowest in the country. This balanced growth cements its position as a strategic hub for colocation and hyperscale investments in India as well as Asia.

As of 2025, Chennai has solidified its position as a pivotal hub in India's data center landscape, driven by strategic investments, robust connectivity, and supportive governmental policies. Global operators as well as domestic colocation providers have expanded their presence in Chennai, including SISL. Chennai is fast emerging as a strategic data center destination, backed by its coastal advantage, robust power availability and presence of subsea cable landing stations.

The city's connectivity is further enhanced by the integration of major submarine cable systems, including the recently activated SEA-ME-WE-6 (Southeast Asia – Middle East – Western Europe 6), which connects India to Southeast Asia and Europe.⁵² This infrastructure ensures low-latency, high-bandwidth international data exchange, crucial for global enterprises and cloud service providers.
