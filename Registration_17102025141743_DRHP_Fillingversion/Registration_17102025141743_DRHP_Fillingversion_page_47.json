The Data Protection Act introduced stricter data protection norms for an entity such as ours and may impact our processes. The Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has also recently released the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025 (\"Draft DPDP Rules\") for public consultation. The Draft DPDP Rules, regulate the processing of personal data in India, ensuring individuals privacy rights are protected. The Draft DPDP Rules applies to all entities that process digital personal data, both within India and abroad. The Draft DPDP Rules provide, inter alia, that any entity processing personal data within India or outside India (in relation to offering goods/services to data principals in India) may only transfer personal data to any country/ territory outside India subject to restrictions imposed by the Government of India on making such personal data available to a foreign state or entities or agencies under its control. The Draft DPDP Rules mandate the conduct of data protection impact assessments for high-risk processing activities and requires the notification of data breaches within a stipulated timeframe. The Draft DPDP will be gradually enforced, with timelines for implementation set by the Government of India. Our attempts to comply with applicable legal requirements including the Data Protection Act, Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, among other rules and regulations applicable to us, may not be successful, and may also lead to increased costs for compliance. There can be no assurance that our existing privacy and personal protection systems and technical measures, such as web application firewalls, anti-bot software, automated throttling and IP reputation checks, will be considered sufficient under applicable laws and regulations.
