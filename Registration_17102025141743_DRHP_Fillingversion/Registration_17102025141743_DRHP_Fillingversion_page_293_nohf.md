## Upscaling relationships with existing clients and expanding our client base

We plan to continue to deepen relationships with our existing clients and further expand our client base. In particular, we remain focused on achieving greater penetration within the Hyperscaler client sector and widen our Enterprise client base.

### Hyperscaler clients

As a result of our long-standing position in the Indian market and experience in the industry, we are well-placed to capitalize on the increasing demand for services from Hyperscaler clients in India. According to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, Hyperscaler demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of between 34.5% and 41.7% over the period Fiscal 2025 to Fiscal 2030, with share expected to rise to between 65.0% and 70.0% by Fiscal 2030, driven by the rapid growth in internet usage, increased smartphone penetration and the widespread shift to cloud-based solutions. This is expected to lead to a surge in data consumption and storage needs, making Hyperscaler companies a critical component of the expanding digital ecosystem, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. We aim to cater to both the short-term and long-term data center hosting needs of Hyperscaler clients through deployment of capacity in existing data centers, as well as by offering expanded capacity in our new data center as they become operational. Between Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2025, 2 of our Hyperscaler clients have increased their capacity demand to more than one of our locations.

### Enterprise clients

As a result of increasing data localization and regulatory developments, Indian enterprises are increasingly required to store data within national borders, which drives significant demand for domestic data center capacity, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. This regulatory shift presents a substantial opportunity for us to cater to the needs of enterprises by providing compliant and secure data storage solutions. We plan to continue to strategically allocate a portion of our data center space to Enterprise clients, optimizing margins and enhancing ROCE by focusing on high-value, long-term partnerships. Among the Enterprise clients, we aim to focus on allocating and developing data center space and solutions to cater to the needs of deep technology, manufacturing and semiconductor enterprise players.

In addition to deepening and expanding our Enterprise client relationships, we believe our Sify Group's unified GTM affords us the ability to cross-sell and up-sell our data center hosting services to existing clients of our Promoter, STL, and group company, SDSL, thereby broadening our client base and driving sustainable growth for our Company.

## Strengthen access to interconnection services

In response to rising consumer demand for low-latency solutions, we plan to capitalize on the self-reinforcing cycle of demand between our Hyperscaler and Enterprise clients by enhancing access to and up-selling our interconnection services to our client base. We currently offer our clients the ability to connect from our data centers with more than 1 interconnection point with the availability zones of any cloud service provider.

## Widening our Edge data center presence

According to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, significant rise in real-time content consumption through social media, video streaming, and gaming platforms, along with the proliferation of IoT devices across industries, the demand for edge computing is expected to witness a significant surge. Edge data centers are expected to play an important role in meeting this additional demand, as these trends necessitate ultra-low latency and localized data processing, making Edge data centers increasingly vital for ensuring seamless user experiences and timely decision-making, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. Tailwinds, such as generative AI, cloud adoption, 5G rollout, and the rise of software as a service ("SaaS"), IoT, and connected mobility are further expected to accelerate the need for edge infrastructure.

We plan to enhance our Edge data center presence, to offer our clients the flexibility to adapt to AI- and IoT-driven shifts to meet the growing demands of Edge computing. We are focused on providing mainstream data center-level capabilities in the Edge data center domain to facilitate the requirements of Hyperscaler clients. As of June 30, 2025, we have 2 Edge data centers under development in Lucknow and Chandigarh, with firm commitments for upcoming capacity.

## Our Data Centers

As of June 30, 2025, we had 14 operational colocation data center facilities across 6 major cities in India, comprising 7 data center facilities in Mumbai, 2 data center facilities in Chennai, 2 data center facilities in Noida and 1 data center facility in each of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Our data centers combined had a built IT power capacity of 188.04 MW, as of June 30, 2025.
