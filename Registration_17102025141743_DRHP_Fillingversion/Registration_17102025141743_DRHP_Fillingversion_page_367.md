Notes forming part of the Restated Consolidated financial information

(All amounts are in Indian Rupees millions except share data and as stated)

* The residual value after deducting the financial liability component identified above is to be evaluated under Ind AS 32, for determining whether the financial instrument is a financial liability or equity.

Accordingly, the residual portion of the CCDs is to be presented as a financial liability until the fixed number of shares to be issued upon conversion is determined. Once the fixed number of shares are determined, the residual value should be presented as equity. Further, the Company determined that only the interest on the present value of the future interest obligation on CCDs should be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss rather than the interest amount on the entire CCDs. When the liquidity event happens as per the terms of CCDs, the unmatured portion of the present value of future interest obligation recognized as financial liability should be classified as equity. These CCDs are presented separately as “Other Equity” and will be presented as non-controlling interest upon issue of equity shares in the future. For additional information, see Notes D(12), D(13) & D(16) herein.

The opening balance of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest prior period presented has been restated.

C. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1. Foreign currency

(i) Foreign currency transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognized in the financial information using exchange rates prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss for determination of net profit or loss during the period.

(ii) Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to the functional currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations and cash flows are translated to the functional currency using average exchange rates during the period. Any differences arising on such translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. Such differences are included in the foreign currency translation reserve “FCTR” within other components of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed off, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to profit or loss.

2. Financial Instruments

a. Financial Assets

Financial assets comprises investments in equity and debt securities, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets.

Initial recognition:

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value except trade receivables. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
