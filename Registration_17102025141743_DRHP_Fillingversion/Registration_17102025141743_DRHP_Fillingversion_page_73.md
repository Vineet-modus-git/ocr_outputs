The occurrence of any of the above factors may lead to financial instability and increased volatility in the Indian financial markets and adversely affect the Indian economy and financial sector and us. Negative economic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficits, or a default on national debt, in other emerging market countries, may also affect investor confidence and cause increased volatility in Indian securities markets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. While recent Indian governments have been focused on encouraging private participation in the industrial sector, any adverse change in policy could result in a slowdown of the Indian economy and the GoI may introduce policy changes in response. In addition, these policies will need continued support from stable regulatory regimes that stimulate and encourage the investment of private capital into industrial development. Additionally, an increase in trade deficit, a downgrading in India's sovereign debt rating or a decline in India's foreign exchange reserves could negatively impact interest rates and liquidity, which could adversely impact the Indian economy and our business. Any downturn in the macroeconomic environment in India, or any slowdown or perceived slowdown in the Indian economy, or in specific sectors of the Indian economy, could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**64. If our key clients are unable to continue to grow their operations in India, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted.**

Our growth depends, among other factors, on the growth of our key clients and the scope of their operations in India. In particular, the financial condition of our Hyperscaler clients may be impacted by global macroeconomic factors and national economic conditions and prospects in India, all of which are beyond our control. A decline in our clients' business performance may also lead to a corresponding decrease in demand for our services. Insufficient demand for data center solutions may also prevent growth in demand for our services, and consequently, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
