Our data centers in Airoli, Mumbai (the “Airoli Data Center”), and Bengaluru (the “Bengaluru Data Center”) are built to accommodate cloud hosting (public and hybrid cloud hosting), and our other data centers are equipped with cooling technologies, such as air, liquid, and/or immersion cooling, to cater to varied workloads. For example, the Tower 5 facility at our data center campus in Rabale, Mumbai (the “Rabale Data Center”), was the first in India to be certified by NVIDIA as a DGX-ready data center for air and liquid cooling, showcasing our capability to support AI workloads, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. The Chennai 02 data center in Siruseri (the “Chennai 02 Data Center”) was the first in India to host an on-premises subsea data cable landing station, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. Our most recently-developed data center facilities (the Rabale Data Center campus (Tower 5), the Chennai 02 Data Center (Tower B) and the Noida 02 Data Center (Tower B)) are equipped to handle AI-related applications with specifications that can host workloads of up to 130 kilowatt (“kW”) per rack using direct-to-chip technology. These facilities include higher computing density, increased power availability per rack, and advanced cooling infrastructure to manage the heat generated by high-performance chips. Further, through our efficient build, design and cooling technologies, we are able to consistently achieve industry-parallel power usage effectiveness (“PUE”) levels, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. Moreover, our facilities are carrier-"}]
