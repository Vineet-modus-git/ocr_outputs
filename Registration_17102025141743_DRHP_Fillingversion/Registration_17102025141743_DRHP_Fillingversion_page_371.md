## Notes forming part of the Restated Consolidated financial information

(All amounts are in Indian Rupees millions except share data and as stated)

The acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a 'business' as per Ind AS 103 is accounted for by identifying and recognizing the individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The cost of the group of assets is allocated to such individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values on the date of purchase.

Business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control have been accounted for using the pooling of interests method.

### 6. Intangible assets

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the intangible asset.

#### Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

#### Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives

Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the three months period ended June 30, 2025 and financial years ended March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Estimate of useful life in years</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>System software</td><td>1 - 3</td></tr></tbody></table>

Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.

### 7. Leases

#### As a lessee

The Company's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land and buildings. The company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time

in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset ("ROU") and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.
