* **Lifecycle IRR view:** Returns assume long-term hold; early exits or monetization events may yield different outcomes.
* **Sector evolution:** The data center industry in India is nascent and evolving; long-term performance is subject to change.
* **Depreciation:** Straight-line method of depreciation used (implied depreciation rate of 6%); Useful life taken to calculate depreciation:
  - Shell: 28 years
  - PBB: 15 years
  - POD: 15 years
* For FCFF, working capital and residual book value of assets have been added back at terminal year of project, i.e., year 21.

## Sensitivity of IRR to capital expenditure assumptions

Return metrics for data center investments are sensitive to upfront capital expenditure, given the high fixed cost nature of the asset class. Variations in capital expenditure per MW can lead to meaningful shifts in project-level returns, especially in long-duration, capacity-led business models.

In our representative scenario of a 50 MW Rated-3 colocation facility in suburban Navi Mumbai, at a capital expenditure of approximately INR 344 million per MW, the project is estimated to generate a post-tax unlevered IRR of 18.5% over the project lifecycle. When capital expenditure increases to approximately INR 380 million per MW (approximately 10% higher), the IRR is estimated to adjust to 16.8% (the pre-tax IRR is estimated to moderate to 21.8% from 24.1%).

This reflects the natural sensitivity of IRR to capital intensity, reinforcing the importance of maintaining cost efficiency and disciplined project execution.

The return profile of a data center is shaped by a mix of operational, financial, and strategic factors. Below are the key financial drivers that influence RoCE and IRR outcomes over the asset lifecycle:

### Revenue per MW

* Higher revenue per MW, as observed in mature or Tier-1 markets (e.g., Global REITs), often reflects premium pricing power, strong customer stickiness, and advanced value-added services (interconnection, cloud on-ramps, managed hosting)
* In India, revenue per MW may initially be lower but is expected to improve with ecosystem development, digital demand growth, and customer mix shift toward high-density workloads (AI, hyperscale cloud, BFSI)

### EBITDA per MW

* EBITDA per MW is a strong indicator of operating leverage and cost efficiency.
* Operators with higher fixed cost absorption, standardized builds, and economies of scale tend to exhibit higher EBITDA per MW.
