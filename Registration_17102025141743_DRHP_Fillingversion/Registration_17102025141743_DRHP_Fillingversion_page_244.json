These frameworks not only guide best practices in energy efficiency and thermal management (ASHRAE) or green building design (IGBC) but also act as business case enablers with environmentally conscious clients and regulators. Increasingly, enterprise clients and global hyperscalers prioritize partners with a demonstrated commitment to corporate governance and transparency. A strong track record of publishing Integrated Reports, Sustainability Reports, and adhering to regulatory frameworks like BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting) enhances credibility. Moreover, obtaining independent ESG ratings reinforces an organization's long-term environmental, social, and governance postureâ€”making it a preferred choice in competitive bids and strategic partnerships."}, {"bbox": [193, 1233, 538, 1269], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## 4.

The growth has been propelled by demand from both hyperscalers and enterprises. With the strong rise in cloud computing, IoT devices, 5G expansion, edge computing and Generative AI, online services, businesses and governments are generating massive volumes of data that require secure, scalable, and energy-efficient infrastructure. AI is one of the key emerging drivers with organizations across industries increasingly leveraging it to substantially improve operations and outcomes. As the digital ecosystem evolves, data centers enable both AI adoption and usage of AI to optimize data center operations. For instance, Google's AI use in one of its data centers has cut hardware cooling costs by 40%. India's efforts to develop LLMs such as Sarvam, will further contribute to the growing AI-driven demand for data centers. Another major driver for data center demand is data localization, such as the RBI's mandate that all banking customer data and any transactional information must be stored within India, due to which the BFSI sector emerges as a significant consumer of data center services. The rising use of e-commerce in the country is also boosting the demand for data centers to handle the growing amount of data being created and managed."}, {"bbox": [293, 1706, 1604, 1807], "category": "Text", "text": "Additionally, the growth in consumer-generated video content and their consumption supported by wider 4G/5G coverage and increasing viewership on OTT platforms is contributing to greater demand for storage and content delivery infrastructure.
