Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including exchange difference relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Interest expense is recognized using effective interest method.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. To the extent the Company borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Company determines the amount of borrowings costs eligible for capitalization by applying a capitalization rate to the expenditure incurred on such asset. The capitalization rate is determined based on the weighted average of borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the Company which are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically towards purchase of the qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs that the Company capitalizes during a period does not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during that period.

## Income Taxes

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.

Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: (i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, (ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and (iii) arising due to taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill, as the same is not deductible for tax purposes.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.

## Fair value measurement

A number of the Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal market or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial information are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. The fair value hierarchy is described below:

Level 1 - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
