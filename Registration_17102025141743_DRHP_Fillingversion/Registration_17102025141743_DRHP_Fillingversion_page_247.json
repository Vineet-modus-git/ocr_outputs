The law also has extraterritorial application, meaning it applies to entities outside India if they process personal data in connection with offering goods or services to individuals in India. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of data fiduciaries who determine how personal data is used and data processors who process data on their behalf. Additionally, the law grants the central government broad regulatory powers, including the authority to make rules on matters such as data localization. Under section 16, if there are other laws in specific sectors that offer stronger data protection or stricter rules on data transfer, those laws will apply along with the DPDPA. For instance, if the DPDPA does not limit how a company like PayPal processes your transaction data, the RBI's rules will still apply.\n*   **RBI Storage of Payment System Data, 2018:** The RBI's directive on the storage of payment system data, issued under sections 10(2) and 18 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, requires all payment system operators (PSOs) to store complete payment data exclusively in India. This includes end-to-end transaction details, customer information, payment credentials, and other payment-sensitive data. While the directive does not restrict data processing, it mandates that once the data is processed, it must be stored only within India.\n*   **Framework for adoption of cloud services by the SEBI regulated entities:** The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has recently introduced a framework for the adoption of cloud services by regulated entities. Under Principle 3 of this framework, data localization requirements are set for cloud service providers (CSPs) hosting the applications, platforms, and services for regulated entities. These CSPs are mandated to store and process RE data only within data centers designated by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and must possess a valid Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification (STQC)."}]
