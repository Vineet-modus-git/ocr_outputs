### Interest rate risk:

Interest rate risk is the risk that an upward movement in interest rates would adversely affect the borrowing costs of the Company.

### Profile

At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Company's interest-bearing financial instruments were as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"></th><th colspan="2">Consolidated</th><th colspan="2">Standalone</th></tr><tr><th>As at<br>June 30, 2025</th><th>As at<br>March 31, 2025</th><th>As at<br>March 31, 2024</th><th>As at<br>March 31, 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Fixed rate instruments</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial assets</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Fixed deposits with banks</td><td>1,749.41</td><td>1,768.87</td><td>3,559.97</td><td>2,131.90</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Financial liabilities</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Borrowings from banks</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>- Borrowings from others</td><td>6,714.73</td><td>6,832.72</td><td>6,111.00</td><td>4,982.71</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable rate instruments</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial liabilities</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Borrowings from banks*</td><td>14,988.49</td><td>16,348.77</td><td>13,771.60</td><td>10,495.39</td></tr><tr><td>- Bank overdrafts</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>333.50</td></tr></tbody></table>

* Term loan from NIIF has a fixed rate of Interest rate for 5 years post which the spread shall be increased or decreased based on terms of loan.

### Fair value sensitivity for fixed rate instruments

The Company does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Company does not designate derivatives (interest rate swaps) as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

### Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments

An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased / (decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Other<br>comprehensive<br>income</th><th>Profit/(loss)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>June 30, 2025</td><td>-</td><td>(0.70)</td></tr><tr><td>March 31, 2025</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>March 31, 2024</td><td>-</td><td>(3.30)</td></tr><tr><td>March 31, 2023</td><td>-</td><td>(5.39)</td></tr></tbody></table>

A decrease of 100 basis points in the interest rates at the reporting date would have had equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variable remain constant.
