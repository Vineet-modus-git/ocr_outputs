Hyderabad continues to see significant investments from Hyperscale Cloud Service Providers. As per media reports, Hyperscaler 1 has committed to investing INR 60,000 crore (approximately USD 7.2 billion) by 2030 to develop its cloud infrastructure in Telangana, with three operational sites already established. Microsoft has acquired 48 acres of land in Hyderabad's Ranga Reddy district for INR 267 crore (approximately USD 32 million) to expand its data center operations.⁵⁴ The Telangana government continues to play a pivotal role in fostering this growth. It offers a range of incentives and expedited approvals through the TS-iPASS system, and land at concessional rates to attract data center investments. The demand is driven by the hyperscaler's needs and growing population of Hyderabad's end-user creating traffic accessing content or services or by people connecting to applications, websites, or services hosted in the data center.

While Mumbai remains the preferred location for data centers due to its proximity to undersea cable landing stations, South Hyderabad offers competitive advantages such as lower real estate costs when compared with Mumbai and robust infrastructure. Strong governmental support, positions Hyderabad as a key player in India's digital transformation landscape.

Hyderabad's data center landscape is primarily segmented into two key micro-markets: West Hyderabad and South Hyderabad. West Hyderabad is largely enterprise-driven and features a strong presence of Domestic colocation operators such as SISL and others.

In contrast, South Hyderabad is predominantly shaped by hyperscale cloud service providers. Hyperscaler 1 operates three self-built facilities in this corridor with built IT capacity of 82 MW, with a further 66 MW in the development pipeline. Hyperscaler 2 is also significantly expanding its footprint, with 72 MW of capacity under construction and an additional 74 MW in the planning stage. Notably, there are currently no operational colocation facilities in South Hyderabad cluster. The remaining pipeline of 48 MW is by colocation players, marking their foray into the South Hyderabad corridor.
