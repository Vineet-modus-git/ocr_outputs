Mumbai, India's financial capital, is now positioned as the data center capital of India. It has firmly established itself as a central hub for data centers in India. The city's strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and robust telecommunications network have catapulted it as a key location in the global data center ecosystem as well as in APAC region. Over the past few years, Mumbai has witnessed significant investments from cloud service providers such as Hyperscaler 1 and global colocation operators such as Global Player 1 and Global Player 2, alongside strong growth from domestic operators such as SISL and Domestic Player 1. A notable trend in the Mumbai market is that 98% of the current built data center capacity is through colocation. A major enabler for Mumbai's rise as a powerhouse is its location which forms a gateway to global connectivity, facilitated by its extensive subsea cable network.

Mumbai, India's largest data center hub, features a cluster-based development model centered around Powai, Thane-Belapur Road (TBR), and Panvelâ€”each with distinct strategic advantages. Powai, a mature and centrally located cluster, is home to major colocation operators. Its strong infrastructure and proximity to enterprise clients in the financial and IT sectors make it a preferred site for data center operations.

Thane-Belapur Road, covering Airoli, Rabale, and Mahape, has emerged as a high-demand corridor, housing 70% of Mumbai's built capacity, driven by key players of the Indian data center market including SISL. With the low vacancy rate of just 6% and a massive 982 MW development pipeline, Thane Belapur Road is set to be a major growth driver for Mumbai's data center market.
