## Our ability to expand power capacity and expertise

Factors like rising digitalization and AI adoption are expected to push data center demand in India from current levels of 1.3 gigawatt ("GW") in Fiscal 2025 to between 4.7 GW and 5.7 GW by Fiscal 2030, representing a compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") of between 30.1% to 35.1% over the period, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. We aim to capitalize on this anticipated demand by expanding our data center capacity and developing new data centers in strategic locations. As of June 30, 2025, we had built IT power capacity of 188.04 MW. In addition, as of June 30, 2025, we had 11 data centers under development, including 4 data centers under development in Mumbai at our Rabale Data Center campus.

However, the costs of building, developing and operating data centers are substantial, and such costs have increased in recent years. We are required to fund the costs of building, developing and operating our data centers with cash retained from operations, as well as from financings from bank and other borrowings. If we cannot generate sufficient capital to meet our anticipated capital requirements or are unable to operate our data centers profitably, our financial condition, business expansion and future prospects could be materially affected.

## Our ability to operate sustainably and keep our power expenses low

The data center industry is a power-intensive industry, and we are committed to the sustainable use of power in our operations. In addition, as the single-largest operating cost for us is electric power, our profitability and results of operations depend on our ability to keep our power expenses and operating costs low. The following table sets forth our power expenses for the period/Fiscals indicated.

Note:

(1) Power expenses comprises electricity power expenses and fuel expenses.

We prioritize sustainability through a combination of energy efficiency and the implementation of carbon-free and renewable energy solutions, including by entering into power purchase agreements ("PPAs") for renewable energy. We are focused on continuing to make strategic investments into renewable energy sources and increasingly integrating sustainability principles into our operations.

We achieve further power efficiencies by adopting efficient build and design methodologies for our data centers and introducing advanced and innovative cooling technologies and water efficiency initiatives. Through our efficient build, design and cooling technologies, we are able to consistently achieve power usage effectiveness ("PUE") levels that are industry-parallel, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report.

## Macroeconomic conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, in particular conditions that impact Internet usage rates, smartphone penetration rates in India, the proliferation of cloud-based solutions or AI-related workloads, may affect demand for our services, and consequently our profitability and growth prospects. In particular, if demand for AI workloads or IoT applications does not grow in line with market expectations, or the Internet ecosystem in India develops slower than we estimate, actual demand for data center solutions may be substantially lower than we anticipate, which might have a material adverse impact on our business, profitability and results of operations.

## Key Components of our Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss

Below is a description of the key components of our restated consolidated statement of profit and loss.

### Income

**Revenue from operations.** Revenue from operations primarily comprises revenue from data center services. This includes capacity-related revenue, namely charges for co-location of racks and cross connect charges, and power-related revenues, relating to electricity charges, which is typically pass-through revenue. We charge for data center services as distinct services based on actual consumption. Revenue from operations is not linear in nature and depends on our ability to bring new IT power capacity online and our clients taking up such IT power capacity. Typically, it takes us between two and three years to bring a data center to full capacity allocation, subject to client demand. We generally enter into fixed-price, fixed-term contracts with our clients. The performance obligations are satisfied over time. Service revenue is recognized as the related services are performed. Sale of equipment, such as servers, cable infrastructure and racks, are accounted as separate performance obligations if they are distinct and its related revenues are recognized at a point in time when the
