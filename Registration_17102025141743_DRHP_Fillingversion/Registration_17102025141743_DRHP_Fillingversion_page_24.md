Notes:

The ratios have been computed as follows:

1. Net worth means the aggregate value of the paid-up share capital and all reserves created out of the profits and securities premium account and debit or credit balance of profit and loss account, after deducting the aggregate value of the accumulated losses, deferred expenditure and miscellaneous expenditure not written off, as per the restated audited balance sheet, but does not include reserves created out of revaluation of assets, write-back of depreciation, amalgamation and capital reserve.

2. Profit/(loss) after tax for the relevant fiscal/period as per Restated Consolidated Financial Information.

3. Net Asset Value per Equity Share represents Net Worth as at the end of the relevant fiscal/period, as divided by the number of Equity Shares outstanding on fully diluted basis at the end of the relevant Fiscal/period.

4. Total borrowings represent sum of long term and short term borrowings.
