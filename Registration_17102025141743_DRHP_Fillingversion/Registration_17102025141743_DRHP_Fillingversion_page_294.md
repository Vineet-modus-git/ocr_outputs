Data centers are dedicated physical infrastructure used to house computer systems, related storage systems and associated components. Data centers serve as repositories for IT equipment, such as physical servers, storage subsystems, networking switches, routers and firewalls, as well as the cabling and physical racks used to organize and interconnect the IT equipment. Data centers also comprise supportive infrastructure, such as power distribution and supplemental power subsystems.

The following is a description of our 14 operational data centers facilities, as of June 30, 2025.

## Rabale Data Center campus

The Rabale Data Center campus is a mega data center campus designed with flexibility for capacity expansion. It is one of our newest and largest data centers by size and capabilities. The Rabale Data Center campus is designed to accommodate 12 Towers. As of June 30, 2025, the Rabale Data Center campus had 5 operational Towers (Towers 1 â€“ 5) with a combined built IT power capacity of 96.94 MW.

The Rabale Data Center campus is designed to serve and meet the needs of Hyperscaler clients and to facilitate AI-related workloads. In particular, the Tower 5 facility at the Rabale Data Center campus is a fully Hyperscale-ready data center with 43.20 MW of built IT power capacity, as of June 30, 2025, and is equipped to handle AI-related applications with specifications that can host workloads for up to 130 kW per rack using direct-to-chip technology.

The Tower 5 facility was the first in India to be certified by NVIDIA as a DGX-ready data center for air and liquid cooling, showcasing our capability to support AI workloads, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. In addition, the Tower 5 facility has obtained TIA-942 Rated 4 certification, which signifies the highest level of data center certification awarded by the TIA for facilities that are fully fault-tolerant with redundant systems for all critical components.

At the Rabale Data Center campus, we facilitate access to multiple Hyperscaler clouds, OTT ecosystems and ISPs with low-latency. We also offer build-to-suit and multi-tenant data centers, with dual meet-me-rooms and a large number of network interconnects at the Rabale Data Center campus.

Other key facilities at the Rabale Data Center campus include the following.

* Towers 1, 2 and 3 at the Rabale Data Center campus have an on-premises 110 KV substation, which helps ensure uninterrupted power supply.
* Towers 4 and 5 at the Rabale Data Center campus have an on-premises 220 kV GIS substation to ensure uninterrupted high-capacity power supply.
* The Rabale Data Center campus has high floor-to-ceiling space and heavy load-bearing floors that can accommodate large and heavy systems for AI-related work applications.

In addition, the Rabale Data Center campus was designed in line with our sustainability commitments and uses a combination of renewable energy and grid energy to power operations. Renewable energy is used to power up to 70.00% of the operations at the Rabale Data Center campus and is sourced from a combination of solar and wind generation through our PPAs.
