The BFSI sector relies on data centers for real-time financial transactions, fraud detection, and data security. With the surge in digital banking, mobile payments, and high-frequency trading, BFSI companies are increasingly investing in hybrid and private cloud infrastructure to ensure data privacy and compliance with evolving regulations. Data centers also enable advanced analytics, AI-driven risk assessments, and improved customer experiences through faster transaction processing and enhanced service availability. India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been a significant driver of this digital transformation, processing a record 18.3 billion‚Åµ transactions, necessitating robust data center infrastructures to handle the escalating transaction volumes and ensure seamless financial operations. In addition to traditional BFSI, the rise of other fintech players like digital lending platforms, neobanks, insurance tech and investment apps, has significantly contributed to the demand for agile, scalable data infrastructure.
