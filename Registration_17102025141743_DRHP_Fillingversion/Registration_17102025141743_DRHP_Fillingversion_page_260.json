Additionally, AI adoption is expected to contribute to the shift towards data centers, as traditional server rooms lack the power, cooling, and scalability needed for AI workloads. The current colo versus captive data center capacity split is estimated at 60:40, compared to approximately 45:55 five years ago, and is projected to reach approximately 70:30 over the next five years, reflecting a sustained migration away from captive facilities. As enterprises migrate from private server rooms to robust data center / colocation solutions, the industry is witnessing sustained growth, positioning data centers as critical components of enterprises' digital infrastructure."}, {"bbox": [289, 313, 1536, 1276], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [298, 1300, 769, 1332], "category": "Text", "text": "Source(s): Industry reports, News articles, Lattice analysis"}, {"bbox": [192, 1354, 1082, 1394], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 4.3.4 Foreign players may increasingly colocate to data centers in India"}, {"bbox": [289, 1415, 1605, 1738], "category": "Text", "text": "India is rapidly positioning itself as a global hotspot for data center investments, driven by strong digital growth and favorable economics. Between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2025, India's data center demand grew by 28.1%, rising from 0.4 GW to 1.3 GW, and is projected to reach 4.7 – 5.7 GW by Fiscal 2030, growing at a 30.1 – 35.1% CAGR. Major data center players in India saw revenue grow at approximately 24% CAGR from Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2023, driven by capacity additions. The trend is expected to continue, with revenue projected to grow at approximately 32% CAGR during Fiscal 2024 to Fiscal 2026. Global technology companies have already entered the Indian market; for instance, NVIDIA has partnered with Tata Group and Reliance Industries to build supercomputing data centers and AI infrastructure. India's combination of scale, talent pool, lower capital expenditure cost, and rapid digital transformation makes it a preferred destination for countries across the globe looking to meet their data infrastructure needs."}, {"bbox": [291, 1762, 856, 1799], "category": "Section-header", "text": "#### i.

However, due to concerns around high energy consumption and limited land availability, the government imposed a moratorium on new data center developments in calendar year 2019. This pause was lifted in calendar year 2022, but only under strict sustainability guidelines requiring operators to meet high energy efficiency standards and integrate renewable energy sources. These regulatory and infrastructural constraints have prompted many Singapore-based data center players to look beyond their domestic market to share the upcoming data center demand. Emerging"}]
