Unlike traditional systems, which use binary bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers can analyze many possibilities at once. This is due to the unique way quantum systems are designed; they can hold and evaluate multiple potential outcomes in parallel, making them considerably faster for certain tasks."}, {"bbox": [294, 889, 709, 923], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**Key considerations in data centers**"}, {"bbox": [294, 948, 1269, 983], "category": "Text", "text": "Quantum computing has the potential to disrupt data center operations in several ways:"}, {"bbox": [294, 1009, 1602, 1405], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Faster data processing:** Quantum computers can handle huge amounts of data at once, speeding up tasks like AI training and system simulations. This also helps manage workloads better and reduces slowdowns.\n* **Evolving cybersecurity landscape:** Quantum tech could break today's encryption, so data centers will need new, stronger security systems. New methods like post-quantum encryption and smart verification (like zero-knowledge proofs) will help keep data safe.\n* **Improved simulation and modelling:** Quantum computing enables data centers to run complex simulations such as capacity planning, cooling optimization, or network traffic modelling. Quantum-enhanced digital twins (virtual replicas of infrastructure) can help to monitor infrastructure in real time, predict failures, and schedule preventive maintenance.\n* **Reduced energy consumption:** By solving high-complexity problems more efficiently, quantum computing can lower the energy demands of data centers. It also reduces dependence on large-scale hardware, making operations more space- and energy-efficient."}, {"bbox": [294, 1430, 794, 1468], "category": "Section-header", "text": "Value proposition of quantum computing"}, {"bbox": [294, 1485, 1542, 1997], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [294, 2009, 640, 2030], "category": "Text", "text": "Source(s): Industry reports, News articles, Lattice analysis"}]
