SISL has emerged as a differentiated player in India's digital infrastructure space by aligning its services with the evolving needs of enterprises, hyperscalers, and government organizations. SISL's parent company, Sify Technologies Limited played a pivotal role in India's digital transformation in the 1990's and its longevity of over 25 years in the network, data center services and digital services space in India, including being the first commercial data center in India enables them to be regarded as one of the credible and competitive players in India. Sify Technologies Limited has established itself as a pioneer in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry, known for its innovation and leadership. It was the first to offer private internet services in India in the late 1990s and was the first Indian ICT company to list on NASDAQ in October 1999. As a one-stop IT partner, Sify Technologies Limited offers integrated hybrid cloud, colocation, and managed services, allowing businesses to streamline their digital operations through a single provider. The company is also investing in building future-ready data centers designed for AI and high-density computing, backed by robust network connectivity with flexible carrier options. High standards of security and compliance make it a trusted choice for sensitive workloads, while its strong commitment to sustainability further strengthens its position in the market increasingly driven by ESG priorities.

### 5.3.2.1 Differentiation strategies adopted

**1. One-stop IT partner with strong hybrid cloud capabilities**

Sify Technologies Limited serves as an integrated provider of IT infrastructure services, offering a consolidated suite that includes data centers, network connectivity, cloud storage, cybersecurity, and managed IT support. This unified approach reduces the complexity for enterprises that would otherwise rely on multiple service providers. Sify Digital Services Limited (SDSL), the digital arm of Sify Technologies Limited specializes in delivering advanced digital transformation solutions, including applications, platform, tools and services, IT infrastructure management, and cybersecurity for in-house use. Sify CloudInfinit Service's in-house cloud platform, is designed to operate in close integration with SISL's data center infrastructure, enabling effective deployment of hybrid cloud models that combine on-premises systems with cloud-based environments. This integrated setup supports operational efficiency, scalability, and simplified infrastructure management for client organizations.⁹⁴ The integration allows clients to source all core infrastructure needs from a single provider, increasing stickiness and reducing client churn—a direct benefit to the data center business through bundled service uptake.

**2. Building future-ready and AI data centers**

SISL is focusing on creating massive, advanced data center campuses in cities like Mumbai, Chennai, and Noida to meet the needs of big tech companies (called hyperscalers) and large enterprises. These campuses are designed to handle very high power and cooling demands. To support the rising use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), Sify is developing special “AI-ready” infrastructure. This includes high-performance systems with advanced cooling methods, like liquid cooling, which are essential for running powerful AI hardware like GPUs. The tower 5 facility of Rabale, Mumbai data center was the first in India to be certified by NVIDIA as a DGX-Ready data center for air and liquid cooling, showcasing SISL's capability to support AI workloads.⁹⁵ The Tower B facility at the Chennai 02 data center and the Tower B facility at the Noida 02 data center have also received NVIDIA-certified DGX-Ready status for AI workloads and liquid cooling.⁹⁶

**3. Strong network connectivity with flexible provider options**

SISL's data centers are built to support strong and flexible network connections. They allow customers to connect to various Cloud service platforms (carrier-neutral), rather than being tied to one. These centers also host important internet exchange points and have dense fiber networks, which help ensure faster and more reliable connections. Located in key hub coastal cities, such as Mumbai and Chennai and close to international undersea cable landing points, Sify's data centers offer low-latency access and strong global connectivity. SISL's Chennai facility at Siruseri is the first in India to host an on-premises subsea data cable landing station.
