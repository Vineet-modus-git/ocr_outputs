Since the act has been enacted already, the rules are expected to be notified soon, kickstarting the data localization process. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) enforces localization of payment data, directly impacting banks, fintechs, and payment processors. Additionally, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has recommended that telecom data should be stored domestically, adding further compliance requirements, and further boosting data localization. As the DPDPA moves closer to operationalisation, the upcoming rules are expected to encourage more enterprises to bring data workloads onshore, especially those in regulated sectors or classified as Significant Data Fiduciaries. This shift is likely to benefit both hyperscalers expanding their India footprint and enterprise-grade private / public cloud setups housed in domestic data centers. Over time, this could lead to a more diversified mix of hyperscaler and enterprise workloads in India's data center market."}, {"bbox": [290, 509, 1605, 612], "category": "Text", "text": "India's expanding digital economy is also playing a pivotal role in accelerating new capacities.

Currently, 67% of Indian companies are shifting applications to the cloud, reinforcing a national trend towards moving away from traditional methods like server rooms. This migration is not monolithic. While some enterprises opt for colocation in private clouds, a substantial and growing number are adopting hybrid and public cloud strategies. Players of scale and medium-sized enterprises are leveraging public cloud providers for scalability, cost-efficiency, and access to advanced services like AI and machine learning. Simultaneously, they often retain certain critical applications or sensitive data in a private cloud or on-premise environment, leading to a hybrid model. This nuance is crucial; the movement is not simply from on-premise to a single alternative, but a strategic reallocation of workloads across private, public, and hybrid environments to optimize for cost, performance, and security. This shift is occurring due to the demand for flexible IT infrastructure, reducing reliance on in-house"}]
