The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected term (or \"option life\") and risk free interest rates. In respect of the options granted, the expected term is estimated based on the vesting term, contractual term as well as expected exercise behaviour of the employees receiving the option. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Share prices for the year 2011-12 have been eliminated in determining volatility as there had been extra ordinary price movements during the said period on account of capital infusion by promoters. Dividend yield of the options is based on the recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the Government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in the future periods, stock compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years."}, {"bbox": [225, 2062, 1496, 2160], "category": "Text", "text": "The estimated fair value of stock options is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.
