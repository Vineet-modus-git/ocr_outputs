India already boasts a massive internet user base of 954 million, significantly higher than the USA's 311 million, making it one of the largest online populations globally. One of the major propellers of the rapid digital growth in India has been the low cost of mobile data. The average price of 1 GB of mobile data is USD 0.16 in India, while the world average is USD 2.59. However, with internet penetration at just 58%, compared to over 90% in developed countries like the USA and the UK, there is still substantial room for growth. This gap highlights a major opportunity: as infrastructure improves and digital access expands across rural and underserved regions, millions more Indians are expected to come online. This makes India one of the most promising markets for digital services, content platforms, and tech-driven businesses in the years to come."}, {"bbox": [248, 428, 989, 965], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><caption>Global digital statistics (CY24)</caption><thead><tr><th></th><th>Units</th><th>Global</th><th>USA</th><th>China</th><th>India</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope=\"row\">Size of digital economy</th><td>USD T</td><td>12.5</td><td>2.9</td><td>2.4</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Internet users</th><td>M</td><td>5,240</td><td>311</td><td>1,105</td><td>954</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Internet penetration</th><td>%</td><td>65</td><td>93</td><td>78</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">Time spent online per user per day</th><td>Hours</td><td>6.4</td><td>7.3</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">5G penetration</th><td>%</td><td>20</td><td>75</td><td>71</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">DC capacity</th><td>GW</td><td>-</td><td>23.0</td><td>4.5</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"row\">DC density</th><td>MW per M pop<sup>a</sup></td><td>-</td><td>~68</td><td>~3</td><td>~1</td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"bbox": [248, 975, 453, 996], "category": "Text", "text": "Note(s): Popª refers to Population"}, {"bbox": [248, 993, 836, 1014], "category": "Text", "text": "Source(s): Estimation and measurement of India's digital economy report (Jan'25), ILattice analysis"}, {"bbox": [1041, 428, 1545, 1011], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [243, 1070, 1559, 1363], "category": "Text", "text": "The global adoption of 5G technology is still emerging, with penetration at 20% in calendar year 2024.

A major driver alongside the government push comes from Indian enterprises, which are rapidly digitizing, adopting cloud infrastructure, and investing in enterprise IT systems at scale. To drive this growth, the government has launched key initiatives such as Digital India, BharatNet for rural internet access, DigiLocker for digital document storage, and the IndiaAI Mission to promote artificial intelligence across sectors. Digital India drives massive data generation and digital transactions, increasing the need for scalable and secure data center infrastructure. BharatNet expands internet access to rural areas, leading to higher data traffic and the requirement for distributed, low-latency data centers. DigiLocker relies on secure and compliant data centers to host sensitive digital documents reliably. Meanwhile, the IndiaAI Mission promotes AI adoption that depends heavily on high-performance data centers capable of intensive computing and large-scale data"}, {"bbox": [243, 2192, 322, 2215], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "4 World Bank"}]
