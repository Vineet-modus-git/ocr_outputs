Negative economic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficits, or a default on national debt, in other emerging market countries, may also affect investor confidence and cause increased volatility in Indian securities markets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. While recent Indian governments have been focused on encouraging private participation in the industrial sector, any adverse change in policy could result in a slowdown of the Indian economy and the GoI may introduce policy changes in response. In addition, these policies will need continued support from stable regulatory regimes that stimulate and encourage the investment of private capital into industrial development. Additionally, an increase in trade deficit, a downgrading in India's sovereign debt rating or a decline in India's foreign exchange reserves could negatively impact interest rates and liquidity, which could adversely impact the Indian economy and our business.
