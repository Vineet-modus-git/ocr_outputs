Government incentives can pave way for hyperscaler demand to come in large tracts to India, provided they are supported by government policies through minimal red tape, availability of surplus and reliable power supply, sustainability efforts, and prior marked land campuses. Hyperscaler demand is expected to grow at 34.5 - 41.7% CAGR during Fiscal 2025 to Fiscal 2030, with share expected to rise to 65.0 - 70.0% by Fiscal 2030, driven by the rapid growth in internet usage, increased smartphone penetration, and the widespread shift to cloud-based solutions. This is expected to lead to a surge in data consumption and storage needs, making hyperscalers a critical component of the expanding digital ecosystem. SISL's hyperscaler client base included 3 of top 4 global hyperscaler companies (based on cloud service revenue in Q2 calendar year 2024) operating in India, as on June 30, 2025.
