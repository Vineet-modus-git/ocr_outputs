### Subsequent measurement:

The financial liabilities are classified for subsequent measurement into following categories:

- at amortised cost

- at fair value through profit or loss

(i) Financial liabilities at amortised cost

The company is classifying the following financial liabilities at amortised cost;

a) Compulsorily convertible debentures

b) Borrowings from banks

c) Borrowings from others

d) Finance lease liabilities

e) Trade payables

f) Other financial liabilities

Amortised cost for financial liabilities represents amount at which financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount.

(ii) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at FVTPL.

### Compound Financial Instrument:

The terms of a non-derivative compound financial instrument are evaluated to determine whether it contains both a liability and an equity component. Such components are classified as financial liabilities, financial assets or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Interest, dividends and gains relating to the component that is financial liability is recognized as income or expense in profit or loss. Distribution to holders of equity instruments is recognized directly in equity."

### "Derecognition of financial liabilities:

A financial liability shall be derecognised when, and only when, it is extinguished i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

### c. Derivative financial instruments

Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are entered into by the Company to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with certain payables, receivables and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. The Company also enters into cross currency and interest rate swaps for hedging the risk against variability in cash flows of its term loan. These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, and are initially recognized at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are recognized in profit or loss.

### d. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities when, and only when, the Company has a legal right to offset the recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously.

### e. Reclassification of financial assets

The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets (which are categorised as equity instruments) at FVTOCI and financial assets or liabilities that are specifically designated as FVTPL. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be very infrequent. The management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant to the Company's operations. A change in the business model occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change in business model. The Company does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.

## 3. Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as Equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or share options are recognized as a deduction from Equity, net of any tax effects.
