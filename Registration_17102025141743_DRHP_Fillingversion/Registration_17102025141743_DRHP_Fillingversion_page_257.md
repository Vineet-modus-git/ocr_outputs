4.3 Catalysts for increase in future demand of data centers

4.3.1 Generative AI and AI diffusion

Generative AI is rapidly gaining momentum in India, with increasing adoption and development across various sectors. The country is emerging as a global leader in the use of generative AI, currently ranking second only to the United States in the use of generative AI for consumer applications. Businesses across industries are actively exploring ways to leverage generative AI, from automating repetitive tasks to enhancing overall workplace productivity. As adoption deepens, AI is helping companies reduce operational costs, enhance service delivery, and unlock new revenue streams, cementing its role as a key driver of digital transformation in India's IT sector. This growing reliance on generative AI is also reshaping the underlying compute infrastructure required to support such workloads. As models become more complex and data-intensive, there is a heightened demand for advanced hardware capable of parallel processing and high-speed computation. In the near future, GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 will significantly replace many compute requirements traditionally handled by CPUs. These GPUs, initially used for cutting-edge AI tasks, will eventually be utilized for more basic AI, graphics, and compute-intensive workloads. With the approval of the IndiaAI Mission in 2024, the government allocated INR 10,300 Cr over five years to strengthen the country's AI capabilities. A major objective of the mission is the development of a high-end common computing facility equipped with 18,693 GPUs positioning it among the largest AI compute infrastructures globally. This capacity is nearly nine times that of the open-source AI model DeepSeek and approximately two-thirds of what powers ChatGPT. In the initial phase, 10,000 GPUs have already been made available, with the remaining units to be deployed soon. This infrastructure will enable the development of indigenous AI solutions tailored to Indian languages and local contexts. Local ecosystem support for AI in India, AI-driven workloads are expected to increase significantly and become a major contributor to data center demand, with 0.7 â€“ 1.1 GW of additional capacity expected to be required by Fiscal 2030 to cater to AI-related workloads. As AI adoption scales, the diffusion of AI workloads across enterprises will depend on factors like cost, ecosystem maturity, and hardware availability. While India is well-positioned with government support and growing AI use cases, the global scarcity of rare earth metals, critical for GPUs and advanced chips, could act as a supply-side constraint, potentially moderating the pace of infrastructure buildout.

At the same time, the rapid expansion of cloud computing, 5G deployment, ML, and the IoT is generating an enormous volume of data and growing storage needs. Additionally, the high-performance computing demands of generative AI are driving a surge in demand for data center capacity. This presents a significant opportunity for data center operators, as the infrastructure backbone becomes increasingly critical in supporting India's AI-driven future.
