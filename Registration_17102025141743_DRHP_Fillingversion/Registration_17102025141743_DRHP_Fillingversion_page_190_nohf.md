The following comparison highlights the variance in HT (High Tension) Commercial vs. Industrial tariffs across key Indian states as of March 31, 2024:³⁷

As per the Tariff Book 2024 by Central Electricity Authority of India

* **Maharashtra** shows the steepest differential (INR 4.71/kWh), making industrial classification critical for operational cost efficiency.
* **Karnataka** and **Delhi NCR** also display notable differences (approx. INR 1.00–INR 1.85/kWh), underscoring the importance of ensuring proper categorization during connection approval.
* In **Telangana**, however, industrial tariffs are slightly higher than commercial- a deviation from the national pattern, requiring scrutiny during project planning.
* **Tamil Nadu** and **West Bengal** show minimal differences, though cumulative duties and surcharges still make industrial rates more favorable in net terms.

## II. Incentive environment and implications for data centers:

While direct electricity subsidies or capital incentives targeted specifically at data center remain limited in these states, certain regions (e.g., Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, etc) have announced data center-specific policies in recent years (refer to 2.1.2.2 Policy level interventions for data centers and implications on data center growth). These often include:

* Waivers or reimbursement of electricity duty for a defined period
* Special energy tariffs for hyperscale and cloud service providers

The presence of multiple DISCOMs in states such as Maharashtra and Delhi NCR also introduce competition, allowing large consumers to negotiate preferential rates or select distribution licensee with lower tariffs (e.g., AEML vs MSEDCL in Maharashtra). From a cost optimization lens, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and select DISCOMs in Maharashtra (e.g., AEML) offer favorable electricity pricing for data center.

### 2.1.4.5 Availability of renewable energy

As India strides toward its ambitious climate goals, renewable energy has become a cornerstone of the country's power strategy—especially for power-intensive industries like data centers. Driven by both national commitments and operational imperatives, the integration of solar, wind, hydro, and emerging clean energy sources has become essential to the viability of future-ready and ESG-aligned data centers.

#### I. India's renewable energy landscape – a transformative decade

As of October 2024, India's installed renewable energy capacity has reached 203.18 GW, constituting 46.3% of the country's total electricity generation capacity (452.69 GW). This figure marks a dramatic shift from a fossil-dominated grid to one increasingly reliant on solar (92.12 GW), wind (47.72 GW), large hydro (46.93 GW), and bioenergy (11.32 GW). The total non-fossil capacity—including nuclear (8.18 GW)—now exceeds 211 GW, reinforcing India's commitment to a decarbonized future.³⁸This growth aligns with India's Paris Agreement targets, including achieving 50% cumulative electric power capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030, reducing emissions intensity by 45% from 2005 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

#### II. State-wise renewable energy profile

Certain states are at the forefront of renewable energy generation, offering abundant and diversified sources suitable for data center hubs.³⁹ As seen earlier in the table State-wise Deep Dive on Power Generation in MU, the spread of Renewable energy Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra offer large-scale access to both solar and wind, making them highly attractive for data center expansion from a renewable sourcing perspective.

#### III. Renewable energy for data centers to achieve sustainability goals

Renewable energy plays a pivotal role in decarbonizing data center operations. The most commonly used sources include solar, wind, and hydropower, each contributing to reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Solar
