Unless stated otherwise, all references to a year in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus are to a calendar year and references to the terms Fiscal or Fiscal Year or Financial Year are to the 12 months ended March 31 of such year.

Unless stated otherwise or where the context otherwise requires, the financial information and financial ratios in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus is derived from the Restated Consolidated Financial Information.

Restated consolidated financial information of our Company and SKVR, its Associate, comprising the restated consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as at June 30, 2025 and as at March 31, 2025, the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), the restated consolidated statement of changes in equity, the restated consolidated statement of cash flows for the three month period ended June 30, 2025 and for the year ended March 31, 2025, the summary of material accounting policies, and other explanatory information, and the restated standalone statement of assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, the restated standalone statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), the restated standalone statement of changes in equity, the restated standalone statement of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, prepared in accordance with Ind AS and as per requirement of Section 26 of Part I of Chapter III of the Companies Act, 2013, SEBI ICDR Regulations, as amended and the Guidance Note on ‘Reports in Company Prospectuses (Revised 2019)’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, as amended from time to time. For further information, see “Restated Consolidated Financial Information” beginning on page 349.

There are significant differences between Ind AS, Indian GAAP, US GAAP and IFRS. Our Company does not provide reconciliation of its financial information to IFRS or US GAAP. Our Company has not attempted to explain those differences or quantify their impact on the financial data included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus and it is urged that you consult your own advisors regarding such differences and their impact on our Company’s financial data. For details in connection with risks involving differences between Ind AS, U.S. GAAP and IFRS see “Risk Factors – 60. Differences exist between Ind AS (“Indian Accounting Standards”) and other accounting principles, such as U.S. GAAP (“Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America”) and IFRS (“International Financial Reporting Standards”), which investors may be more familiar with and may consider material to their assessment of our financial condition” on page 67. Accordingly, the degree to which the financial information included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus will provide meaningful information is entirely dependent on the reader’s level of familiarity with Indian accounting policies and practices, the Companies Act, 2013, Ind AS and the SEBI ICDR Regulations. Any reliance by persons not familiar with Indian accounting policies and practices on the financial disclosures presented in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus should accordingly be limited.

In this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, any discrepancies in any table between the total and the sums of the amounts listed are due to rounding off. All figures in decimals have been rounded off to the second decimal place and all percentage figures have been rounded off to two decimal places. However, where any figures that may have been sourced from third-party industry sources are rounded off to other than two decimal points in their respective sources, such figures appear in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus as rounded-off to such number of decimal points as provided in such respective sources.

Unless the context otherwise indicates, any percentage amounts, or ratios (excluding certain operational metrics) as set forth in “Risk Factors”, “Our Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
