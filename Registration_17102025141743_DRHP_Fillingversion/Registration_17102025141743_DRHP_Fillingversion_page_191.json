Many hyperscalers and colocation providers are now integrating these sources through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), green tariffs, or on-site generation, aligning their sustainability commitments with operational resilience and long-term cost efficiency."}, {"bbox": [344, 318, 1559, 545], "category": "Text", "text": "Meanwhile, Nuclear power is also vital to cater for the constant, high energy demands of AI-driven data centers. Unlike intermittent renewables, nuclear offers reliable, 24/7 output. Although it is costly to build, reactors provide low operating costs and scalable generation—typically 800+ MW is produced by a reactor—making them a dependable energy solution. The Union Budget 2025 – 2026 has allocated INR 20,000 crore for R&D in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), targeting at least five indigenously designed operational SMRs by 2033. This aligns with India's target of 100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047.⁴⁰ Some of the key benefits of nuclear energy in data centers are outlined below.⁴¹"}, {"bbox": [344, 573, 1541, 936], "category": "List-item", "text": "*   **Reliable baseload power:** Provides stable 24/7 supply, unlike intermittent renewables.\n*   **Low carbon emissions:** Supports net-zero and sustainability goals.\n*   **Scalable and efficient:** High energy density and SMRs offer compact, reliable solutions for growing demands.\n*   **Long-term cost efficiency:** High upfront costs offset by low operating expenses and long lifespan.\n*   **Grid stability and security:** Enhances resilience by complementing renewables and reducing fossil fuel dependence."}, {"bbox": [243, 963, 1557, 1032], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## IV.

Intra-state policies, like Uttar Pradesh's 2021 incentives, promote renewable use within states. Inter-state policies enable open access to cheaper or greener power from neighboring states.⁴²\n*   **Nuclear, tidal and hydrogen:** These 3 energy sources are emerging as next-generation solutions to meet the data center industry's growing demand for sustainable and reliable power. Nuclear reactors like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) offer a stable, zero-carbon baseload ideal for hyperscale operations. Tidal energy, with its predictability and low environmental impact, presents a viable option for coastal data center developments.
