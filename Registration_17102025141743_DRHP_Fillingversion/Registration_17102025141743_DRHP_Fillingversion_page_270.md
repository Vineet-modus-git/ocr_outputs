## VII. Customer churn

Customer churn in the data center industry is low as operator switching costs are very high. Customers often colocate expensive hardware in the facility. Relocating this equipment involves significant time, cost, and risk of downtime. Most data center services (especially colocation and wholesale) are tied to multi-year contracts (typically more than 3 years going up to 10 years), with strong financial and legal disincentives for early termination. The mission critical nature of data centers makes them almost churn proof except when a contingency occurs such as power black outs or natural calamities such as floods or earthquakes that might render a data center inoperable, forcing customers to switch data center colocation.

## VIII. Edge data center capacity

With increasing demand for low-latency services, real-time processing, and localized data storage, Edge data center capability has emerged as a key differentiator among data center operators. Evaluating the Edge data center capability of various players.

## IX. AI readiness and liquid immersion cooling capability

With the exponential rise in high-density AI workloads driven by generative models, machine learning (ML) training, and inferencing, data center operators are rapidly adapting to meet the unique infrastructure demands of AI. Two critical parameters that now differentiate operators are: AI readiness and support for advanced cooling solutions such as Liquid Immersion Cooling (LIC). Below is a summary on AI readiness and
