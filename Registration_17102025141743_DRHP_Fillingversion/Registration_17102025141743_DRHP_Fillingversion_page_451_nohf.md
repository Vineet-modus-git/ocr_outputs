### Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents were ₹266.20 million. Historically, our sources of liquidity have principally been from cash flows from our operations and working capital loans from banks. Our cash requirements have mainly been for working capital. We expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be our principal source of cash. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated regular working capital requirements and partially to meet capital expenditures, for the next 12 months. We obtain long-term facilities from various banks and financial institutions in addition to accessing debt capital market to meet a significant portion of our capital expenditures. We continue to assess our liquidity requirements depending on business growth and market developments and take appropriate actions to manage the liquidity through various sources, internal and external.
