Edge data centers are data centers that are located in close proximity to end-users and enterprise hubs. This physical proximity helps address the challenges created by latency and redundancy, which makes Edge data centers essential to meeting the growing demands of Hyperscaler and Enterprise clients. According to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, with the exponential rise in real-time content consumption through social media, video streaming, and gaming platforms, along with the proliferation of IoT devices across industries, the demand for edge computing is expected to witness a significant surge. Edge data centers are expected to play an important role in meeting this additional demand, as these trends necessitate ultra-low latency and localized data processing, making Edge data centers increasingly vital for ensuring seamless user experiences and timely decision-making, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. As of June 30, 2025, we had 2 Edge data centers under development in Lucknow and Chandigarh."}, {"bbox": [194, 1152, 606, 1189], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Capacity and Capacity Utilization"}, {"bbox": [194, 1213, 1603, 1313], "category": "Text", "text": "The following table sets forth certain information relating to our capacity utilization of our data centers, calculated on the basis of the design capacity, installed capacity and actual utilized capacity for each of the relevant periods, as certified by the Independent Chartered Engineer by way of his certificate, dated October 16, 2025."}]
