### 36. Financial risk management

The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

* Credit risk

* Liquidity risk

* Market risk

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. The Board of Directors has established a risk management policy to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management systems are reviewed periodically to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the risk management framework. The Board of Directors are assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Board of Directors.

#### Credit risk:

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Company's trade receivables, treasury operations and other activities that are in the nature of leases.

#### Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. Management considers that the demographics of the Company's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of the customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of the business.

#### Cash and Bank balances and other investments

In the area of treasury operations, the Company is presently exposed to counter-party risks relating to short term and medium term deposits placed with banks. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for monitoring the counterparty credit risk, and has been vested with the authority to seek Board's approval to hedge such risks in case of need.

#### Exposure to credit risk

The gross carrying amount of financial assets, net of any impairment losses recognized represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk as at June 30, 2025, March 31, 2025, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 was as follows:
