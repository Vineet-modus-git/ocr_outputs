As part of this ambition, the UAE is planning to invest tens of billions of dollars in overseas data centers through bilateral partnerships. With data centers now recognized as essential infrastructure for economic competitiveness and their development requiring high capital and energy inputs, countries are increasingly turning to collaborative models involving both public and private sector investments. Amid regional variations in construction costs, India has emerged as a particularly attractive destination. India's cost advantages, supported by a strong digital growth trajectory, make it a preferred zone for data center investments from Middle Eastern economies looking to expand their global digital footprint."}, {"bbox": [391, 692, 848, 731], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**Upcoming UAE investments in India:**"}, {"bbox": [391, 752, 1602, 854], "category": "Text", "text": "The UAE is advancing multiple bilateral agreements to grow its international data center footprint.

However, this growth is expected to significantly strain the region's energy resources, with data center electricity requirements projected to surge by up to approximately 160% by calendar year 2030, reaching approximately 287 TWh annually, surpassing Spain's total consumption in calendar year 2022. Additionally, if powered by fossil fuels, emissions from new EU data centers could rise from approximately 5MT carbon emissions in calendar year 2025 to approximately 39MT by calendar year 2030, exceeding the combined emissions of Lithuania and Estonia in calendar year 2022. Against this backdrop, India is emerging as an alternative, evident by entry of European cloud provider, OVHCloud, opening a data center in India. With a robust power grid, a deep pool of skilled talent, and cost-efficient infrastructure, India is well-positioned to serve not just domestic demand but also cater to global markets. India's coastal regions offer many advantages for new data centers. Proximity to near-shore wind and solar generation and energy storage facilities can significantly reduce transmission infrastructure costs, energy losses, carbon footprint, and right-of-way land acquisition issues for data centers. The relatively moderate temperature ranges in India's coastal regions could also reduce data centers' energy and water demands. Moreover, as renewable energy projects are modular, they can be rapidly scaled up to match the rate of data center growth. Energy flows can be ring-fenced through the spatial colocation of data centers and the associated power infrastructure, avoiding additional stress on local distribution grids. By tapping into renewable energy sources and integrating energy-efficient technologies, India offers a solution that not only supports data center growth but also alleviates the carbon emission challenges faced by regions like Europe. These advantages position India as a global data center hub amid Europe's energy limitations and APAC's scale constraints."}, {"bbox": [391, 1635, 1602, 1802], "category": "Text", "text": "For example, in calendar year 2023, OVHCloud, one of Europe's leading cloud providers, launched its first data center in Mumbai, marking its entry into the Asia-Pacific region.
