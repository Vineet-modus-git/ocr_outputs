generation data center design, automation, and sustainability practices. GTM strategies targeting hyperscalers must focus on high-capacity, customized infrastructure with global scalability.

**b. Large enterprises:** These are corporations with complex IT needs, often in regulated industries. These customers require customized SLAs, hybrid cloud options, and high availability. GTM strategies must emphasize compliance, security, and bundled managed services.

**c. Small and medium businesses:** This segment includes growing and relatively established companies. They seek cost-effective, scalable services with manageable complexity. Bundled colocation, flexible pricing, and simplified service packages appeal to this group.

**d. Digital startups:** Often early in their infrastructure journey, startups prioritize agility, pay-as-you-go models, quick deployment, and DevOps-ready environments. GTM strategies should focus on API-first integrations and minimal upfront cost.

## II. Segmentation by industry vertical

**a. BFSI:** The BFSI sector prioritizes regulatory compliance, robust data security, and effective disaster recovery solutions to ensure secure and uninterrupted financial operations.

**b. IT/ITeS and SaaS:** The IT/ITeS and SaaS industries emphasize scalable infrastructure, intelligent automation, and seamless multi-cloud connectivity. These capabilities enable rapid growth, efficient service delivery, and flexibility in managing complex workloads.

**c. Media, OTT, Gaming:** This sector demands ultra-low latency, strategically located edge infrastructure, and high data throughput. These factors are vital for real-time content delivery, interactive experiences, and uninterrupted streaming.

**d. Healthcare and Pharma:** The focus is on secure data storage, high system uptime, and adherence to stringent data privacy certifications. These elements ensure patient confidentiality, compliance with health regulations, and continuous access to medical systems.

**e. Government:** Focus on sovereign data hosting within the country and implementation of robust security protocols. These measures help maintain national data sovereignty, protect public sector systems, and support compliance with local governance mandates.

## III. Segmentation by geography

**a. Metro/Tier 1 cities:** These cities demand dense interconnection, direct access to major cloud providers, and robust local edge infrastructure. Such features are crucial to support high data traffic, low-latency services, and the digital needs of large enterprises and tech-driven consumers.

**b. Tier 2/3 Regions:** These regions present strong opportunities for cost-effective edge deployments and partner-led go-to-market strategies. They are increasingly becoming important growth hubs, driven by rising digital adoption and demand for localized infrastructure.

## IV. Segmentation by network availability

**a. Subsea cable proximity zones:** Locations like Mumbai and Chennai offer direct connectivity to international subsea cables. These cities are ideal for high-capacity data center builds due to lower latency for global traffic and robust bandwidth availability. GTM strategies here should focus on hyperscalers, global SaaS players, and content delivery platforms.

**b. Dark fiber zones:** Tier-1 cities with dense fiber backbones and strong dark fiber availability (e.g., Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai) support enterprise workloads and interconnectivity across business districts, IT hubs, and industrial clusters, GTM strategies here should target enterprises (BFSI, IT/ITeS telecoms) and cloud interconnect providers.

By aligning GTM strategies with detailed customer segmentation, providers can create differentiated value propositions, improve customer satisfaction, and drive market success across diverse customer segments.

Across all segments, certain infrastructure and support capabilities are non-negotiable and can act as GTM differentiators:
