RECs represent the environmental attributes of renewable energy generation, allowing companies to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing certificates equivalent to 1 MWh of renewable electricity. By adopting RECs, data centers can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability, even when operating on mixed-source grids. This approach improves their ESG credentials, making them more attractive to environmentally conscious customers. For instance, Infosys purchases RECs from Indian energy exchanges to cover grid electricity consumption not met by its on-site solar plants and direct power agreements, helping it achieve its renewable energy goals."}, {"bbox": [244, 1507, 1557, 1764], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Exchange traded power**\n  Exchange traded power is reshaping data centers' energy procurement by offering flexibility and cost efficiency. Through power exchanges, they can access cheap renewable electricity. In India, data centers increasingly use Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure green energy at competitive rates. This approach optimizes costs and reduces reliance on fossil fuels. For example, Equinix sourced 33 MW of renewable energy from CleanMax for its Mumbai centers.

Intra-state rules govern power within state borders, with some states like Uttar Pradesh offering incentives for renewable energy use, as seen in its 2021 Data Center Policy. Inter-state policies enable electricity procurement from neighboring states via open access, allowing access to lower tariffs or greener sources. This flexibility lowers operational costs and supports expansion in energy-efficient regions. This policy flexibility is also increasingly pertinent as data center infrastructure requirements evolve in response to emerging high-performance and AI-centric workloads. In this context, supportive intra- and inter-state regulations may play a facilitative role in enabling operators to evaluate locations offering scalable, reliable, and cleaner power sources."}, {"bbox": [244, 2139, 1557, 2207], "category": "Text", "text": "India currently has one of the largest shares of renewable energy in its power grid mix, with renewables accounting for 46% of the total installed power capacity as of calendar year 2023.
