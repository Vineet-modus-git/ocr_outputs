[{"bbox": [290, 97, 1603, 1559], "category": "List-item", "text": "*   **Power scarcity challenges:** In India, where power availability and grid reliability vary across regions, the challenge of ensuring consistent energy supply is further amplified. Additionally, high-performance computing generates substantial heat, necessitating advanced cooling solutions such as liquid or immersion cooling. While these technologies are energy-efficient, they demand significant upfront infrastructure investment and remain in the early stages of adoption in the Indian market, largely due to cost sensitivities and climatic factors.\n*   **Sustainability and renewable energy:** Rising energy tariffs and regional grid limitations are significantly increasing data center operating costs in India. In response, operators are adopting energy-efficient infrastructure such as liquid cooling and actively integrating renewable sources like solar and wind. Growing sustainability mandates from both the Indian government and global clients are further pushing the shift toward greener operations and improved Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE).\n*   **Escalating costs:** High-density data centers require specialized infrastructure, such as enhanced power delivery and advanced cooling systems, which significantly elevates capital expenditure during construction or retrofitting. A significant portion of data center costs arises from imported components, particularly in Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) systems and Information Technology (IT) equipment. The union government's proposed data center policy encourages reduction on imports, however sourcing may need to rely on imports since not all components are manufactured in India. The substantial power requirements of high-density data center facilities have driven up electricity costs, leading to higher operating expenses and potential price increases for end-user services.\n*   **Long and complex process of sales to colocation clients:** Poor demand forecasting can result in capacity shortfalls, service disruptions, and revenue loss. Additionally, managing varied client requirements requires a skilled workforce; however, talent shortages in networking, security, and server management pose a significant operational challenge.\n*   **Network connectivity:** Data transfer is highly reliant on the network availability which could be a challenge when traffic exceeds network capacity, causing delays and slow data transmission. These fluctuations or outages might lead to downtime and data loss, requiring robust backup solutions and redundancy.\n*   **Regulatory and land acquisition challenges:** Data center operators are required to manage over 30-40 approvals across multiple ministries and departments via multi-window clearances, causing significant delays in project initiation. Similarly, there are several land sourcing complexities that a data center should comply with. As land is a state subject, acquisition must comply with varied local regulations. Legal clearances and due diligence processes are often prolonged, with land acquisition timelines stretching up to a year or more.\n*   **Statutory and legal compliance challenge:** The central government's data center policy has not yet been finalized and is in the draft stage. However, states like Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have formally introduced a data centers policy that offers benefits and incentives to data center operators. Maharashtra also covers data centers under its IT Policy. All new developments need to obtain statutory approvals from respective authorities such as Environmental Clearance (EC), Consent for Operations (CFO), Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) license, Chief Electrical Inspector to Government (CEIG) as these processes are mandatory and may be lengthy. A key challenge for operators is that setting up data centers across different states requires state-specific approvals which vary in process and timelines, making the procedure complex and time-consuming."}, {"bbox": [290, 1583, 1603, 1747], "category": "Text", "text": "Despite the challenges, India's data center industry continues to evolve steadily, supported by digital growth, data localization mandates, rising cloud adoption, and government-backed digital initiatives. The industry is resilient and is poised for significant expansion, as India continues to experience a gap between its surging data demand and the development of supporting data center infrastructure. With strategic policy support, prudent investment and increasing demand across sectors, the data center ecosystem is overcoming barriers and gaining momentum."}, {"bbox": [191, 1768, 435, 1806], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## 7.
