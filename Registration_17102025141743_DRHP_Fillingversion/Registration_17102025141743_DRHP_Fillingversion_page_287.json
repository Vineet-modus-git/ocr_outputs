We operate 14 colocation data center facilities located in 6 cities with a combined built IT power capacity of 188.04 MW, as of June 30, 2025. According to the 1Lattice and C&W Report, these cities, namely Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Kolkata, are among India's fastest-growing data center clusters, and our presence in these commercial hubs positions us well to capitalize on the existing and emerging demand for our solutions from Hyperscaler and Enterprise clients. Presence in such key demand pockets enables low latency for our data centers, which in turn minimizes transmission delays and ensures faster response times for applications and services, providing a significant benefit to our clients, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. In particular, our data centers in key hub coastal cities, such as Mumbai and Chennai, are in close proximity to international undersea cable landing points, offering low-latency access and strong global connectivity, according to the 1Lattice and C&W Report. For example, the Chennai 02 Data Center has a 2 petabyte capacity subsea data cable landing station on site."}, {"bbox": [193, 539, 1600, 639], "category": "Text", "text": "Our data centers are carrier-neutral and strategically positioned in locations with high network connectivity, including subsea data cable landing stations and fiber networks.
