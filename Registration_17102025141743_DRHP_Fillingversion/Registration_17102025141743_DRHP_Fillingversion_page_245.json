When compared to its Asian peers on a per capita digitalization basis, India still has significant headroom for growth, suggesting strong potential for future digital workloads. Indian internet subscribers stood at approximately 69 per 100 people by the end of calendar year 2024 (which was approximately 67 per 100 people in calendar year 2023) as per TRAI's performance indicator report, compared to China's and Japan's internet penetration of 78% and 83% respectively in calendar year 2023. This considerably lower internet penetration, coupled with the rising digitization push across sectors highlights the vast opportunity India holds in scaling up digital workloads, and by extension, the demand for data centers. Some other factors shaping this demand also include India's low operating costs, rising data localization requirements, and the country's emergence as a potential data embassy hub."}, {"bbox": [192, 848, 931, 888], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 4.1.1 India's data center demand: past, present and future"}, {"bbox": [260, 912, 1452, 1520], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [291, 1598, 1604, 1858], "category": "Text", "text": "India's data center demand is set to grow sharply over the next decade, driven by rising data consumption per user and a rapidly expanding digital population.
