Further, these Non-GAAP measures are not a measurement of our financial performance or liquidity under Ind AS, IFRS or US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to cash flows, profit/ (loss) for the year or any other measure of financial performance or as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities derived in accordance with Ind AS, IFRS or US GAAP. These Non-GAAP financial measures and other information relating to financial performance may not be computed on the basis of any standard methodology that is applicable across the industry and therefore may not be comparable to financial measures of similar nomenclature that may be computed and presented by other companies and are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by Ind AS. Such supplemental financial and operational information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our Restated Consolidated Financial Information disclosed elsewhere in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
