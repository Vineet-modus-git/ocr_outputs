is expected to grow to 1 million by 2026.²⁹ Moreover, India’s median workforce age of 32 years positions it uniquely to meet global digital and data center demands.³⁰

As India positions itself as a key node in the global digital infrastructure network, the availability of AI-skilled talent has become one of its strongest differentiators. With a well-established technology services sector, growing emphasis on upskilling, and increasing global reliance on offshore delivery models, the country offers a deep and expanding talent pool well-suited to meet the evolving demands of AI-led industries, including data centers and digital ecosystem players.

### 2.1.3 Cooling and power correlations and criticality for data centers

In data centers, cooling and power systems are closely linked, as IT power usage directly impacts cooling demand. Efficient, integrated design ensures optimal energy use, lowers costs, and supports sustainability. As server densities rise, coordinated cooling power strategies are essential for maintaining performance and reliability.

#### 2.1.3.1 Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) cooling systems for data centers

HVAC systems play a vital role in data centers by regulating temperature and humidity levels to ensure efficient functioning of IT equipment and prevent overheating. The following are the types of HVAC systems used for data centers:

* **Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units:** Use refrigerants and compressors to cool air in a closed loop, circulating chilled air through raised floors.
* **Computer Room Air Handler (CRAH) units:** Use chilled water from external chillers to cool air, adjusting airflow based on temperature and humidity for efficient performance.
* **Precision Air Conditioning (PAC) units:** Precision Air Conditioning units provide accurate, energy-efficient climate control tailored for the thermal demands of data centers.
* **In-row cooling:** Places cooling units between server racks for targeted, efficient cooling, ideal for high-density setups.
* **Evaporative cooling:** Uses water evaporation to cool air, offering sustainable cooling in dry or moderate climates.
* **Hot/Cold Aisle Containment (HACA):** Enhances cooling efficiency by isolating hot and cold airflows through strategic rack alignment. Cold aisle containment encloses the cold air to ensure direct delivery to servers, while hot aisle containment captures and redirects hot exhaust air to cooling units. This segregation reduces thermal mixing, enhances airflow management, and supports more efficient cooling, especially in high-density setups, ultimately lowering energy use and improving equipment reliability.
