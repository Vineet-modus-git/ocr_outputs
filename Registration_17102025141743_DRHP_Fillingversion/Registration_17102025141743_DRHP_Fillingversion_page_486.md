in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and referred to in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus as “U.S. QIBs”,
for the avoidance of doubt, the term U.S. QIBs does not refer to a category of institutional investor defined under
applicable Indian regulations and referred to in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus as “QIBs”) in private
transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, and (ii) outside the United States
in offshore transactions as defined in and in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act and the
applicable laws of the jurisdiction where those offers and sales occur.

The Equity Shares have not been and will not be registered, listed or otherwise qualified in any other jurisdiction outside India and may not be offered or sold, and Bids may not be made by persons in any such jurisdiction except in compliance with the applicable laws of such jurisdiction.

Until the expiry of 40 days after the commencement of the Offer, an offer or sale of Equity Shares within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offer) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act unless made pursuant to Rule 144A or another available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and in accordance with applicable state securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States. The Equity Shares have not been recommended by any U.S. federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority. Furthermore, the foregoing authorities have not confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus or approved or disapproved the Equity Shares. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States. In making an investment decision investors must rely on their own examination of our Company and the terms of the Offer, including the merits and risks involved.

(i) in the United States to investors that are U.S. QIBs in private transactions exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act; and

and in each case who are deemed to have made the representations set forth immediately below.
