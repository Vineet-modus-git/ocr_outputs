Revenue from operations is not linear in nature and depends on our ability to bring new IT power capacity online and our clients taking up such IT power capacity. Typically, it takes us between two and three years to bring a data center to full capacity allocation, subject to client demand. We generally enter into fixed-price, fixed-term contracts with our clients. The performance obligations are satisfied over time. Service revenue is recognized as the related services are performed.
