promises in the contract and if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer.

The Company allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Standalone selling price is the price at which Company would sell a promised good or service separately to the customer.

If the relative stand-alone selling prices are not available, the Company estimates the same. In doing so, the Company maximise the use of observable inputs and apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.

### Contract Cost

Costs to fulfil customer contracts i.e the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the Company can specifically identify or the costs generate/ enhance resources of the company that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future or the costs that are expected to be recovered are recognised as asset and amortized over the contract period.

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are recognised as assets and amortized over the contract period if entity expects to recover those costs. The Company recognise incremental cost of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognised is one year or less.

Costs to obtain a contract that is incurred regardless of whether the contract is obtained are recognised as an expense when incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether the contract is obtained.

### Significant judgements on applying Ind AS 115

The Company contracts with customer include promises or arrangements to transfer multiple goods or services to a customer. The Company assess whether such arrangements in the contract has distinct goods or services (performance obligation). Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgment to determine ability of customer to benefit independently from other promises in the contract.

The judgment is required to measure the transaction price for the contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised

goods or services to a customer. The consideration could be fixed amount or variable amount or could be both. Transaction price could also be adjusted for time value of money if contract includes a significant financing component.

In the case of multiple arrangements in a contract, the Company allocate transaction price to each performance obligation based on standalone transaction price. The determination of standalone transaction price involves judgment.

The Company uses judgment in determining timing of satisfaction of performance obligation. The Company considers how customer benefits from goods or services as the services are rendered, who controls as the assets is created or enhanced, whether asset has an alternate use and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, transfer of significant risk and reward to the customer, acceptance or sign off from the customer etc.,

The Company uses judgement when capitalising the contract cost as to whether it generates or enhances resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying performance obligation in the future.
