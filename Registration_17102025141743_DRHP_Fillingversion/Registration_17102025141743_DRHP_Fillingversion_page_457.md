arising on such translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. Such differences are included in the foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR") within other components of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed off, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to profit or loss.

## Financial Instruments

### (a) Financial Assets

Financial assets comprises investments in equity and debt securities, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets.

#### Initial Recognition

All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value except trade receivables. In the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

#### Subsequent Measurement

##### (i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost:

Financial assets held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cashflows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortized cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortization is recognized as finance income in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss.

The Company while applying above criteria has classified the following financial assets at amortized cost: (i) trade receivable and (ii) other financial assets.

##### (ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI"):

Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are subsequently measured at FVTOCI. Fair value movements in financial assets at FVTOCI are recognized in other comprehensive income.

Equity instruments held for trading are classified as at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"). For other equity instruments the company classifies the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. Fair value changes on equity investments at FVTOCI, excluding dividends, are recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI").

##### (iii) Financial assets at FVTPL:

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss if it does not meet the criteria for classification as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. All fair value changes are recognized in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss.

#### Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the financial asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) shall be recognized in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss.

#### Impairment of financial assets

Trade receivables, contract assets, lease receivables under Ind AS 109, investments in debt instruments that are carried at amortized cost, investments in debt instruments that are carried at FVTOCI are tested for impairment based on the expected credit losses for the respective financial asset.

##### (i) Trade receivables

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date. The expected credit losses over lifetime of the asset are estimated by adopting the simplified approach using a provision matrix which is based on
