While these powerhouse markets continue to rapidly add new capacity, other markets are also experiencing growth.\n* **ESTABLISHED** markets—Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Melbourne, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur—have already created a strong foothold in the region, with most operators viewing these markets as strategically important for expansions. Together, these markets account for 22% of the region's built capacity and 25% of the development pipeline.\n* **DEVELOPING** markets—Osaka, Bangkok, Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, Pune, and Guangzhou—may have comparatively smaller live capacities, but they are seen as markets for future growth. The average capacity for this group of cities as of March 31, 2025 is 153 MW, accounting for only 7% of the built capacity.\n* **EMERGING** markets—Busan, Auckland, Taipei, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth, Bengaluru, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Batam—these 11 markets have a combined share in built capacity of 4-5% as of March 31, 2025."}, {"bbox": [193, 1533, 1003, 1569], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## 3.2 India's growing presence in the global data center industry"}, {"bbox": [294, 1594, 1602, 1885], "category": "Text", "text": "India's data center industry remains in an emerging stage when benchmarked against global leaders. The United States of America, for instance, has a built capacity of nearly 18 times greater than that of India, while China's capacity is approximately 3.5 times larger. This significant gap highlights the substantial runway for growth in India's data center market. Currently, India aligns more closely with the third tier of global markets—those with built capacities in the range of 1.3 to 1.6 GW—alongside countries such as Japan, Australia, and Canada. India's under-construction and planned data center capacity over the next five years stands at approximately 2.7 GW with investments up to USD 20 billion,⁴⁹ underscoring sustained investor confidence in the country's long-term data center growth trajectory. With the Indian data center market maturing, the promising investment potential and attractive returns are prompting investors to commit significant capital towards acquiring data center assets across the region."}, {"bbox": [294, 2047, 830, 2068], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "Cushman & Wakefield Investment Landscape Jun-2025 APAC Regional Content Data Centres"}]
