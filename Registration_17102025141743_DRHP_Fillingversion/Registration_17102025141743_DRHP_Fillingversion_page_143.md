5. Weighted average number of Equity Shares is the number of Equity Shares outstanding at the beginning of the year/ period adjusted by the number of Equity Shares issued during the year multiplied by the time weighting factor. The time weighting factor is the number of days for which the specific shares are outstanding as a proportion of total number of days during the year/ period.
