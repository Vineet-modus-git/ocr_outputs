Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial information at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization at the end of each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of fair value hierarchy.

Fair values have been determined for measurement and / or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

### Investments in equity and debt securities

The fair value is determined by reference to their quoted price at the reporting date. In the absence of quoted price, the fair value of the financial asset is measured using valuation techniques.

### Trade and other receivables

The fair value of trade and other receivables expected to be realized beyond twelve months, excluding construction contracts in progress, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. However in respect of such financial instruments, fair value generally approximates the carrying amount due to the short term nature of such assets. This fair value is determined for disclosure purposes or when acquired in a business combination.

### Derivatives

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their quoted price, if available. If a quoted price is not available, the fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract. Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Company and the counter party when appropriate. The fair value of the cross-currency swaps (principal only swaps) and interest rate swaps is determined based on the discounting of the future cash flows at the market rates existing on the reporting date.

### Non derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.

### Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes method. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), expected term of the instrument (based on historical experience and general option holder behavior), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds).

### Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates

Investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses if any.

### Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Company's cash management.
