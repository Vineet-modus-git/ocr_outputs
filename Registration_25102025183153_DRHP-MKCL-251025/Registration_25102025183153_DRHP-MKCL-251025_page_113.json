Ratcheting up a trade war, along with even more elevated trade policy uncertainty, could further reduce near- and long-term growth, while eroded policy buffers weaken resilience to future shocks. Divergent and rapidly shifting policy stances or deteriorating sentiment could trigger additional repricing of assets beyond what took place after the announcement of sweeping US tariffs on April 2 and sharp adjustments in foreign exchange rates and capital flows, especially for economies already facing debt distress. Broader financial instability may ensue, including damage to the international monetary system. Demographic shifts and a shrinking foreign labor force may curb potential growth and threaten fiscal sustainability. The lingering effects of the recent cost-of-living crisis, coupled with depleted policy space and dim medium-term growth prospects, could reignite social unrest. The resilience shown by many large emerging market economies may be tested as servicing high debt levels becomes more challenging in unfavorable global financial conditions. More limited international development assistance may increase the pressure on low-income countries, pushing them deeper into debt or necessitating significant fiscal adjustments, with immediate consequences for growth and living standards. On the upside, a de-escalation from current tariff rates and new agreements providing clarity and stability in trade policies could lift global growth. The global economy is at a critical juncture. Signs of stabilization were emerging through much of 2024, after a prolonged and challenging period of unprecedented shocks. Inflation, down from multi decade highs, followed a gradual though bumpy decline toward central bank targets (Figure 1.1)."}, {"bbox": [95, 889, 1557, 962], "category": "Text", "text": "Labor markets normalized, with unemployment and vacancy rates returning to pre-pandemic levels (Figure 1.2).

High-frequency indicators such as retail sales and purchasing managers' surveys point to slowing growth. In the United States, consumer, business, and investor sentiment was optimistic at the beginning of the year but has recently shifted to a notably more pessimistic stance as uncertainty has taken hold and new tariffs have been announced. In labor markets, hiring has slowed in many countries, and layoffs have risen. Meanwhile, progress on disinflation has mostly stalled, and inflation has edged upward in some cases, with an increasing number of countries exceeding their inflation targets. Services inflation, though still on a downward trend, remains above levels prior to the inflation surge, and core goods inflation has seen an uptick since November 2024. Trade has held up, but this is mostly because of an increase in Chinese exports and US imports at the end of 2024, with consumers and businesses likely front-loading ahead of tariffs that were anticipated back then and now are in place."}, {"bbox": [112, 1353, 671, 1405], "category": "Caption", "text": "**Figure 1.3.** Growth Performance and Forecasts\n(Percent)"}, {"bbox": [109, 1423, 832, 2014], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [112, 2033, 773, 2106], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: IMF staff calculations.\nNote: AEs = advanced economies; EMDEs = emerging market and developing economies."}, {"bbox": [849, 1337, 1159, 1383], "category": "Caption", "text": "**Figure 1.2.** Labor Markets\n(Percent)"}, {"bbox": [849, 1396, 1553, 1892], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [849, 1906, 1549, 1979], "category": "Text", "text": "Sources: Haver Analytics; India Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Periodic Labour Force Survey; International Labour Organization; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; US Bureau of Economic Analysis; US Bureau of Labor Statistics; and IMF staff calculations."}, {"bbox": [849, 1979, 1549, 2136], "category": "Text", "text": "Note: In panel 1, India's unemployment in urban areas is from Periodic Labour Force Survey data.
