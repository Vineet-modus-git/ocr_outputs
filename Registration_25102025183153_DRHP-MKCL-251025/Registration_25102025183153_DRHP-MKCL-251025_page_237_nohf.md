Previously, value addition was limited to minor cloth processing. With end-to-end manufacturing, the company now oversees the complete value addition cycle, from yarn to finished cloth that enhancing product quality, expanding its product portfolio, and improving margins.<br>To support higher production volumes and achieve economies of scale, we undertook a significant capacity expansion through targeted capital expenditures of ₹1,342 lakhs, including ₹627 lakhs in Capital Work in Progress of FY 24. As a result, annual installed capacity doubled from 37.5 lakh KGS in FY 2023-24 to 75 lakh KGS in FY 2024-25. Capacity utilization in FY 2024-25 stood at 64.5%, compared to 80.2% in the previous year, reflecting the ramp-up of new capacity. This expansion enabled a strategic focus on value-added, high-margin product, including knitted Fabric, which now constitute a larger portion of our sales mix.<br>The table below summarizes our capital expenditure (Capex) over the past years</td><td>Revenue from operations increased by 21.33%, from ₹8,932.70 lakhs in FY 2023 to ₹10,838.45 lakhs in FY 2024.<br><strong>Reason for increase in Revenue in FY 24 as compared to FY 23</strong><br><em>Shifting Towards End-to-End Manufacturing</em><br>The company is in the process of integrating end-to-end manufacturing, a strategy aimed at capturing higher value and enhancing operational efficiency. During the initial phase, growth was primarily driven by increased market demand for fabrics. At this stage, the company was still developing its fully integrated capabilities and primarily engaged in the production of semi-processed fabrics. Despite operating with a partially integrated setup, the company successfully leveraged market opportunities, scaled up sales volumes, and achieved a healthy year-over-year increase in revenue.<br>This strategic shift was supported by an increase in annual installed capacity from 24 lakh KGS in FY 2022-23 to 37.5 lakh KGS in FY 2023-24, with capacity utilization rising to 80.2%. Capital expenditures of ₹3.05 crores during the year enabled this expansion, laying the foundation for scalable growth and higher-margin production.<br>The table below summarizes our capital expenditure (Capex) over the past years</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><table><thead><tr><th>Financial Year</th><th>Annual Installed Capacity in KGS</th><th>Annual Utilised Capacity in KGS</th><th>Capacity (%)</th><th>Capex during the year in INR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2023-2024</td><td>37,50,000</td><td>30,07,564</td><td>80.2</td><td>3,05,06,419</td></tr><tr><td>2024-2025</td><td>75,00,000</td><td>48,38,190</td><td>64.5</td><td>10,81,20,840</td></tr></tbody></table><em>The capacity utilization is based on the certificate issued by a Chartered Engineer, dated July 21, 2025</em></td><td><table><thead><tr><th>Financial Year</th><th>Annual Installed Capacity in KGS</th><th>Annual Utilised Capacity in KGS</th><th>Capacity (%)</th><th>Capex during the year in INR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2022-2023</td><td>24,00,000</td><td>18,94,542</td><td>78.9</td><td>93,59,031</td></tr><tr><td>2023-2024</td><td>37,50,000</td><td>30,07,564</td><td>80.2</td><td>3,05,06,419</td></tr></tbody></table><em>The capacity utilization is based on the certificate issued by a Chartered Engineer, dated July 21, 2025</em></td></tr><tr><td>Other Income</td><td>Other income increased by 492.45%, from ₹2.12 lakhs in FY 2024 to ₹12.56 lakhs in FY 2025.</td><td>Other income decreased by 90.78%, from ₹23.05 lakhs in FY 2023 to ₹2.12 lakhs in FY 2024.</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of Material Consumed</td><td>Cost of materials consumed increased by 49.86%, from ₹8,112.04 lakhs in FY 2024 to ₹12,156.02 lakhs in FY 2025.</td><td>Cost of materials consumed increased by 26.51%, from ₹6,412.48 lakhs in FY 2023 to ₹8,112.04 lakhs in FY 2024.</td></tr></tbody></table>
