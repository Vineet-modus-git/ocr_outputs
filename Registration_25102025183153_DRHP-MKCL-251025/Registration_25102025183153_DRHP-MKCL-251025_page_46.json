[{"bbox": [94, 144, 1559, 524], "category": "Text", "text": "Under current Indian tax laws and regulations, capital gains arising from the sale of Equity Shares in an Indian Company are generally taxable in India. Any gain realized on the sale of listed Equity Shares on a stock exchange held for more than 12 months shall be subject to capital gains tax in India at 10% of such capital gain exceeding Rs. 1 lakh if Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been paid on both acquisition and transfer of such shares. STT will be levied on and collected by a domestic stock exchange on which the Equity Shares are sold. Any gain realised on the sale of Equity Shares held for more than 12 months to an Indian resident, which are sold other than on a recognized stock exchange and on which no STT has been paid, will be subject to long term capital gains tax in India. However, any gain realized on the sale of listed Equity Shares held for a period of 12 months or less will be subject to short term capital gains tax in India. Further, any gain realised on the sale of listed equity shares held for a period of 12 months or less which are sold other than on a recognised stock exchange and on which no STT has been paid, will be subject to short term capital gains tax at a relatively higher rate as compared to the transaction where STT has been paid in India.

The market price of a company's share is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the stock market. These forces are influenced by a variety of factors, including the company's financial performance, industry trends, economic conditions, and investor sentiment. When a company issues equity shares, it sets an issue price based on various factors such as the company's valuation, the prevailing market conditions, and the demand for its shares. However, the issue price is not necessarily indicative of the market price of the shares after the issue. Once the shares are listed on the stock exchange, their price is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the market. If there is strong demand for the shares, the price may rise above the issue price, and if there is weak demand, the price may fall below the issue price. Therefore, while the issue price of equity shares provides a starting point for the company's valuation, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the market price of the shares after the issue.
