**Intellectual Property Laws**

***Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act)***

The Information Technology Act, 2000 provides a legal framework for electronic governance, digital signatures, and online transactions in India. It recognizes electronic records and digital signatures as legally valid, facilitating paperless communication and e-commerce. The Act prescribes penalties for unauthorized access, hacking, data theft, identity theft, and cyber fraud. It also empowers the government to regulate intermediaries, issue directions for blocking websites, and ensure cybersecurity. Amendments, including the IT (Amendment) Act, 2008, further strengthened provisions against cybercrime and introduced liability for intermediaries to maintain due diligence in preventing illegal content dissemination.

***Indian Patents Act, 1970***

The Patents Act, 1970 governs the granting of patents for inventions in India. It protects new and useful inventions by giving inventors exclusive rights to make, use, and sell their inventions for a specific period (currently 20 years from the filing date). The Act specifies criteria for patentability — novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability — and excludes certain inventions (like atomic energy, traditional knowledge, or methods of agriculture). The Act also balances patent protection with public interest by incorporating provisions for compulsory licensing to ensure access to essential goods such as medicines during public health crises. Amendments aligned the Act with TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) standards, making India's patent regime globally compliant.

***Trademarks Act, 1999***

The Trade Marks Act, 1999 regulates the registration, protection, and enforcement of trademarks in India. A trademark is any sign, logo, brand name, word, phrase, or symbol that distinguishes goods or services of one entity from others. The Act provides exclusive rights to trademark owners to use and license their marks, preventing misuse or infringement by unauthorized parties. It also recognizes service marks, collective marks, and certification marks, expanding the scope beyond traditional goods. The Act established the Trademark Registry and provides remedies for infringement through civil and criminal actions, including injunctions, damages, and penalties. Amendments have introduced online filing and simplified procedures to encourage IP protection.
