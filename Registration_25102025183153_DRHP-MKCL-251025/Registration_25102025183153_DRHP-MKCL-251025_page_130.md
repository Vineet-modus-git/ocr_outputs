Our Company markets its products and services through a combination of direct customer engagement, participation in established distribution networks, and long-term relationships with institutional buyers and intermediaries. Its sales approach is structured to address both consumer and industrial textile markets. Consumer-facing products such as blankets and winter wear are marketed primarily through wholesalers, distributors, and retailers located across key textile markets in India, while industrial and technical textiles are marketed to specialized customers through direct channels.

Our Company maintains a customer acquisition model based on repeat orders, customer references, and established networks in Ludhiana and other textile clusters. Marketing activities are supported by product samples, participation in trade exhibitions, and regular interactions with distributors and industrial clients to demonstrate product quality and performance.

For job work services, our Company markets its spare production capacity to third-party textile companies seeking cost-efficient outsourcing of processes such as dyeing, knitting, or finishing. This is facilitated by word-of-mouth referrals, existing customer relationships, and proximity to other textile businesses in Ludhiana.

Our Company's location enables regular physical interaction with customers, timely delivery, and alignment with seasonal demand cycles, thereby integrating marketing activities with operational and logistical strengths.
