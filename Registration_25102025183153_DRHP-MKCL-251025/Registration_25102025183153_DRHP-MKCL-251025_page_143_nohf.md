This process is a deeper brushing step that lifts and fluffs up the fibers even further, increasing thickness, warmth, and a plush feel. It gives the blanket its cozy, luxurious texture.

### Step 10: Polycut

During this stage, any unwanted polyester filaments or threads are precisely trimmed using blade machines. This step ensures the fabric looks clean and finished before the final touches.

### Step 11: Polishing

A final polishing process smoothens the fabric further, enhancing its sheen, softness, and overall aesthetic appeal. This improves the blanket's appearance and visual finish.

### Step 12: Brushing (Final Touch)

Another light brushing gives the fabric a uniform surface feel and adds extra softness. This step helps in achieving consistency in quality for consumer blankets.

### Step 13: Piece Cutting

The polished and brushed fabric is now cut into specific sizes based on product requirements (single, double, king-size blankets, etc.) using precision cutting equipment.

### Step 14: Stitching of Rib (Edge Finishing)

The edges of the cut pieces are finished with rib stitching or binding, usually with a contrasting or matching fabric strip. This not only enhances the appearance but also prevents fraying and increases durability.

### Step 15: Packing

The finished blankets are carefully folded, quality-checked, labeled, and packed as per customer specifications (folded flat, rolled, vacuum-sealed, etc.) before being dispatched for delivery.
