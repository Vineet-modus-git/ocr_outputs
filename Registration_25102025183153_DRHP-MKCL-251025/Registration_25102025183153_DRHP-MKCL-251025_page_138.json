Rather than relying on a single vendor, we have established a diversified supplier base, which enhances our operational resilience, especially during peak production periods. This multi-supplier model also strengthens our bargaining position and allows for flexible procurement volumes based on order flow."}, {"bbox": [97, 1230, 1555, 1401], "category": "Text", "text": "To further optimize resource utilization, our procurement strategy is closely aligned with an order-based production system.

By integrating procurement planning with production schedules, we are able to maintain tight control over input costs while supporting our Company's broader goals of financial discipline and operational agility."}, {"bbox": [132, 1467, 295, 1555], "category": "Text", "text": "Order-Based Requirement Identification"}, {"bbox": [385, 1482, 547, 1539], "category": "Text", "text": "Supplier Coordination"}, {"bbox": [650, 1482, 789, 1539], "category": "Text", "text": "Quality Assessment"}, {"bbox": [876, 1482, 1071, 1539], "category": "Text", "text": "Purchase Order Placement"}, {"bbox": [1157, 1467, 1295, 1555], "category": "Text", "text": "Inbound Logistics & Delivery"}, {"bbox": [1406, 1482, 1551, 1539], "category": "Text", "text": "Material Verification"}, {"bbox": [97, 1627, 609, 1660], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 1.
