The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code, 2019 consolidates and rationalizes 13 existing laws relating to workplace safety, health standards, and working conditions. It seeks to ensure safe, healthy, and humane working environments for employees in factories, mines, docks, plantations, and other establishments. The Code specifies employer obligations regarding health checkups, working hours, leave policies, and safety equipment. It also provides for licensing of contractors, mandatory registration of establishments, and better protection for inter-state migrant workers. By streamlining regulatory compliance, the Code aims to improve employee welfare and productivity while reducing overlapping provisions.

### Industrial Relations Code, 2020

The Industrial Relations Code, 2020 integrates and replaces three key laws â€” the Trade Unions Act, 1926; the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946; and the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Code seeks to promote harmony between employers and workers by providing a clear legal framework for collective bargaining, resolution of industrial disputes, and conditions for strikes and lockouts. It introduces provisions for fixed-term employment, reduces the threshold for standing orders, and requires industrial establishments above a specified size to seek government approval before lay-offs, retrenchments, or closures. The Code also encourages dispute resolution through conciliation and arbitration to maintain industrial peace.

### Code on Social Security, 2020

The Code on Social Security, 2020 consolidates nine central labour laws relating to social security, such as the Employees' Provident Fund Act, Employees' State Insurance Act, and the Payment of Gratuity Act. It aims to extend social security benefits, including provident fund, insurance, maternity benefits, gratuity, and pension, to all employees and workers, including those in the unorganized and gig economy sectors. The Code mandates the creation of social security funds and allows aggregation of contributions from multiple sources. It also streamlines registration processes and compliance for employers while safeguarding employee welfare through broader coverage and digitized systems.

### Foreign Investment Laws

#### Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992

The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 (FTDR Act) provides the legal framework for regulating and promoting foreign trade in India. It empowers the Central Government to make policies for facilitating imports and increasing exports to ensure balanced trade and economic growth. The Act authorizes the government to issue or regulate Importer-Exporter Codes (IECs), impose restrictions or prohibitions on trade of certain goods, and enforce compliance with trade regulations. It also enables the government to take corrective action against unfair trade practices, protect domestic industries, and maintain foreign exchange reserves.

#### Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) and Rules

The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) replaces the earlier Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) to provide a liberalized and transparent framework for managing foreign exchange in India. FEMA facilitates external trade, cross-border payments, and orderly development of the foreign exchange market. It regulates current account and capital account transactions, overseas investments, foreign borrowings, and remittances by individuals and corporates. The Act empowers the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to issue rules, directions, and approvals, while violations are treated as civil offenses rather than criminal acts, fostering a more business-friendly environment.

#### Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA)

The COFEPOSA Act, 1974 is aimed at conserving foreign exchange and preventing smuggling activities that adversely affect India's economy. The Act authorizes preventive detention of individuals suspected of engaging in smuggling or activities that could deplete foreign exchange reserves. While FEMA handles foreign exchange regulation through civil mechanisms, COFEPOSA provides a deterrent for serious economic offenses by allowing the government to detain offenders without trial for a limited period to safeguard national economic interests.

#### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policies

India's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policies are framed by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). These policies determine the sectors in which foreign investment is permitted, under either the automatic route (no prior government approval required) or the government route (approval required). FDI policies also prescribe sectoral caps, entry conditions, and compliance requirements to ensure that foreign investments align with India's economic and security interests while promoting technology transfer, employment generation, and overall economic growth.
