Further, there is no outstanding litigation involving our Company, Directors and Promoters which is so major that our Company's survival is dependent on the outcome of such pending litigation.

For further details, please refer to chapter titled "Outstanding Litigations & Material Developments" on page 243 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

While our management believes it has valid claims and adequate defenses in these cases, the outcome of such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Any unfavorable ruling, delay in recovery of dues, or imposition of additional liabilities may adversely affect our cash flows, profitability, and reputation. Further, defending or pursuing these matters involves costs, management time, and diversion of resources, which could impact our operations.

**23. Strikes, Work stoppages or increased wage demands by our employees or any other kind of disputes with our employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.**

Our Company is exposed to strikes and other industrial actions. As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Company has 174 full-time employees including KMP and Directors. For further details please refer to chapter "Our Business" on page 123 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. At present, we enjoy a good relationship with our employees. However, there can be no assurance that we may not experience disruptions in our operations due to disputes or other problems with our work force such as strikes, work stoppages or increased wage demands that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Although, there have been no material events relating to this risk factor as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there can be no assurance that such events may not occur in the future.

**24. Changes in Technology may render our current technologies obsolete or require us to make substantial capital investments.**

Modernisation and technology Upgradation is essential in our industry to reduce costs and increase productivity. With latest technology and advancement of methods and machineries, our existing technology and machineries may become obsolete or may not be upgraded timely, hampering our operations and financial conditions and we may lose our competitive edge. Although we strive to keep our technology, plant and machinery in line with the latest technological standards, we may be required to implement new technology or upgrade the machineries and other equipment's employed by us. Further, the costs in upgrading our technology and modernizing the plant and machineries are significant which could substantially affect our finances and operations. For further details please refer to chapter "Our Business-Capacity Utilisation" on page no 123 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
