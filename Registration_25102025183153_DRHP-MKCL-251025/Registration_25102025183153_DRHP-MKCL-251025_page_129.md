## E. Key markets that our company caters to

Our Company caters to end consumers with products such as blankets and winter textiles, providing high-quality, durable, and comfortable fabrics. It also supplies knitted fabrics suitable for apparel, fashion, and home textile segments, targeting retailers, wholesalers, and direct-to-consumer channels.

Madhur Knit Crafts serves industrial enterprises, manufacturers, and other institutional clients requiring customized textile solutions. Following a made-to-order production strategy, the Company initiates manufacturing only upon receipt of confirmed customer orders. This approach minimizes overproduction, avoids excess inventory, and ensures efficient use of raw materials. By aligning procurement and production with actual market demand, the Company optimizes working capital deployment, achieves high resource utilization, and maintains better financial control, particularly during peak or seasonal cycles, while consistently meeting specific quality and design requirements for its clients.

While primarily focused on the domestic Indian market, our Company leverages Ludhiana's status as a textile hub to ensure efficient supply chain management, reliable procurement of raw materials, and seamless distribution across the country.
