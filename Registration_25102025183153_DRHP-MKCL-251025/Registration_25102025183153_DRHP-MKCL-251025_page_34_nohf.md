Meeting these requirements depends on the timely realization of receivables, availability of cash, and access to financing. Inability to manage working capital efficiently may necessitate additional funding, which could be costly and adversely affect our profitability and operational flexibility. Moreover, any shortage of working capital could limit our ability to procure raw materials, produce goods, or fulfill customer orders, thereby materially impacting our business operations.

We currently fund our working capital requirements through a combination of borrowings, and internal accruals. Any constraints in these funding sources, or an increase in working capital needs beyond our projections, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

## 14. Potential conflicts of interest with our Group Company may affect our business.

Our Group Company, Star Cottex Limited, is engaged in the manufacturing and trading of certain products similar to those offered by our Company. This may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in allocating business opportunities or in situations where our respective interests diverge, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The businesses of both companies have evolved independently, based on market opportunities, promoter initiatives, and their specific focus areas. While there is some similarity in the line of business, each company operates with distinct strategies, target markets, customer bases, and product segments, reducing the likelihood of significant overlap.

Nonetheless, situations of conflict may arise concerning business opportunities, customers, suppliers, or use of resources, as both companies operate in related sectors. The Company confirms that it will adopt appropriate measures permitted by law, including adherence to corporate governance requirements, arm's length dealings, and transparent business practices, to mitigate potential conflicts and safeguard the interests of our shareholders while engaging with Star Cottex Limited.

Although, there have been no material events relating to this risk factor as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there can be no assurance that such events may not occur in the future.

## 15. We rely on both in-house logistics and third-party logistics providers, and any disruption or increase in transportation costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our logistics team arranges transportation of products using a combination of in-house vehicles and third-party logistics providers to ensure timely delivery, with tracking shared with customers where applicable. However, we do not have formal long-term arrangements with most third-party providers, which exposes us to fluctuations in transportation costs and availability. If third-party providers receive more favorable terms from our competitors, they may decline to provide services to us or terminate existing arrangements. Additionally, transport strikes, regulatory restrictions, or other disruptions in the logistics network could adversely affect our delivery schedules.

In the event that we are unable to secure alternate logistics arrangements in a timely manner, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, our ability to deliver products efficiently may be impacted, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Although, there have been no material events relating to this risk factor as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there can be no assurance that such events may not occur in the future.

## 16. We require certain approvals, licenses, registrations and permits for our business, and the failure to obtain or renew them in a timely manner may adversely affect our operations.

In future, we shall be required to renew such registrations and approvals and obtain new registrations and approvals for any proposed operations, including any expansion of existing operations. While we believe that we will be able to renew or obtain such registrations and approvals, as and when required, there can be no assurance that the relevant authorities will renew or issue any such registrations or
