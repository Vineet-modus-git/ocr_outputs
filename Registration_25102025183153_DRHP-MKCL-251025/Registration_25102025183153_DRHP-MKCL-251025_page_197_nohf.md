17 Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is :

(i) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or

(ii) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

a.) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or

b.) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
