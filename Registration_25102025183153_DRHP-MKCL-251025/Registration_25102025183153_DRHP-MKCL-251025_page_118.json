Net FPI inflows touched USD 1.7 billion in 2024–25, driven by debt inflows despite equity outflows.\n* **Healthy Forex Reserves:** As of April 4, 2025, India's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD 676.3 billion, offering an import cover of nearly 11 months and reflecting the strength of the external sector."}, {"bbox": [96, 704, 616, 739], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Liquidity and Financial Market Conditions"}, {"bbox": [96, 772, 1559, 1264], "category": "List-item", "text": "* **Liquidity Shortage and RBI Intervention:** In January 2025, the banking system faced a shortage of funds, known as a liquidity deficit. To address this, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provided up to ₹3.1 lakh crore on 23rd January through the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) – a tool that allows banks to borrow money from the RBI for short periods to manage temporary mismatches in cash flow.\n* **Improved Liquidity Position:** The RBI later infused about ₹6.9 lakh crore into the system, and increased government spending in late March helped further. These actions improved the situation, and by 7th April 2025, the system had a liquidity surplus of ₹1.5 lakh crore – meaning there was more money available in banks for lending and investment.\n* **Softening of Market Rates:** With more liquidity available, the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) – the average interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight – declined and hovered close to the repo rate, which is the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks. This indicates stable short-term borrowing costs.\n* **Lower Funding Costs in Debt Market:** The difference between interest rates on Commercial Papers (CPs) and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) – short-term borrowing instruments used by companies and banks – and the 91-day Treasury Bill – a short-term government security – reduced. This narrowing of spreads means that borrowing became cheaper in financial markets.
