**OUR COMPANY HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY INVESTOR COMPLAINTS DURING THE PRECEDING THREE YEARS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE WERE NO INVESTOR COMPLAINTS DISPOSED OF OR PENDING AS ON THE DATE OF FILING THIS DRAFT OFFER DOCUMENT. FURTHER, AS OUR COMPANY HAS NO LISTED GROUP COMPANIES, THE REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE INVESTOR COMPLAINTS IN RESPECT OF THE FIVE LARGEST LISTED GROUP COMPANIES IS NOT APPLICABLE. THE QUESTION OF TIME TAKEN BY THE COMPANY FOR DISPOSAL OF INVESTOR GRIEVANCES DOES NOT ARISE.**

We do not have any listed company under the same management.

**Disposal of investor grievances by the company**

Our Company or the Registrar to the Issue or the SCSB in case of ASBA Applicant shall redress routine investor grievances. We estimate that the average time required by us or the Registrar to this Issue for the redressal of routine investor grievances will be 12 Working Days from the date of receipt of the complaint. In case of non-routine complaints and complaints where external agencies are involved, we will seek to redress these complaints as expeditiously as possible.
