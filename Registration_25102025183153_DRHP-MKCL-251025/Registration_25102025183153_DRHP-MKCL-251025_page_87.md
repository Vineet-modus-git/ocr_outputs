## Introduction

Our Company proposes to allocate a portion of the Net Proceeds, amounting to ₹400.00 lakhs, towards the installation of rooftop solar power plant at our existing manufacturing facilities. This investment is aimed at reducing electricity costs, promoting sustainability, and improving long-term efficiency.

Proposed solar installation will have a capacity of approximately 1500 KW and will be connected to the main electricity grid. This arrangement will enable us to directly utilize the solar power generated, while any surplus electricity beyond our consumption will be fed back into the grid, thereby reducing our electricity bills. The plant will be equipped with high-efficiency mono half-cut bifacial solar modules, based on N-Type Topcon technology, which enhances performance, durability, and overall energy yield by capturing both direct and reflected sunlight.

The installations will also comprise inverters for converting solar energy into usable electricity, mounting structures to support the panels, and comprehensive safety equipment, including DCDB/ACDB boxes to regulate power flow, earthing systems to prevent electrical hazards, and lightning protection devices.

Plant is expected to generate approximately 1,68,750 to 1,80,000 units of electricity per month, as per the supplier quotations. This generation is projected to result in monthly savings of ₹11.81 lakhs to ₹12.60 lakhs, significantly reducing dependence on traditional grid power and lowering operating costs.

The project will be implemented on a turnkey basis, wherein the contractor will be responsible for the design, supply, installation, testing, and handover of fully operational plants. Plant will span an area of 84000 sq.ft. and will be backed by performance warranties covering both solar modules and inverters to ensure long-term reliability.

Beyond financial benefits, these projects will substantially reduce our carbon footprint, reinforcing our alignment with global sustainability goals.
