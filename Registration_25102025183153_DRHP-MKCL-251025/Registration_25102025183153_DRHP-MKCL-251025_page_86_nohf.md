*The requirements of the objects detailed above are intended to be funded from the proceeds of the Issue. Accordingly, we confirm that there is no requirement for us to make firm arrangements of finance through verifiable means towards at least 75% of the stated means of finance, excluding the amount to be raised from the proposed Issue.*

The fund requirement and deployment are based on internal management estimates and have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution. These are based on current conditions and are subject to change in the light of changes in external circumstances or costs or other financial conditions and other external factors.

IN CASE OF ANY INCREASE IN THE ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF FUNDS EARMARKED FOR THE OBJECTS, SUCH ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY WILL BE MET BY WAY OF MEANS AVAILABLE TO OUR COMPANY, INCLUDING FROM INTERNAL ACCRUALS. IF THE ACTUAL UTILIZATION TOWARDS ANY OF THE OBJECTS IS LOWER THAN THE PROPOSED DEPLOYMENT SUCH BALANCE WILL BE USED FOR FUTURE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING FUNDING EXISTING OBJECTS, IF REQUIRED. IN CASE OF DELAYS IN RAISING FUNDS FROM THE ISSUE, OUR COMPANY MAY DEPLOY CERTAIN AMOUNTS TOWARDS ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED OBJECTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL ACCRUALS OR UNSECURED LOANS (BRIDGE FINANCING) AND IN SUCH CASE THE FUNDS RAISED SHALL BE UTILIZED TOWARDS REPAYMENT OF SUCH UNSECURED LOANS OR RECOUPING OF INTERNAL ACCRUALS. HOWEVER, WE CONFIRM THAT NO BRIDGE FINANCING HAS BEEN AVAILED AS ON DATE, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO BEING REPAID FROM THE ISSUE PROCEEDS. WE FURTHER CONFIRM THAT NO PART OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUE WILL BE UTILIZED FOR THE REPAYMENT OF ANY OUTSTANDING UNSECURED LOANS, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM THE PROMOTER, PROMOTER GROUP, OR ANY RELATED PARTY, AS OF THE DATE OF THE DRAFT RED HERRING PROSPECTUS.

As we operate in a competitive environment, our Company may have to revise its business plan from time to time and consequently our fund requirements may also change. Our Company's historical expenditure may not be reflective of our future expenditure plans. Our Company may have to revise its estimated costs, fund allocation and fund requirements owing to various factors such as economic and business conditions, increased competition and other external factors which may not be within the control of our management. This may entail rescheduling or revising the planned expenditure and funding requirements, including the expenditure for a particular purpose at the discretion of the Company's management.

For further details on the risks involved in our business plans and executing our business strategies, please see "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25 of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus.
