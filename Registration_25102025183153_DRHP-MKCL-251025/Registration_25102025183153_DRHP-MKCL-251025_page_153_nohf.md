The Rules mandate segregation, collection, and proper disposal of plastic waste through extended producer responsibility (EPR), which requires producers, importers, and brand owners to take back the plastic waste generated from their products and ensure its recycling or safe disposal. They ban the use of plastic carry bags below 50 microns in thickness, as thinner bags are difficult to collect and recycle.

Local bodies and Gram Panchayats are required to set up collection, segregation, and waste processing systems, while waste generators must ensure segregation of plastic at source. Retailers and street vendors are prohibited from providing plastic carry bags free of cost, encouraging the shift to reusable alternatives.

The Rules were later amended in 2018, 2021, and 2022 to introduce phased bans on single-use plastic items, mandatory EPR registration through a centralized portal, and stricter compliance monitoring to promote a circular economy.

In essence, these rules seek to minimize plastic pollution, encourage recycling, and promote environmentally sustainable alternatives while holding producers and users accountable for plastic waste management.
