For new suppliers or yarns with specialized specifications, sample lots are requested for thorough technical evaluation. These samples are tested against critical parameters including tensile strength, colorfastness, uniformity, and compatibility with the designated knitting process. Only materials that meet our Company's stringent quality standards are approved for procurement. In cases where the yarn does not meet the required criteria, it is formally returned to the supplier.

## 4. Purchase Order Placement

Following supplier selection and quality approval (if applicable), a formal purchase order is issued. This document outlines detailed specifications, quantities, agreed rates, delivery timelines, and payment terms. The purchase order also serves as a contractual agreement, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## 5. Inbound Logistics & Delivery

The logistics team coordinates with suppliers to ensure timely dispatch and delivery of yarn to our Company's manufacturing facility. Deliveries are scheduled in alignment with the production timeline to maintain smooth workflow continuity and prevent bottlenecks.

## 6. Material Verification

Upon arrival at the plant, the yarn undergoes a comprehensive quality check and verification process. The incoming material is inspected for conformity with the order specifications and approved sample standards. Batches that meet the required criteria are cleared for immediate use in production. However, if the yarn fails to meet the quality standards, it is rejected and returned to the supplier, with discrepancies duly reported and addressed.

## Q. Manufacturing Process

### Manufacturing Process for Anti Pilling Fabrics

#### Step 1: Knitting

The process begins with knitting, where yarns are interlooped using circular or flat knitting machines to create fabric. This knitted fabric serves as the base material for further processing. The choice of yarn and knitting technique significantly influences the fabric's texture, strength, and stretch.

#### Step 2: Heat Setting

In this step, the knitted fabric is subjected to controlled heat in a stenter machine. Heat setting stabilizes the fabric dimensions, reduces shrinkage, and prepares the fabric structure for improved chemical absorption in later stages. It also helps reduce fabric distortion and curling, especially in synthetic and blended fibers.

#### Step 3: Sueding

The fabric undergoes sueding (also called peach finishing), where fine abrasive rollers gently brush the surface to raise short fibers, creating a soft, velvety texture. This enhances fabric comfort and appearance, and also improves the anchoring of antipilling agents applied later.

#### Step 4: Antipilling Chemical Coating

At this stage, the fabric is treated with antipilling agents, usually polymers or resins, that form a thin protective layer on fiber surfaces. These chemicals bind loose fibers and reduce the tendency of fibers to break and form pills when exposed to friction or abrasion during use.

#### Step 5: Drying

After coating, the fabric passes through a drying chamber (usually within the stenter or a separate dryer) to cure the antipilling treatment and remove moisture. Proper drying ensures that the chemical finishes bond securely with the fibers for lasting effectiveness.

#### Step 6: Compaction

The dried fabric is compacted using a compactor machine to control shrinkage and bring the fabric to the desired final width and thickness. This step also improves the fabric's feel and dimensional stability, ensuring it
