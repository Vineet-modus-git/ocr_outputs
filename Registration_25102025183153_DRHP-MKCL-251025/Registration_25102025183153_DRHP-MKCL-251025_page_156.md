The Indian Contract Act, 1872 governs all contracts and agreements in India. It lays down the essentials of a valid contract such as free consent, lawful consideration, competence of parties, and enforceability by law. The Act defines different types of contracts (void, voidable, contingent) and specifies performance obligations, breach consequences, and remedies including damages and compensation. It forms the legal backbone of commercial and personal agreements.

**Specific Relief Act, 1963**

The Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides for specific performance of contracts, injunctions, and other equitable remedies. Instead of just monetary compensation, courts can direct a party to perform its contractual obligations, return property, or restrain wrongful acts. The Act is especially significant for contracts relating to immovable property, intellectual property, and unique goods, where monetary damages are inadequate. Amendments in 2018 made specific performance of contracts a rule rather than an exception.

**Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881**

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 regulates promissory notes, bills of exchange, and cheques, which are widely used for commercial transactions. It defines their characteristics, transferability, and legal protections for holders in due course. The Act also lays down provisions for dishonour of cheques, penalties, and criminal liability for cheque bounce under Section 138. This law ensures trust and smooth functioning of financial instruments in commerce.

**Income Tax Act, 1961**

The Income Tax Act, 1961 is India's primary legislation governing the levy, computation, collection, and recovery of income tax on income earned by individuals, companies, firms, and other entities.

The Act also specifies tax rates, advance tax provisions, Tax Deducted at Source (TDS), assessment procedures, penalties for non-compliance, and the powers of income tax authorities. The Act is updated annually through the Union Budget via the Finance Act to reflect changes in tax policy.

**Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017**

The Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017 forms the backbone of India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. It provides for the levy and collection of GST on intra-state supplies of goods and services by the Central Government. The Act establishes a comprehensive framework for registration, classification, valuation, invoicing, input tax credit, filing of returns, audits, assessments, and enforcement actions. It also specifies penalties for non-compliance and mechanisms for dispute resolution. The CGST Act works alongside the State GST Acts and the Integrated GST (IGST) Act to ensure a unified indirect tax structure across India, replacing multiple cascading taxes like VAT, excise, and service tax.

**Customs Act, 1962**

The Customs Act, 1962 governs the import and export of goods in India and ensures proper levy and collection of customs duties. It lays down procedures for the clearance of goods through customs, including filing of bills of entry, shipping bills, and payment of duties. The Act provides for prohibitions and restrictions on import/export of specified goods, anti-smuggling measures, valuation of goods, warehousing provisions, and adjudication of disputes. It also empowers customs officers to conduct inspections, seizures, and arrests in cases of violations. The Customs Act plays a critical role in safeguarding India's economic interests, regulating foreign trade, and ensuring compliance with international trade obligations.

**Labour Codes (Applicable But Not Yet Notified)**

**Code on Wages, 2019**

The Code establishes a uniform definition of wages and provides a single framework for regulating minimum wages, payment of wages, timely payment of salaries, and bonus entitlements for employees across both organized and unorganized sectors. It empowers the central and state governments to fix floor wages, mandates equal pay for equal work irrespective of gender, and prescribes penalties for delayed or unlawful deductions from wages.
