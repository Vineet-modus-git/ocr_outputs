20. We face competition from Organized, Unorganized as well as international players.

Our industry is highly competitive and largely unorganized, with a mix of domestic and international players operating across different segments. We face competition from organized domestic companies with established brands, unorganized local manufacturers, as well as international manufacturers who may benefit from lower production costs and favorable trade or duty structures in their respective countries.

Intense competition in certain markets may result in pricing pressures, reduced market share, and increased marketing and distribution costs. Additionally, competition from lower-cost manufacturers or companies with greater operational efficiencies could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, maintain margins, and achieve our business objectives. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and overall business performance.

Please refer to the chapter “Our Business-Competition” on page 123 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

21. Our business is dependent on the availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of electrical power and water at reasonable costs.

Our operations require a consistent supply of electricity and water, and any disruption, shortage, or increase in the cost of these essential utilities could restrict our ability to operate at full capacity, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our reliance on captive or third-party power supply exposes us to risks such as operational failures, accidents, or price fluctuations, which may impact our profitability. Additionally, we have applied for requisite approvals for the use of groundwater application dated 28.06.2025, and in the event such application is denied or delayed, we may not be able to access or use the required water supply, which could materially and adversely affect our operations. For further details please refer to the chapter “Our Business” and “Government and other approvals” on page 123 and 249 of this Draft Red Heering Prospectus.

22. Our Company is involved in certain legal proceedings, and any adverse outcome in such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.

Our Company is currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings, both as a plaintiff and as a respondent, which are
pending at various stages of adjudication. While the management believes these matters are not likely to have a material adverse
impact on the Company, there can be no assurance that decisions in the future will be favorable to us or that no new proceedings
will be initiated.

As on date, there are no criminal proceedings pending against our Company. However, certain demands and adjustments raised by statutory authorities are currently under review. Based on the records available on the TRACES portal of the Income Tax Department, TDS defaults aggregating ₹5.23 lakhs have been recorded against our Company for various assessment years, out of which ₹1.07 lakhs has been paid subsequent to the restated period and the balance ₹4.16 lakhs remains disputed. These demands primarily relate to minor TDS defaults and adjustments under Section 143(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, which are pending resolution. While no litigation has been formally initiated in these cases, any adverse outcome may lead to additional tax liability, interest, or penalties.

Further, our Company has initiated certain criminal and commercial recovery proceedings against third parties to recover
outstanding dues and enforce payments. These include proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
Additionally, our Company has filed a claim for recovery under Section 18 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
Development Act, 2006, which is currently pending before the MSME Samadhan Authority.
