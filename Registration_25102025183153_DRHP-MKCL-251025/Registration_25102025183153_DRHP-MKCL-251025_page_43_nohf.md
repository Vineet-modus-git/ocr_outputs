Although, there have been no material events relating to this risk factor as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there
can be no assurance that such events may not occur in the future.

44. We may not be successful in implementing our business strategies.

The success of our business depends substantially on our ability to implement our business strategies effectively. Even though we
have successfully executed our business strategies in the past, there is no guarantee that we can implement the same on time and
within the estimated budget going forward, or that we will be able to meet the expectations of our targeted clients. Changes in
regulations applicable to us may also make it difficult to implement our business strategies. Failure to implement our business
strategies would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

45. Industry information included in this prospectus has been derived from industry reports. There can be no assurance that such third-party statistical, financial and other industry information is either complete or accurate.

We have relied on the reports of certain independent third party for purposes of inclusion of such information in this prospectus.
These reports are subject to various limitations and based upon certain assumptions that are subjective in nature. We have not
independently verified data from such industry reports and other sources. Although we believe that the data may be considered to
be reliable, their accuracy, completeness and underlying assumptions are not guaranteed. For Further details please refer to the “Our
Industry” on page 109 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

46. The deployment of funds raised through this Issue shall not be subject to any Monitoring Agency and shall be purely dependent on the discretion of the management of our Company.

The deployment of funds raised through this Issue will not be monitored by any independent agency and will be entirely at the
discretion of the management and the Board of Directors of our Company. Since the Issue size is below ₹5,000 lakhs, there is no
mandatory requirement to appoint an Independent Monitoring Agency to oversee utilization of the proceeds. For further details
please refer to “Object of the Issue” on page 82 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

Any inability to effectively deploy the Issue proceeds in accordance with the objects of the Issue could adversely affect our financial position. Further, as per Regulation 262(6), in respect of the portion of proceeds allocated for working capital exceeding ₹500 lakhs, we are required to submit a certificate from our statutory auditor to the EMERGE exchange(s) while filing quarterly financial results until such proceeds are fully utilized.

47. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, working capital requirements, capital expenditure and restrictive covenants in our financing arrangements.

We may retain all our future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of our business. As a result, we may not declare
dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion
of our Board of Directors and will depend on factors that our Board of Directors deem relevant, including among others, our results
of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, business prospects and any other financing arrangements. Accordingly,
realization of a gain on shareholders investments may largely depend upon the appreciation of the price of our Equity Shares. There
can be no assurance that our Equity Shares will appreciate in value. For details of our dividend history, see “Dividend Policy” on
page 181 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

Although, Our Company has not declared or paid any dividend as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

48. Any future issuance of Equity Shares may dilute your shareholdings, and sale of the Equity Shares by our major shareholders may adversely affect the trading price of our Equity Shares.

Any future equity issuance by our Company may lead to the dilution of investors' shareholdings in our Company. In addition, any
sale of substantial Equity Shares in the public market after the completion of this Issue, including by our major shareholders, or the
perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of the Equity Shares and could significantly impair
our future ability to raise capital through offerings of the Equity Shares. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of the
Equity Shares held by the major shareholders of our Company or the availability of these Equity Shares for future sale will have on
the market price of our Equity Shares.

For further details of allotments, please refer to the chapter titled “Capital Structure” on page 65 of this Draft Red Herring
Prospectus.
