Forward looking statements reflect views as on the date of the *Draft Red Herring Prospectus* and not a guarantee of future performance. By their nature, certain market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. As a result, actual future gains or losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated. We cannot assure Bidders that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Given these uncertainties, Bidders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements and not to regard such statements as a guarantee of future performance. Forward-looking statements reflect the current views of our Company as of the date of this *Draft Red Herring Prospectus* and are not a guarantee of future performance. These statements are based on the management's beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information.

Our Company, our Directors, BRLM or any of their respective affiliates or advisors do not have any obligation to update or otherwise revise any statements reflecting circumstances arising after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of underlying events, even if the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition.
