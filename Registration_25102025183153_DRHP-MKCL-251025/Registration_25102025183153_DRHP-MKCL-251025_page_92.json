Raw Material</td><td>Raw material holding days for the F.Y. 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 were 109 days, 62 days and 76 days respectively. The holding period saw a reduction in F.Y. 2023-24 due to improved procurement planning and inventory management, followed by an increase in F.Y. 2024-25 on account of higher stocking to meet production requirements. The Company anticipates maintaining raw material holding days at around 70 days in F.Y. 2025-26 and 2026-27 respectively.</td></tr><tr><td>ii. Work In Progress</td><td>Work-in-progress inventory holding days for the F.Y. 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 were 4 days, 5 days and 10 days respectively. The increase in F.Y. 2024-25 was primarily due to higher production cycle times. The Company expects to maintain work-in-progress holding at around 9 days in F.Y. 2025-26 and 2026-27 respectively.</td></tr><tr><td>iii. Finished goods</td><td>Finished goods holding days for the F.Y. 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 were 39 days, 40 days and 28 days respectively. The decrease in F.Y. 2024-25 was driven by improved demand forecasting and faster order fulfilment. The Company expects finished goods holding days to remain at around levels of 26 days each for F.Y. 2025-26 and 2026-27.</td></tr><tr><td>iv. Consumable, Stores and packing materials</td><td>Consumables, stores and packing materials holding days for the F.Y. 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 were 3 days, 2 days and 6 days respectively. The temporary increase in F.Y. 2024-25 was on account of advance bulk purchases. The Company expects the holding period to normalize at 5 days each for F.Y. 2025-26 and 2026-27.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trade Receivables</strong></td><td>Trade receivable days increased from 57 in FY 2022 to 95 in FY 2023, before easing to 81 in FY 2025. The sharp rise was primarily due to the company's decision to extend more lenient credit terms to drive sales growth and capture market share. While this strategy boosted revenues, it also led to higher working capital needs and longer cash conversion cycles. From FY 2024 onwards, the company introduced tighter collection practices, resulting in a moderation of receivable days. Looking ahead, the company intends to maintain receivable days at around 80, balancing customer support through flexible credit terms with the need to preserve strong cash flows for future growth.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Short-term Loans and Advances</strong></td><td>Short-term loans and advances primarily comprise advances to suppliers, employees, and other operational advances. The balances stood at ₹416.17 lakhs, ₹739.59 lakhs, and ₹1,059.46 lakhs as at March 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2025, respectively, reflecting a gradual increase in line with the expansion of operations. As at June 30, 2025, the balance was ₹1,405.86 lakhs, which is broadly in line with the projected level as of March 31, 2026, indicating consistency in the Company's advance requirements and working capital deployment. The Company expects these levels to remain stable, with marginal growth to ₹1,410.00 lakhs and ₹1,645.00 lakhs for FY 2025-26 and FY 2026-27, respectively, in line with the overall increase in business volume.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Current Assets</strong></td><td>Other current assets primarily comprise prepaid expenses and other recoverables. The balance of other current assets stood at ₹4.99 lakhs, ₹5.34 lakhs, and ₹6.77 lakhs as at March 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2025, respectively, indicating a marginal increase in line with business expansion. For the stub period ended June 30, 2025, the balance was ₹10.67 lakhs. The Company projects this to remain broadly stable at ₹7.00 lakhs for FY 2025-26 and FY 2026-27, reflecting consistency in operational and administrative requirements. The level of other current assets is not material in relation to total current assets and is expected to remain steady over the projection period.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Current Liabilities</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trade Payables</strong></td><td>Trade payables holding days stood at 65 days, 56 days, and 48 days for FY2022, FY2023, and FY2025 respectively, reflecting a steady reduction over the years. This decline was primarily driven by improved cash flow management and a strategic shift towards quicker settlement of dues to strengthen supplier relationships. Going forward, the company plans to further reduce the trade payables period to around 40 days, capitalizing on early payment discounts offered by vendors. This move is aimed at enhancing profitability by lowering procurement costs, while continuing to maintain healthy supplier relationships and ensuring a more efficient cash flow cycle to support future growth.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Current Liabilities</strong></td><td>Other Current Liabilities mainly include statutory dues, expenses payable to employees, interest accrued, and advances to suppliers of goods and capital machinery. Other current liabilities holding days for the F.Y. 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 were 7 days, 10 days and 16 days respectively. The increase in holding</td></tr></tbody></table>"}]
