Notes:

1. Trade receivables as a percentage of revenue are calculated by dividing the trade receivables by the revenue of that period.
2. Inventory as a percentage of revenue is calculated by dividing the inventory for a particular period by the revenue of that period.
3. Trade payables as a percentage of revenue are calculated by dividing the trade payables for a particular period by the revenue of that period.
4. Working capital requirement as a percentage of revenue is calculated by dividing the working capital requirement for a particular period by the revenue of that period.

## Receivables Growth Aligned with Revenue Expansion

Trade receivables have increased in line with higher sales volumes as the Company expanded its capacity and transitioned into a fully integrated yarn-to-cloth operation. Trade receivable days rose from 57 days in FY 2023 to 95 days in FY 2024, before moderating to 81 days in FY 2025. For the stub period ended June 30, 2025, trade receivable days stood at approximately 82 days. In absolute terms, receivables are projected to increase from ₹3,822.52 lakhs in FY 2025 to ₹4990.68 lakhs in FY 2026 and ₹5,833.42 lakhs in FY 2027, in line with operational growth. Going forward, receivable days are expected to stabilize at around 80 days, reflecting a balanced approach between providing credit to customers to support market expansion and maintaining sufficient liquidity.

## Inventory Requirements Linked to Manufacturing Integration

With the transition to end-to-end manufacturing in FY 2024–25, the Company now oversees the entire production cycle, necessitating adequate levels of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods to ensure seamless operations and timely order fulfilment. Efficiency improvements from this integration have led to reduced inventory intensity, with inventory days declining from 155 days in FY 2023 to 119 days in FY 2025. For the stub period ended June 30, 2025, inventory days stood at 61, primarily due to an unexpected surge in orders during the first quarter of the financial year. In absolute terms, inventories are projected to increase from ₹3,893.99 lakhs in FY 2025 to ₹4,725.42 lakhs in FY 2026 and ₹5,535.00 lakhs in FY 2027. Going forward, inventory days are expected to stabilize at around 110 days, in line with higher production volumes and expanded operations.

## Reduction in Trade Payables due to Early-Payment Strategy

Trade payable days have declined significantly as the Company implemented a strategy of faster supplier payments to avail early-payment discounts and strengthen supplier relationships. These discounts vary based on purchase volume and payment mode (for instance, flat rebates per 100 MT or percentage-based discounts on bulk or cash purchases). While this approach enhances procurement efficiency and reduces raw material costs, it also limits credit availability and increases the overall working capital requirement. Payable days decreased from 65 days in FY 2023 to 48 days in FY 2025, and stood at 43 days for the stub period ended June 30, 2025. They are expected to further reduce to around 40 days from FY 2026 onwards. As a percentage of revenue, trade payables declined from 13.77% in FY 2023 to 9.13% in FY 2025 and are projected to remain below 7% to 8% during FY 2026–27.

## Overall Impact on Working Capital Cycle

The Cash Conversion Cycle was 148 days in both FY 2023 and FY 2024, rose slightly to 153 days in FY 2025, and improved to 100 days for the stub period ended June 30, 2025, as efficiency gains in inventory and receivables were partly offset by lower trade payables. Looking ahead, the cash conversion cycle is expected to stabilize at approximately 150 days in FY 2025–26 and FY 2026–27, reflecting a balanced approach to liquidity and operational efficiency. Overall, while receivable and inventory management have improved, the reduction in trade payables has kept the cash conversion cycle broadly stable in recent years.

Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 38.16% in FY 2023, increased to 41.48% in FY 2024, and moderated to 37.21% in FY 2025. It is projected to remain in the range of 38% of revenue in FY 25-26 and FY 26–27, broadly stable in percentage terms but higher in absolute value, in line with the scale-up in operations.

The Company's capex and shift to end-to-end manufacturing have supported capacity expansion and improved inventory efficiency. However, higher receivables linked to sales growth and strategic reduction in trade payables to capture supplier discounts have
