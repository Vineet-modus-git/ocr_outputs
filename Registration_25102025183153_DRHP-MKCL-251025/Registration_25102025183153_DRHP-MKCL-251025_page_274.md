The Equity Shares have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws in the United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to, registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Equity Shares are only being offered or sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act and the applicable laws of the jurisdictions where those offers and sales occur.

The Equity Shares have not been and will not be registered, listed or otherwise qualified in any other jurisdiction outside India and may not be offered or sold, and applications may not be made by persons in any such jurisdiction, except in compliance with the applicable laws of such jurisdiction.

## Joint Holders

Where 2 (two) or more persons are registered as the holders of any Equity Shares, they will be deemed to hold such Equity Shares as joint-holders with benefits of survivorship.

## Nomination facility to Bidders

In accordance with Section 72 of the Companies Act, 2013 the sole or first applicant, along with other joint applicant, may nominate any one person in whom, in the event of the death of sole applicant or in case of joint applicant, death of all the applicants, as the case may be, the Equity Shares allotted, if any, shall vest. A person, being a nominee, entitled to the Equity Shares by reason of the death of the original holder(s), shall in accordance with Section 72 of the Companies Act, 2013 be entitled to the same advantages to which he or she would be entitled if he or she were the registered holder of the Equity Share(s). Where the nominee is a minor, the holder(s) may make a nomination to appoint, in the prescribed manner, any person to become entitled to Equity Share(s) in the event of his or her death during the minority. A nomination shall stand rescinded upon a sale of equity share(s) by the person nominating. A buyer will be entitled to make a fresh nomination in the manner prescribed. Fresh nomination can be made only on the prescribed form available on request at the Registered Office of our Company or to the Registrar and Transfer Agents of our Company.

In accordance with Section 72 of the Companies Act, 2013 any Person who becomes a nominee by virtue of Section 72 of the Companies Act, 2013 shall upon the production of such evidence as may be required by the Board, elect either:

(a) to register himself or herself as the holder of the Equity Shares; or

(b) to make such transfer of the Equity Shares, as the deceased holder could have made.

Further, the Board may at any time give notice requiring any nominee to choose either to be registered himself or herself or to transfer the Equity Shares, and if the notice is not complied with within a period of 90 (ninety) days, the Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other moneys payable in respect of the Equity Shares, until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

Since the allotment of Equity Shares in the Issue is in dematerialized form, there is no need to make a separate nomination with us. Nominations registered with the respective depository participant of the applicant would prevail. If the investors require changing the nomination, they are requested to inform their respective depository participant.
