## Business Overview

Founded in 1997 by Mr. Arun Gupta along with Mr. Rajesh Gupta, Mr. Ravi Gupta and Mr. Vishnu Gupta, the Company began commercial operations in 2013 (blankets), then broadened into fabrics and select technical textiles from 2021. It has since transitioned from limited processing to a fully integrated yarn-to-cloth model housed at Ludhiana, enabling in-house knitting, dyeing, printing and finishing with shorter lead times and tighter quality control. The Company was converted into a public limited company in January 2025; the present promoters are Mr. Arun Gupta, Mr. Piyush Gupta and Mr. Chirag Gupta.

To support this shift to end-to-end manufacturing, the Company undertook a structured capex program starting 2022—adding modern, high-throughput equipment (e.g., PLC-controlled multi-chamber thermal-oil systems, dyeing units, brushing, embossing/3D punching, bonding, shearing and printing), along with imported machinery that now underpins the integrated plant. Installed capacity scaled to ~75,00,000 KGs by FY25 (from ~37,50,000 KGs in FY24), with utilisation reflecting the step-up in capacity and evolving product

**What we make.** The portfolio spans blankets, knitted fabrics (winterwear and multi-season), sherpa/raised fabrics and select garments. FY25 revenue was primarily from knitted cloth (≈85%), with additional contributions from garments (~6%), job work (~4%) and blankets (~3%). Sales were predominantly domestic.

**How we operate.** The Company follows an order-based, demand-driven model—production commences on confirmed orders—minimizing inventory, aligning procurement with sales, and improving working-capital discipline. Integrated manufacturing and a clustered supplier base in Ludhiana enable shorter lead times and cost efficiency. The model is B2B-led with repeat institutional/wholesale demand. Top-10 customer concentration reduced to ~34% in FY25 (from ~41% in FY24), reflecting a broadening base.

**Capacity and utilisation.** Capacity has scaled materially in recent years to 75,00,000 KGs (FY25). Utilisation moderated to ~65% in FY25 (vs. ~80% in FY24) due to step-up in installed capacity and product mix.

### Competitive position—key strengths.

* Vertically integrated plant with modern machinery enabling quality, scale and customization.

* Strategic cluster location (Ludhiana) for raw-material access, skilled labour and logistics.

* Order-based production model that supports cash-flow discipline.

* Experienced promoter group and trained operating teams.

### Growth strategy.

* Technical textiles: invest in specialized processing to serve higher-margin industrial uses (auto, construction, home improvement, healthcare).

* Market expansion: deepen domestic distribution; revive exports through compliance readiness and service levels.

* Working-capital optimisation: leverage early-payment discounts on yarn and tighten cash-conversion cycle.

The facility operates with sanctioned power load and thermal systems (boilers/thermopac) and recycles treated water from the ETP for select uses and vegetation, reducing freshwater draw.
