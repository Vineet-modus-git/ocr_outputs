5. Risk Related to Customer Retention, Dependence on Existing Customers, and Acquisition of New Customers.

The Company's revenue is derived from a mix of retained and new customers, with retained customers contributing 68.77% of total revenue in June 30, 2025, 77.21% in Fiscal 2025, 73.05% in Fiscal 2024, and 84.08% in Fiscal 2023, while new customers contributed 23%, 26.95%, and 15.92%, respectively. Any failure to retain existing customers or attract new customers could adversely impact the Company's revenue, profitability, and growth prospects. Additionally, reliance on a limited number of high-value retained customers increases the risk that loss or reduced business from such customers could materially affect financial performance.
