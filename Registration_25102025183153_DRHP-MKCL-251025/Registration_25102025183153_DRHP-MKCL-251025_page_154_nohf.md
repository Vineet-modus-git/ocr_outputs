**Stamp Acts (Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and State Stamp Laws)**

The Indian Stamp Act, 1899, along with corresponding state-specific Stamp Acts, regulates the imposition of stamp duty on legal, commercial, and financial documents to make them valid and legally enforceable. Stamp duty is payable on instruments such as agreements, deeds of transfer, conveyances, leases, share certificates, debentures, and loan instruments. The duty rate varies depending on the nature of the document and the state in which it is executed, since states have the power to amend or supplement the central law. Proper stamping is critical because unstamped or insufficiently stamped documents are inadmissible as evidence in court unless the deficiency is rectified with penalty. The law also empowers authorities to inspect documents, levy penalties for evasion, and prescribe procedures for adjudication of stamp duty disputes.
