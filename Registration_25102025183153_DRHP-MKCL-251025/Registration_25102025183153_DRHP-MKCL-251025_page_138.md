## d. Details about raw material procurement

### Procurement Process for Yarn

Our company's operations commence with the procurement of yarn, the principal raw material used across our manufacturing verticals. Our Company is located in Ludhiana, a hub for winter and semi-winter textile products, which facilitates sourcing. The region offers a well-developed ecosystem for yarn trading, enabling easy access to quality raw materials and ensuring smooth procurement operations with minimal lead times or supply disruptions. Rather than relying on a single vendor, we have established a diversified supplier base, which enhances our operational resilience, especially during peak production periods. This multi-supplier model also strengthens our bargaining position and allows for flexible procurement volumes based on order flow.

To further optimize resource utilization, our procurement strategy is closely aligned with an order-based production system. Yarn purchases are initiated only upon the receipt of confirmed customer orders, ensuring raw material intake is directly tied to actual production requirements. This just-in-time approach minimizes excess inventory, reduces storage overhead, and improves working capital efficiency. By integrating procurement planning with production schedules, we are able to maintain tight control over input costs while supporting our Company's broader goals of financial discipline and operational agility.

### 1. Order-Based Requirement Identification

Yarn procurement is initiated only upon receipt of confirmed customer orders. The production planning team analyses the order specifications, including fabric type, blend, weight, and colour to determine the precise yarn requirements. This ensures alignment between procurement and production, eliminating the need for surplus inventory and reducing working capital deployment.

### 2. Supplier Coordination

Once requirements are finalized, the procurement team engages with a network of pre-approved local yarn distributors based in Ludhiana. These vendors are selected based on their reliability, quality consistency, and responsiveness. The team obtains quotations, checks for availability, and negotiates commercial terms where necessary.
