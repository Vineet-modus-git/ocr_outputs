Common Pursuits

1. Our Company and certain of our Group Companies are engaged in similar lines of business, which may be regarded as common pursuits and may give rise to potential conflict of interest situations. The details are as follows:

* **Nature of Common Pursuit:** Both our Company and Star Cottex limited are engaged in manufacturing of textiles products.

* **Reason/Justification:** The businesses have evolved independently over a period of time based on market opportunities, promoter initiatives, and the specific focus of each entity. While there is similarity in the line of business, each company operates with distinct strategies, target markets, customer bases, and product segments, thereby reducing the likelihood of significant overlap.

* **Conflict of Interest:** Notwithstanding the above, there may arise situations of conflict of interest in respect of business opportunities, customers, suppliers, or use of resources, as our Company and such Group Companies operate in related sectors.

Our Company shall adopt appropriate measures permitted by law, including adherence to applicable corporate governance requirements, ensuring arm's length dealings, and maintaining transparent business practices, to mitigate such potential conflicts of interest and safeguard the interests of our shareholders.

2. Our Group Companies do not have any business interest in our Company except as otherwise disclosed in the "**Our Group Company**" and "**Restated Financial Information** – Note 32 – Related Party Transactions", on pages 254 and 182, respectively.

3. Except as set forth in "**Restated Financial Information**" beginning on page 182, there are no related business transactions between our Group Companies and our Company.
