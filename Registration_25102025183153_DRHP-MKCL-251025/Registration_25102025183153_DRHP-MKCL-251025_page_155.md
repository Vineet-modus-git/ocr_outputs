The Professions, Trades, Callings, and Employments Acts, enacted by individual states, provide for the levy and collection of professional tax on individuals engaged in any profession, trade, calling, or employment.

The maximum tax amount is capped at â‚¹2,500 per annum as per Article 276 of the Constitution of India, though the slab rates vary by state. Failure to register, deduct, or pay professional tax attracts interest, penalties, and prosecution under the respective state law.
