Cash flow of a company is a key indicator to show the extent of cash generated from operations to meet capital expenditure, pay dividends, repay loans and make new investments without raising finance from external resources. If our Company is not able to generate sufficient cash flows, it may affect our business and financial operations. For further please refer chapter titled “Restated Financial Information” beginning on Page 182 of this Red Herring Prospectus.

**11. Volatility in the prices and availability of yarns and other raw materials may adversely affect our business and results of operations.**

Our Company primarily relies on polyester yarn, spun yarn, acrylic yarn, other man-made yarns, cotton yarn, and polyester-cotton blended yarns for our manufacturing and processing operations. The type and quantity of yarn used vary according to the specific requirements of our customers for the same product. We are entirely dependent on external suppliers for these raw materials, which constitute a substantial portion of our total cost of production.

Fluctuations in the prices of yarns and other raw materials, including due to market volatility, changes in import/export duties, or supply chain disruptions, could increase our cost of production. While we may attempt to pass on price increases to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so fully or in a timely manner. Additionally, any shortage, interruption in supply, or reduction in the quality of these raw materials could adversely affect our production schedules, sales, profitability, and overall business operations.

Although, there have been no material events relating to this risk factor as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there can be no assurance that such events may not occur in the future.

**12. Our lenders have a charge over our movable and immovable properties, stock, book debts, plant and machinery, and fixed deposits in respect of loans/facilities availed by us.**

We have availed various working capital and term loan facilities from lenders and secured such borrowings by creating charges on our current assets, including stock-in-trade, raw materials, goods in process, finished goods, book debts, movable plant and machinery, fixed deposits, as well as equitable mortgage over our immovable properties situated at Village Seera, Village Meharban, and Basti Jodhewal in Ludhiana, Punjab. Additionally, we have availed a vehicle loan secured by hypothecation of a Maruti Ciaz car.

In the event we default in repayment of the aforesaid borrowings, together with any interest, costs, charges, or other monies payable to the bank, our lenders may enforce their rights under the financing documents and take possession of, and dispose of, the secured properties and assets. This could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For further details on our secured borrowings and financial indebtedness, please refer to the chapter titled “Statement of Financial Indebtedness” beginning on page 222 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

Although, there have been no material events relating to this risk factor as of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, there can be no assurance that such events may not occur in the future.

**13. We have significant working capital requirements, and our inability to meet them may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.**

Our business requires substantial working capital, primarily driven by inventory, and trade receivables. As per the restated financials, our net working capital requirements have increased over the years in line with revenue growth, resulting in higher inventory levels and increased receivables. Any delays or defaults in collection from customers could further elevate our working capital needs.
