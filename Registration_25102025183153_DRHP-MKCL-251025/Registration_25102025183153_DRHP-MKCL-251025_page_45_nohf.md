**54. Our growth will depend on our ability to build our brand and failure to do so will negatively impact our ability to effectively compete in this industry.**

We believe that we need to continue to build our brand, which will be critical for achieving widespread recognition of our services. Promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services. The brand promotion activities that we may undertake may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we are unable to promote and maintain our brand, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

**55. Our directors do not have experience of a listed company and in the absence of such experience, it could adversely affect our corporate governance and business operations of our Company.**

In the realm of corporate governance and leadership, the experience of directors plays a crucial role in steering the course of a company. It is often perceived that directors with prior experience in listed companies bring invaluable insights, knowledge, and strategic acumen to the boardroom. Furthermore, the absence of listed company experience among directors may limit their ability to effectively oversee risk management frameworks and succession planning strategies. These oversight responsibilities are critical in mitigating operational risks, ensuring organizational resilience, and safeguarding against potential conflicts of interest or ethical lapses. Although our company's board of directors is pivotal in shaping its strategic direction, ensuring regulatory compliance, and safeguarding stakeholder interests.

Further, our directors lack of direct experience in a listed environment may inadvertently expose the company to the risk of corporate governance and affect the business operation of our Company. For Further details, please refer to chapter titled “Our Management” beginning on Page 160 of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.

**56. External shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on our business and operations.**

In the past the Covid 19 pandemic has forced many countries including India to impose country-wide lockdowns, restrictions on travel and business operations including temporary closure of business. Further the pandemic has also been disruptive for the logistics business. Any future threat of a Covid-19 like situation cannot be ruled out and we cannot assure you that we shall be in a position to fully counter and/or address the effects of such an external shock to fully safeguard our business and operations.

**57. Our future funds requirements, in the form of fresh issue of capital or securities and/or loans taken by us, may be prejudicial to the interest of the shareholders depending upon the terms on which they are eventually raised.**

We may require additional capital from time to time depending on our business needs. Any fresh issue of shares or convertible securities would dilute the shareholding of the existing shareholders and such issuance may be done on terms and conditions, which may not be favourable to the then existing shareholders. If such funds are raised in the form of loans or debt, then it may substantially increase our interest burden and decrease our cash flows, thus prejudicially affecting our profitability and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders

**58. The market capitalization to revenue, market capitalisation to tangible assets, and enterprise value (“EV”) to EBITDA, based on the Issue Price of our Company, may not be indicative of the market price of our Company on listing or thereafter.**

The market capitalization to revenue, market capitalization to tangible assets, and enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA ratios based on the Issue Price of our Company may not accurately reflect the market price of our equity shares upon listing or at any time thereafter. These valuation metrics are influenced by various factors, including prevailing market conditions, investor sentiment, and company-specific developments, which may not be directly related to our operational performance or financial results.

The Issue Price has been determined based on multiple qualitative and quantitative factors, including comparisons with peer companies, industry outlook, and feedback from investors during the book-building process. However, there is no assurance that these metrics will remain consistent post-listing, as they may fluctuate due to external factors such as broader market volatility, economic conditions, or changes in industry dynamics.

Any significant deviation of the market price of our equity shares from these valuation metrics may adversely affect investor confidence and could lead to volatility in the trading price of our equity shares, thereby impacting the market perception of our Company.
