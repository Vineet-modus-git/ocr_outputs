part of this assessment, we consider certain indicators such as whether the lease is for a major part of the economic life of the asset.

When we are an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. We assess the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which we apply the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

When as an intermediate lessor we enter into an intermediate finance lease, we derecognise the right-of-use asset under the head lease which we transfer to the sub lessee, recognise the net investment in the sublease as an asset, recognise the difference between the right-of-use asset and the net investment as a gain or loss and continue to recognise the lease liability, i.e., the lease payments owed to the head lessor, for the head lease. Over the sublease term, the intermediate lessor recognises the interest income from the sublease and the interest expense for the head lease.

### (xii) Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs include interest, amortization of ancillary costs incurred and exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost. Borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognized as expense in the year in which they are incurred.

### (xiii) Share issue expenses

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares are adjusted with the securities premium.

### (xiv) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (including cost of raw materials and components, non-refundable taxes and other overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition) and estimated net realizable value after providing for obsolescence, where appropriate. The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on an item-by-item basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Net realizable value of semi-finished goods is determined with reference to the selling prices of related finished goods. Raw materials, packing materials and other supplies held for use in production of inventories are not written down below cost except in cases where material prices have declined, and it is estimated that the cost of the finished goods will exceed their net realizable value.

Cost of raw materials and packing materials are determined on a weighted average basis. Stores and spares are determined on a First in First Out basis. Semi-finished goods are determined at material cost and an appropriate share of production overheads. Finished goods are determined at material cost and an appropriate share of production overheads. Stock in trade are determined at purchase cost. Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are identified at the time of periodic physical verification of inventories and where necessary, a markdown is made for such inventories.

### (xv) Income Tax

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

We have determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and are therefore accounted for by us under Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

#### a. Current Tax

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.

#### b. Deferred Tax
