The fair values of the investment property are disclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.

(viii) Impairment

Non-financial assets

At each reporting date, we review the carrying amounts of our non-financial assets (other than deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Intangible assets under development and Goodwill are tested annually for impairment.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing
use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is
allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

The recoverable amount of an individual asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed. In respect of other assets for which impairment loss
has been recognised in prior periods, we review at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased
or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. Such a reversal is made only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Financial Assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, we apply expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment
loss. We follow a 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables.

As a practical expedient, we use a provision matrix to determine impairment loss on portfolio of its trade receivable. The
provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted
for forward-looking estimates. At regular intervals, the historically observed default rates are updated and changes in forward-
looking estimates are analysed. We also assess at each reporting date whether there is evidence of impairment for individual
trade receivables.

The application of simplified approach does not require us to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment loss
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. For recognition of impairment loss
on other financial assets and risk exposure, we determine whether there has been a material increase in the credit risk since
initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased materially, twelve-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss.
However, if credit risk has increased materially, lifetime ECL is used. If in subsequent period, the credit quality of the instrument
improves such that there is no longer a material increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to
recognizing impairment loss allowance based on twelve-month ECL.

ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to us in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows
that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate.

We recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets recorded amortised cost. At each reporting date we assess whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired. A financial asset is "credit-impaired" when one or more events have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the debtor;

- a breach of contract;

- the restructuring of a loan or advance by us on terms that we would not consider otherwise; and
