While the Industrial Policy, 1991 prescribes the limits and the conditions subject to which foreign investment can be made in different sectors of the Indian economy, FEMA regulates the precise manner in which such investment may be made. Under the Industrial Policy, 1991 unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the Indian economy up to any extent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is required to follow certain prescribed procedures for making such investment. The RBI and the concerned ministries/departments are responsible for granting approval for foreign investment. The Government has from time to time made policy pronouncements on foreign direct investment (“FDI”) through press notes and press releases. The regulatory framework, over a period of time, thus, consists of acts, regulations, press notes, press releases, and clarifications among other amendments. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry (formerly Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion), Government of India (“DPIIT”), issued the Consolidated FDI Policy Circular of 2020 (“FDI Policy”), which, with effect from October 15, 2020, subsumes and supersedes all press notes, press releases, clarifications, circulars issued by the DPIIT, which were in force as on October 15, 2020. The FDI Policy will be valid until the DPIIT issues an updated circular.
