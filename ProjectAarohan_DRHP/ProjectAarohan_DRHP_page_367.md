that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment at each reporting period as presented, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

## Other Intangible assets

### Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. An intangible asset is recognised only if it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to us and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition, other intangible assets, including those acquired by us in a business combination and have finite useful lives measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of an intangible asset is recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

### Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

### Amortisation

Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognised as depreciation and amortisation expense in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Goodwill is not amortised. The estimated useful lives are as follows

<table><thead><tr><td>Asset category</td><td>Useful life of the asset (In years)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Computer Software</td><td>4 to 6</td></tr><tr><td>Website</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table>

Amortization method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if appropriate.

## Intangible assets under development

Development expenditure is capitalized as part of the cost of the resulting intangible asset only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and we have and intend to have sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognized in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.

## (vii) Investment property

Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when there is a change in use or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the property is derecognized.

The investment property includes land and buildings held by us. Depreciation on building is provided over its useful life using the straight-line method (SLM), in a manner similar to PPE and no depreciation on the land is recorded in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
