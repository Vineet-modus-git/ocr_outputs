TIFAC had referred the matter to Arbitration. The Arbitration order was set aside by the Hon'ble District Court Alappuzha and referred back to the Arbitrator.

The management has not received any communication from IJIRA and has proposed to make legal representation to get a no due certificate.

Assumptions and estimates taken into account for measuring installed capacity include 288 working days in a year, at 3 shifts per day (each being 8 hours long) for all facilities except for Manufacturing Facility IV – Coir Mattress where 2 shifts (each being 8 hours) long has been considered.
