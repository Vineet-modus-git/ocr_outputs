Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks.

Credit risk on loans is limited because the counterparties are employees of the Group.

Credit risk on capital subsidy receivables is limited because the counterparty is a State Government and in the past the amount is regulatory being collected.

Other financial assets mainly includes security deposits given in relation to lease arrangements, for which agreements are signed and property possessions are taken for operations. The risk relating to refunds after vacating the premises is managed through successful negotiations or appropriate legal actions, where necessary.

### (ii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.

The Group has obtained term loans and working capital limits from various banks (disclosed in note 22 and 26).

Management monitors rolling forecast of the Group's liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between cash outflow and inflow. Usually, the excess of funds is invested in fixed deposits and other financial instruments. This is generally carried out in accordance with practice and limits set by the Group. The limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the Group operates.

The table below provides details regarding the contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities as at reporting dates.
