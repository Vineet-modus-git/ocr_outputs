ultimately expect it will have to return to the customer. We update its estimate of refund liabilities (and the corresponding change in the transaction price) at the end of each reporting period.

We have presented its right to return assets and refund liabilities under "Inventory" and "other current financial liabilities", respectively.

**c. Contract balances**

*Trade receivables*

A trade receivable is recognized if an amount of consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets for initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial assets.

*Contract assets*

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer, where that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. If we perform by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment.

*Contract liabilities*

A contract liability is recognized if a payment is received, or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from the customer before we transfer the related goods or services. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when we perform under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods or services to the customer).

**d. Other Operating income:**

Revenue from sale of scrap in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the transaction price.

Income from duty drawbacks are recognized in the statement of profit and loss account when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the entitlement is established in respect of exports made and disclosed as other operating revenues.

We initially recognise the government grants related to assets as deferred income at fair value if there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received, and we will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants related to the acquisition of assets are recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.

**(iv) Other Income**

*Interest Income*

For all financial instruments measured at amortized cost, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Interest income is included in other income in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

**(v) Property, plant, and equipment**

**a. Recognition and measurement**

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be recognised as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to us and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Items of property, plant and equipment (including capital-work-in progress) are measured at cost, which includes capitalised borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Freehold land is carried at a historical cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price/acquisition cost, net of any trade discounts and rebates, any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable from the tax authorities), any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use other incidental expenses and interest on borrowings attributable to acquisition of qualifying property, plant and equipment up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use and estimated cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. Machine spare parts are recognized in
