### viii) Impairment (continued)

#### b. Financial Assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss. The Group follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables.

As a practical expedient, the Group uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss on portfolio of its trade receivable. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At regular intervals, the historically observed default rates are updated and changes in forward-looking estimates are analysed. The Group also assesses at each reporting date whether there is evidence of impairment for individual trade receivables.

The application of simplified approach does not require the Group to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Group determines that whether there has been a material increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased materially, twelve-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased materially, lifetime ECL is used. If in subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a material increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on twelve-month ECL.

ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e. all shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate.

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets recorded amortised cost. At each reporting date the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is "credit-impaired" when one or more events the have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the debtor;

- a breach of contract;

- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;

- it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount of life time expected credit losses, except for the following, which are measured as twelve month expected credit losses :-

- debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and

- other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instruments) has not increased materially since initial recognition.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held).

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

#### Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

### ix) Employee benefits

#### a. Short term employee benefits

Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are classified as short-term employee benefits and are measured on undiscounted basis. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus etc., which are to be paid in exchange for the employee services and are recognised as an expense in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the employee renders the related service.

#### b. Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The Group makes specified monthly contributions towards government administered provident fund scheme. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the periods during which the related services are rendered by employees.

##### *Provident fund*

Contribution towards provident fund for certain employees is made to the regulatory authorities, where the Group has no further obligations. Such benefits are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the Group does not carry any further obligations, apart from the contributions made on a monthly basis.

#### c. Defined benefit plans

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan ('the asset ceiling'). To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. This rate is applied on the net defined benefit liability (asset), both as determined at the start of the annual reporting period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

#### d. Other long-term employee benefits - compensated absences

The employees of the Group are entitled to accrue certain compensated absences in a calendar year. The Group's net obligation in respect of accumulating compensated absences is the amount of future benefit that employees have accumulated at the end of the period/year. The obligation is measured annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Remeasurements are recognized in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement.
