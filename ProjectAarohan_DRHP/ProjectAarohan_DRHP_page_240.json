The underlying justification for this Scheme was, among other things, the restructuring within the group, the segregation of the warehousing business to enable focused management, unlock the potential of the Demerged Undertaking and the remaining business, and achieve a more efficient deployment of resources, leading to operational and cost efficiencies. Consequent to the Scheme’s implementation, the complete Demerged Undertaking, comprising, but not limited to, its debts, liabilities, properties, assets, licenses, employees, and extant legal proceedings, were formally transferred to and vested in the Resulting Company, with effect from the date the Scheme became operative. As consideration for the demerger, VEPL issued 129 compulsorily convertible preference shares of face value ₹10 each for every 1,000 equity shares held by the shareholders of our Company. These shares were allotted to the members of the Demerged Undertaking whose names appeared in its register of members, or to their recognised heirs, executors, administrators, other legal representatives, or successors in title. Simultaneously, our Company’s equity shares in VEPL (excluding those held in a nominee capacity) were cancelled, which resulted in VEPL ceasing to be a subsidiary. Furthermore, two equity shares held by our Company in a nominee capacity were transferred to Mathew Antony Joseph and Jacob Joseph George."}, {"bbox": [246, 1026, 1557, 1188], "category": "Text", "text": "The Scheme became effective on August 7, 2025 (being the date on which Board of Directors of the Demerged Company and Resulting Company acknowledge in writing that all the conditions and matters referred to in the scheme have occurred or have been fulfilled, obtained or waived, as applicable, in accordance with the scheme).
