Frequent closures may adversely affect brand perception and customer trust in the affected regions, potentially resulting in a loss of customer loyalty. In the last three Fiscals and the three month period ended June 30, 2025, we have closed four COCO Stores. These closures were primarily due to low revenue generation from these stores.
