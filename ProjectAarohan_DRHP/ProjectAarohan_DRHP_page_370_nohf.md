expenses and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

## Other long-term employee benefits - compensated absences

Our employees are entitled to accrue certain compensated absences in a calendar year. Our net obligation in respect of accumulating compensated absences is the amount of future benefit that employees have accumulated at the end of the year. The obligation is measured annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Remeasurements are recognized in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as we do not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement.

## Share-based payments

Our employees receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). We measure compensation cost relating to employee stock options plans using the fair valuation method in accordance with Ind AS 102 "Share-Based Payment".

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using the Black Scholes model and the cost is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in share-based payment reserve in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in a graded vesting manner. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and our best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.

In case of cancellation or settlement of grant of equity instruments during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied), we shall account for the cancellation or settlement as an acceleration of vesting and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period. Any payment made to the employee on the cancellation or settlement of the grant shall be accounted for as the repurchase of an equity interest, i.e., as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

## (x) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

### Financial Instruments - Financial Assets

#### a. Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivables are initially recognized when they originate. All other financial assets are initially recognized when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not at Fair value through profit and loss account ("FVTPL"), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

#### b. Classification and subsequent measurement

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at:

- Amortised cost;

- Fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI") – equity investment; or

- FVOCI– debt investment; or

- FVTPL

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless we change the business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.
