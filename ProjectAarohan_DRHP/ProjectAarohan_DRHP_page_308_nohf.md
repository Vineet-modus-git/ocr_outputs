## B. Leases as lessor

The Group leases out its property including its investment property. The Group has classified these leases as operating leases, because they do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets. Note 5 sets out information about the operating leases of investment property.

Rental income recognised by the Group during the three months period ended 30 June 2025 was Rs. 4.66 million (31 March 2025: Rs. 24.26 million) (31 March 2024: Rs. 17.71 million) (31 March 2023: Rs. 5.99 million).
