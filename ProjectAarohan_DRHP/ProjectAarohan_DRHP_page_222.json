This approach incorporates various checks and balances throughout the manufacturing process. As of June 30, 2025, our dedicated quality control team comprises 21 employees which regularly supervises and ensures that our quality control procedures are adhered to at each stage. We observe high quality standards and good manufacturing practices at our manufacturing facilities. Our facilities have received certifications from Sedex, ISO and BIS (for details, see \"Manufacturing-Facilities\"). We have established quality standards for raw materials. Imported raw materials such as petrochemicals undergo quality checks, which confirm moisture content, weight of laminates and other important technical data prior to entering our foam production lines. We integrate quality checks into the manufacturing process at different stages. Quality and physical characteristics of our foam are regularly tested before being integrated into our finished mattress and furniture products, with regular ILD, tensile strength, elongation, resilience, airflow, compression, pounding and shear fatigue tests conducted post-foaming. Dimensional and visual inspections are conducted after the cutting process. We also conduct testing of finished products before packaging and shipping. We actively collect customer feedback and use it to identify any quality issues and guide improvements. We invest in technology and automation to enhance our quality control and assurance processes. This may include using machinery, sensors, data analysis, and automated testing equipment. Further, each product platform in furniture is tested and certified by external laboratories for a specific weight and cycle range."}, {"bbox": [147, 819, 1553, 1733], "category": "Table", "text": "<table><tr><td>Karl Fischer Titrator (Moisture content)</td><td>Universal Testing machine</td><td>Resilience Tester</td></tr><tr><td>Compression Set</td><td>Hardness Tester</td><td>Airflow Tester</td></tr></table>"}, {"bbox": [161, 880, 615, 1219], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [641, 880, 1092, 1219], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1168, 880, 1491, 1219], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [187, 1306, 588, 1694], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [671, 1306, 1065, 1702], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [1134, 1306, 1524, 1694], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [143, 1768, 459, 1801], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Returns and Replacements"}, {"bbox": [143, 1826, 1557, 1926], "category": "Text", "text": "Our return and replacements process aims to minimize costs and maximize the value of returned items.
