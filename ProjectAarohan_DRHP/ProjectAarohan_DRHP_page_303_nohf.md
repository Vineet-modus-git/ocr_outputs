**Annexure VI - Statement of Restated Adjustments to the Audited Consolidated Financial Information**

*(All amounts are in Rs. million, except share data and per share data, unless otherwise stated)*

**For the year ended 31 March 2024:**

2A(b) In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appears from our examination of those books except for the matters stated in the paragraph 2B(f) below on reporting under Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014.

2B(f) Based on our examination which included test checks, except for the instances mentioned below, the Company has used accounting softwares for maintaining its books of accounts, which have a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all the relevant transactions recorded in the respective softwares:

In respect of an accounting software used for maintaining sales records, purchases, fixed assets, inventories, general ledgers and other sub-ledgers, the feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility was not enabled at the database level to log any direct data changes and at the application level for certain changes which were performed by users having privileged access rights.

In respect of an accounting software used for maintaining payroll records, the Company has used an accounting software which is operated by a third-party software service provider. In the absence of relevant controls in the Service Organisation Control (SOC) reports, we are unable to comment whether audit trail (edit log) facility was enabled at the database level and operated throughout the year for all relevant transactions recorded in the software or whether there were any instances of the audit trail feature being tampered with.

Further, for the periods where the audit trail (edit log) facility was enabled and operated, we did not come across any instance of audit trail feature being tampered with.
