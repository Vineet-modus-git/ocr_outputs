We have strong capabilities in research and development ("R&D")-driven product designs and continuously enhance products based on customer feedback. Our product development process involves six steps: conceptualization (covering need identification, product design and financial analysis); consumer concept testing; prototyping and engineering; internal testing and production development; and finally a test launch, followed by a commercial launch. Backed by our in-house R&D and design capabilities, we will continue to introduce advanced and differentiated sleep solutions and as of June 30, 2025, our R&D team comprises 17 employees. For further details, see "- Our Business Operations - Product Development Process" on page 205.

Our product development process enables us to develop and test new products to meet evolving market demands. We initially produce small batches of new products to assess market demand. This approach enables us to understand customer interest before scaling up production, reducing inventory risks. Our comprehensive design process includes customer-centric design, market analysis, and the use of software tools. We also regularly review and study a wide range of design concepts from across the world, which helps us identify and select distinctive styles across different product categories. Our team of product designers and engineers work together closely to create products which are aesthetic, functional, durable, and cost-effective to manufacture.

Our comprehensive product portfolio and continuous product innovations have helped us grow our revenue and brand salience across customer segments. Our diversified product offering across mattresses, furniture, and foam under our own brand, enables us to cross-sell complementary products, up-sell higher-end products, and encourage repeat purchases through network effects.

**Strong brand equity, driven by a multi-pronged marketing approach**

We benefit from strong customer affinity and brand recognition, as one of the leading brands in the branded premium segment, which constitutes 80% of the overall premium market as of FY2025, according to the TKC Report. In addition, our brand equity was assessed in a study conducted by Kantar, an international market research company, in December 2024. The study highlighted that consumers' consideration of our brands is driven by trust, aspiration, and comfort. Our total brand awareness stood at 87%, and spontaneous awareness at 52%. Further, the average customer rating of our COCO Stores on a key mapping application, as of June 30, 2025 is 4.8/5, which is a strong testimony of our commitment to the consumer experience, according to the TKC Report.

Through our R&D driven product innovations, content-based marketing, and celebrity and influencer driven campaigns, we aim to create thought leadership, health awareness on the importance of sleep, and customer aspiration for premium mattresses. Several of our campaigns have been aimed at highlighting the awareness of the importance of sleep for health, productivity and well-being, such as our Energise product launch described below, as well as the importance of an orthopedic mattress for good spinal support.
