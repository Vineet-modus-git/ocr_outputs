accordance with this Ind AS when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment, otherwise, such items are classified as inventory.

If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

## b. Transition to Ind AS

The cost of property, plant and equipment on 1 April 2021, our date of transition to Ind AS, was determined with reference to its carrying value recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.

## c. Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to us and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other expenses on existing property, plant, and equipment, including day-to-day repair and maintenance expenditure are charged to the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred.

## d. Capital advances and Capital work in progress

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets. The costs of property, plant, and equipment, which are not ready for their intended use on such date, are disclosed as capital work in progress. The capital work-in-progress is carried at cost, comprising direct cost, related incidental expenses, and attributable interest. No depreciation is charged on the capital work in progress until the asset is ready for the intended use.

## e. Depreciation

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method (SLM) over the useful lives of assets estimated by our management. Freehold land is not depreciated. Based on an internal technical evaluation, our management believes that useful life as given below, which are different from those prescribed in Part C of schedule II of the Act, best represents the period over which our management expects to use these assets.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment acquired/disposed off during the year is recorded on a pro-rata basis with reference to the month of acquisition/disposal.

<table><thead><tr><td>Asset category</td><td>Management estimate of useful life (in years)</td><td>Useful life as per Schedule II (in years)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Office Equipments</td><td>3 to 5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Computers & its peripherals</td><td>3 to 6</td><td>3 to 6</td></tr><tr><td>Building</td><td>3 to 30</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical Equipment</td><td>2 to 10</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fixtures</td><td>3 to 10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold improvement</td><td>2 to 4</td><td>As per tenure of the lease</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and Machinery</td><td>2 to 15</td><td>15</td></tr></tbody></table>

The residual value, useful lives and the method of depreciation of property, plant and equipment's are reviewed at each reporting period end and adjusted prospectively if appropriate. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

## (vi) Goodwill, Intangible assets under development and other intangible assets

### Goodwill

Goodwill arising of business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred and the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of our cash-generating units
