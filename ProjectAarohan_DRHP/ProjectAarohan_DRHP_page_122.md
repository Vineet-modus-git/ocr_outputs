(iii) The presence of competition, which is considered a key factor as it may indicate existing demand.

### Proposed utilisation of Net Proceeds

As on date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Board of Directors pursuant to its resolution dated October 11, 2025, have approved the business expansion plan of opening 150 New COCO Stores across cities in India. Out of the 150 New COCO Stores, 120 New COCO Stores are proposed to be established utilising ₹ 504.40 million from the Net Proceeds in Financial Years 2027, 2028 and 2029 towards this Object.

Our Company proposes to set up 120 New COCO Stores across India, as set out below:

<table><thead><tr><td>Period</td><td>Opening targets</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Financial Year 2027</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Year 2028</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Year 2029</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>120</td></tr></tbody></table>

Consistent with our current practice of operating our COCO Stores from exclusively leased and sub-leased, or licensed premises, we will continue this approach for all proposed New COCO Stores. For further details, see “*Our Business - Properties*” on page 221. As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have not yet entered into any lease agreements for the specific properties where we intend to set up the New COCO Stores using the Net Proceeds. We intend to open our New COCO Stores in a mix of our existing locations as well as new locations within India, including locations such as Hyderabad, Telangana, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, Mumbai, Maharashtra, Pune, Maharashtra, New Delhi, Delhi, Bengaluru, Karnataka, Gurugram, Haryana, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and Kolkata, West Bengal. These locations are not exhaustive and may undergo changes. The final location of each of our New COCO Stores will be decided by our Company after a detailed and data-driven analysis of several critical factors, including market and demographic analysis, visibility and accessibility of the site, the presence of competition, and financial viability based on rent, fit-out costs, and projected revenues. The estimate of the number of stores to be set up is an internal management estimate based on current business needs. This plan may vary subject to compliance with applicable law and in light of factors such as property availability, business dynamics, brand recall, and other market considerations which may not be in our control.

### Estimated cost

#### Capital expenditure

As of June 30, 2025, the average size of our COCO Stores (aggregate area divided by number of active COCO Stores) is approximately 1,700 square feet of built-up area per store. In the future, we intend to open New COCO Stores of varied sizes, tailored to specific locations and market needs, based on our past experience and data-driven analysis. The size, number, and exact area of such proposed New COCO Stores may vary and will depend on various factors, including market and demographic analysis, availability of suitable locations, lease rentals, potential footfall, and competition within a given region. For the purpose of arriving at estimated costs below, we have considered an average size of approximately 2,000 square feet per New COCO Store (“Average Size”). While the individual store sizes may vary, the new COCO Stores are proposed to be set up on an overall aggregate area measuring approximately 240,000 square feet.

The estimated costs of setting up a New COCO Store of Average Size are based on (i) certificate dated October 15, 2025 from Architects IN, independent architect, for the purposes of certifying the costs associated with setting up of a New COCO Store of Average Size; (ii) valid quotations obtained by our Company, from various contractors/vendors, details of which are set out below; and (iii) our management and internal estimates for specifications and item requirements, based on our prior experience of setting-up similar COCO Stores, prior to the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The quotations obtained by our Company is based on a New COCO Store of Average Size and is location agnostic.

The estimated capital expenditure for setting up the New COCO Stores of Average Size in the Financial Year 2026 is as follows:
