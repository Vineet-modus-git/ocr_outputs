### Laws related to our Business

#### Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and the rules made thereunder ("Consumer Protection Act" or "CPA")

The Consumer Protection Act, which repeals and supersedes the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, has been enacted with the objective of providing more efficient and expedited mechanisms for the redressal of consumer grievances. The Consumer Protection Act is intended, inter alia, to promote and safeguard the interests of consumers in respect of deficiencies or defects associated with goods or services, and to secure the rights of consumers against unfair trade practices that may be adopted by manufacturers, service providers, or traders. Furthermore, the definition of "consumer" under the Consumer Protection Act has been significantly broadened to include individuals engaging in offline as well as online transactions, whether such transactions are conducted through electronic means, tele-shopping, direct selling, or multi-level marketing channels. The definition of e-commerce was included in the CPA and the definitions of consumers and advertisements were broadened (when compared to the erstwhile Consumer Protection Act, 1986) to ensure that consumers engaging in online shopping are afforded the same rights and protections as those purchasing goods or services through traditional channels. The CPA established the Central Consumer Protection Authority to investigate violations of consumer rights, unfair trade practices, and penalize misleading advertisements, strengthening enforcement mechanisms. Further, the legislation and its companion rules (which undergo regular administrative updates) provide for the constitution of consumer dispute redressal forums and commissions for the effective resolution of consumer grievances. In addition to granting compensation and issuing remedial orders, these forums and commissions, in cases involving misleading or false advertisements, possess the authority to impose imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, and to levy fines which may extend up to â‚¹1 million.

#### The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 ("Consumer Protection Rules")

The Central Government has notified the Consumer Protection Rules, in exercise of the powers vested under the Consumer Protection Act. The Consumer Protection Rules delineate the specific duties and liabilities of e-commerce entities engaged in the marketing and sale of goods and services to consumers via online platforms. The Consumer Protection Rules are applicable to all electronic retailers, incorporated in India or abroad, offering goods and services to Indian consumers. The Rules empower the Central Government to take action against unfair trade practices within the e-commerce sector. E-tailers are mandated to facilitate easy returns, effectively redress customer grievances, and refrain from discriminating against merchants operating on their platforms. The Consumer Protection Rules extend to all goods and services bought or sold through any digital platform, covering all e-commerce models, including marketplace and inventory-based models and all forms of e-commerce retail, encompassing multi-channel single brand retailers as well as single brand retailers operating in single or multiple formats. The Consumer Protection Rules are equally applicable to foreign-registered e-commerce entities offering goods and services to consumers in India.

#### Furniture (Quality Control) Order, 2025 ("Furniture (Quality Control) Order")

The Central Government has issued the Furniture (Quality Control) Order pursuant to the powers conferred by the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 2016. The Furniture (Quality Control) Order is intended to regulate and monitor the quality and safety standards of furniture products manufactured within India. The Furniture (Quality Control) Order was notified on February 13, 2025, and shall come into force with effect from February 13, 2026. Under the terms of the Furniture (Quality Control) Order, furniture manufacturers are required to ensure compliance with the Bureau of Indian Standards ("BIS") and mandatorily secure the appropriate certifications for the sale of specified furniture products, which include work chairs, general purpose chairs and stools, tables and desks, storage units, beds, and bunk beds. The BIS, functioning under the aegis of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, is vested with the authority to certify certain designated furniture products currently produced and sold by entities in India. Any failure to adhere to these regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of penalties and curtailment of sales.
