## Borrowing powers of our Board of Directors

Pursuant to resolutions passed by our Board and the Shareholders at their meeting each dated September 9, 2025, our Board is authorized to borrow from time to time as they may deem fit, any sum or sums of money up to â‚¹ 5,000.00 million on such terms and conditions as the Board may deem fit, whether the same may be secured or unsecured and if secured, whether by way of mortgage, charge hypothecation, lien, pledge or otherwise in any way whatsoever, on, over or in any respect of all, or any of the company's assets and effects or properties whether movable or immovable or stock in process and debts and advances, notwithstanding that the money to be borrowed together with the money already borrowed by the Company (apart from the temporary loans obtained from the Company's bankers in the ordinary course of business) and remaining un-discharged at any given point of time, exceeds the aggregate, for the time being, of the paid-up share capital, free reserves, that is to say, reserves not set apart for any specific purpose and securities premium.

## Corporate governance

The provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations with respect to corporate governance will be applicable to us immediately upon the listing of the Equity Shares with the Stock Exchanges. We are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations, and the Companies Act, in respect of corporate governance including the constitution of our Board and committees thereof and formulation and adoption of policies. The corporate governance framework is based on an effective independent Board, separating the Board's supervisory role from the executive management team and constitution of the Board committees, as required under law.

As on the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, our Board comprises eight Directors including one Chairman and Managing Director, three Whole-time Directors and four Independent Directors, including two women Independent Directors. In compliance with Section 152 of the Companies Act, not less than two-thirds of the Directors (excluding Independent Directors and Managing Director) are liable to retire by rotation.

The Board of Directors function either as a full board, or through various committees constituted to oversee specific operational areas.
