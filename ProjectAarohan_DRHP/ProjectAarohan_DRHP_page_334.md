### A. Description of share based payment arrangement

#### i. Employees Stock Option Scheme 2019

During the financial year 2019-20, the Company introduced the Duroflex Employee Stock Option Scheme ('the Scheme' or "ESOS"). As per the Scheme, the ESOS Committee grants options to full time employees of the Company or a director of the Company, whether a whole time Director or not, excluding the promoters. The vesting period of the option range from one to five years from the date of grant. The scheme was an equity settled scheme. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.

Options granted under the Scheme can be exercised within the prescribed time limit mentioned in the exercise notice issued by the ESOS committee within a reasonable period prior to the occurrence of a liquidity event. Liquidity event is defined as:

a) initial public offer of the shares in the Company for listing on a recognised stock exchange;

b) divestment of entire stake held by the investor in the Company by way of sale to an identical buyer; or

c) such other event as may be determined by the ESOS committee from time to time.

#### ii. Employees Stock Option Scheme 2023

During the financial year 2022-23, the Company introduced the Duroflex Employee Stock Option Plan 1 and Plan 2 ('the Schemes' or "ESOP Plans"). As per the Scheme, the ESOS Committee grants options to permanent employees of the Company or its subsidiary or a director of the Company or its subsidiary, whether a whole time Director or not, excluding the promoters & Independent directors. The vesting period of the option range from one to four years from the date of grant. The scheme is an equity settled scheme. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.

Options granted under the Scheme can be exercised within the prescribed time limit mentioned in the exercise notice issued by the ESOS committee within a reasonable period prior to the occurrence of a liquidity event. Liquidity event shall be deemed to include:

a) a sale of at least 50% (fifty percent) of the shares held by the Promoters of the Company to any third party;

b) a sale, lease, license or other transfer of all or substantially all the Company's assets (including by way of a sale of any Group Company or assets of Group Company).

c) Initial Public Offer (IPO) whereby the shares of the Company get listed on any recognized stock exchange; and.

d) any other event that can be termed as a Liquidity Event as per the discretion of the Board.

The Company has defined graded vesting for ESOP plans. Under Plan 1, options will vest over a period of 4 years considering an annual year from date of grant subject to achievement of performance criterial as may be determined by the ESOS committee. Under Plan 2 options will vest over a period of 4 years on annual basis considering the date of grant.

The schemes mentioned above are equity settled schemes and hence the Group has followed the equity settled method of accounting of the options.

### B. Measurement of fair values

#### i. Fair Value Methodology

The fair value at grant date is determined using the Black Scholes valuation option-pricing model (except for Plan 1 under new ESOP scheme 2023) which takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.

The fair value at grant date is determined using the Monte-carlo valuation option-pricing model for Plan 1 under new ESOP scheme 2023, which takes into account the possible prices of the underlying asset (EBITDA) to compute the discounted expected option payoffs.

#### ii. The key assumptions used in for calculating fair value of options under the scheme as on the date of grant are as follows:
