technology driven and omnichannel ecosystem. The home and furnishings industry in India is competitive, with a mix of large
multinational companies, as well as regional and local companies in each of the product categories that we offer. Some of our
key peers include Sheela Foam Limited, Wakefit, Peps Industries, The Sleep Company. (Source: TKC Report).
