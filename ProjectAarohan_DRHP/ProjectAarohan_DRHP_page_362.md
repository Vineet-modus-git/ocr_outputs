Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at the reporting date that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is included in the following notes:

- Note 3 and 7 - useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;

- Note 41 - measurement of share-based payments: Fair value of option at the grant date;

- Note 30 - provision for warranties;

- Note 39 - recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which deductible temporary differences and tax loss carried forward can be utilized;

- Note 40 - measurement of ECL allowance for trade and finance receivables, loans and contract assets: key assumptions in determining the weighted-average loss rate;

- Note 40 - fair value measurement of financial instruments;

- Note 42 - recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources;

- Note 45 - measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions;

- Note 28 - refund liabilities;

- Note 5 - investment property; and

- Note 7 - impairment test of intangible assets and goodwill: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts, including the recoverability of development costs.

*Current and non-current classification*

Based on the time involved between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents, we have identified twelve months as our operating cycle for determining current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

*Measurement of fair values*

Certain of our accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

We have an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. We regularly review significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information is used to measure the fair values, then we assess the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of the Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.

Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, we use observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into a different level of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
