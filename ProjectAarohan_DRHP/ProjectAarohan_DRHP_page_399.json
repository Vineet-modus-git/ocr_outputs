The Office of the Joint Commissioner Intelligence Salem, Commercial Tax Department, Government of Tamil Nadu (\"Department\") issued a show cause cum demand notice dated February 28, 2024 (\"SCN\") to our Company (\"Noticee\") under Section 74(9) and related penalty provisions of the CGST and TNGST Acts for the period April 2022 to March 2023, alleging inter alia: (i) alleged excess availment of input tax credit (\"ITC\") in GSTR-3B compared to GSTR-2A, resulting in excess ITC having been claimed; (ii) stock difference, where discrepancies between book stock and physical stock identified during inspection were treated as taxable, attracting reversal and penalty; (iii) mismatches between GST returns and e-way bill data (for both inward and outward supplies), leading to alleged excess ITC claims or unsubstantiated turnovers. The notice ultimately assessed an aggregate demand of ₹23.30 million exclusive of applicable interest and penalty (\"Demand\"). The Noticee submitted replies dated April 22, 2024, and May 30, 2024 (\"Replies\"), contesting the Demand on various grounds, inter alia, that (a) there was no wilful misstatement, suppression, or fraud to justify invocation of Section 74, and that all discrepancies resulted from bona fide timing or procedural issues, with all information and cooperation provided to the Department; (b) ITC claimed in GSTR-3B was substantiated and any differences with GSTR-2A were due to timing, procedural aspects, or legitimate reconciliation (such as credit claim deferral), and any demand solely based on GSTR-2A was erroneous; (c) in the case of stock differences, the quantum in question was minor (less than 0.05% of overall tax), with no intention to evade and without sufficient supporting details or legal grounds for treating genuine timing differences as taxable supplies; (d) e-way bill and GST returns data mismatches were procedural, explained largely by service transactions or invoices below the statutory threshold, and did not justify demand in the absence of intent to evade or actual revenue loss; and (e) interest liability, if any, was dependent entirely on substantiated tax liability, and no further interest could be justified where tax was not due. Pursuant to adjudication order dated May 30, 2024 (\"Order\"), the Department acknowledged and dropped demands related to e-way bill mismatches where proper documentation and explanation were provided but confirmed demand amounting to ₹55.69 million relating to ITC mismatch and stock differences along with associated interest and penalty. The Noticee has filed an appeal dated August 29, 2024, seeking a complete set aside of the Order. Noticee has paid the mandatory pre-deposit of ₹2.33 million, being 10% of the disputed tax amount. The matter is currently pending.\n4. The Office of the Assistant Commissioner, CGST & Central Excise, Division IV, Bhiwandi, Maharashtra (\"Department\") issued a show cause cum demand notice dated May 27, 2024 (\"SCN\") to our Company (\"Noticee\") under Section 61 and penalties under Section 73(9) and Section 122(2)(a) of the CGST Act and Maharashtra Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 for the period April 2019 to March 2020. The SCN alleged inter alia: (i) short payment of tax in GSTR-3B when compared with GSTR-1, resulting in alleged under-discharge of self-assessed output tax liability; (ii) short payment of GST under the reverse charge mechanism (\"RCM\"), specifically where the RCM tax disclosed in GSTR-3B was less than the liability identified in GSTR-2A; (iii) excess availment of input tax credit (\"ITC\") in GSTR-3B as compared to GSTR-2A, leading to the reversal of such ITC; (iv) ITC claimed in respect of invoices issued by suppliers who had not filed their GSTR-3B returns, resulting in ineligible credit; (v) late filing of GSTR-1 for May 2019, attracting statutory late fees; (vi) a shortfall between outward tax declared in GSTR-3B and liability reflected in e-way bill data, resulting in additional alleged tax liability; and (vii) a mismatch between tax liability declared in GSTR-9 and GSTR-3B, leading to demand of the differential amount. The Noticee submitted a reply dated August 26, 2024 (\"Reply\"), contesting the Demand on the grounds, inter alia, that (a) issues relating to alleged excess ITC were already covered and settled in a previous audit concluded by the CGST Audit Commissionerate, and therefore, parallel proceedings violate settled law; (b) the alleged e-way bill discrepancy was a result of a clerical error as no supply actually took place against the disputed e-way bill, and documentation was provided to substantiate this position; (c) in respect of short-paid RCM liability, tax was paid under the correct head (CGST/SGST instead of IGST), resulting in a revenue-neutral situation; and (d) the difference between GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and GSTR-9 had either been rectified in annual returns or resulted from timing/procedural matters, without intention to evade tax. Pursuant to the adjudication order dated August 29, 2024 (\"Order\"), the Department confirmed tax, interest, and penalty in respect of the ITC mismatch, e-way bill discrepancies, RCM and other issues, but no evidence was found of fraud, wilful misstatement, or suppression. The total demand assessed in the Order, amounted to ₹13.44 million inclusive of applicable interest and penalty (\"Demand\").
