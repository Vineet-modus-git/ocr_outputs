Notes:

(1) Weighted average return on Net Worth = Aggregate of year-wise weighted Return on Net Worth divided by the aggregate of weights i.e. [(Return on Net Worth x Weight) for each year] / [Total of weights]

(2) Return on Net Worth (%) is computed as profit/(loss) for the period/year divided by Net Worth as at the end of the period/year. As per Regulation 2(1)(hh) of SEBI ICDR Regulations, as amended, Net Worth means the aggregate value of the paid-up share capital and all reserves created out of the profits and securities premium account and debit or credit balance of profit and loss account, after deducting the aggregate value of the accumulated losses, deferred expenditure and miscellaneous expenditure not written off, as per the restated consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, but does not include reserves created out of revaluation of assets, write-back of depreciation and amalgamation. Further, Net Worth is calculated as sum of equity share capital and other equity excluding capital reserve, other comprehensive income and demerger deficit reserve.

Notes:

(1) Net Asset Value per equity share represents Net Worth at the end of the period/year divided by number of equity shares outstanding at the end of the period/year end. Number of equity shares outstanding at the end of the period/year is an aggregate of number of equity shares considering dilutive number of shares and adjusted for equity shares issued due to stock split during the period/year and bonus issue of equity shares.

(2) As per Regulation 2(1)(hh) of SEBI ICDR Regulations, as amended, Net Worth means the aggregate value of the paid-up share capital and all reserves created out of the profits and securities premium account and debit or credit balance of profit and loss account, after deducting the aggregate value of the accumulated losses, deferred expenditure and miscellaneous expenditure not written off, as per the restated consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, but does not include reserves created out of revaluation of assets, write-back of depreciation and amalgamation. Further, Net Worth is calculated as sum of equity share capital and other equity excluding capital reserve, other comprehensive income and demerger deficit reserve.
