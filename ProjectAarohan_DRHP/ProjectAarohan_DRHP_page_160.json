Developments in high-resilience foam, antimicrobial formulations, and hybrid blends are enabling the introduction of premium-grade foam products. In parallel, global trends around recyclable and bio-based PU foam variants are shaping long-term R&D directions in the Indian market, although large-scale commercialisation remains limited. An illustration of this shift is Duroflex, which is the only leading Indian mattress player to obtain CertiPUR-US certification. This certification ensures that the company's foams meet strict international standards on content, emissions, and durability, and are free from harmful chemicals such as ozone depleters, heavy metals, or formaldehyde. The adoption of such certified materials highlights how Indian producers are gradually aligning with global best practices in material innovation."}, {"bbox": [145, 1348, 1558, 1448], "category": "Text", "text": "**Diversification of End-Use Applications:** Beyond traditional sectors like bedding and furniture, PU foam is increasingly being used in diverse applications such as acoustic insulation, footwear, thermo-ware, and industrial packaging.
