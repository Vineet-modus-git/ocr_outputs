While our management and the Board of Directors have assessed the incident as an isolated incident and have implemented recommendations from the investigation report, there remains a risk that similar misconduct could occur in the future. Fraudulent and unauthorised conduct by our employees could also bind us to transactions that present significant risks to us. As a result, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, brand and reputational damage or financial harm. It is not always possible to deter fraud or misconduct by employees and the precautions we take and the systems we have put in place to prevent and deter such activities may not be effective in all cases. Further, we employ third parties for certain operations and accordingly, we are exposed to the risk of theft and embezzlement. In addition, we may be subject to regulatory or other proceedings in connection with such acts by our employees, which could adversely affect our goodwill. Even if we identify instances of fraud, misappropriation, unauthorised acts and misconduct by our representatives and employees and pursue legal recourse or file claims, we cannot assure you that we will recover any amounts lost through such instances of fraud, misappropriation, unauthorised acts and misconduct by our representatives and employees.
