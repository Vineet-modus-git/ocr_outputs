The change in inventories of finished goods, semi-finished goods and stock in trade was ₹ 37.77 million in Fiscal 2024 compared to ₹ (7.65) million in Fiscal 2025, primarily due to increasing inventory levels as at March 31, 2025, in line with increased revenues in Fiscal 2025.

### Employee benefits expense

Employee benefits expense decreased by 2.00% from ₹ 986.65 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 966.91 million in Fiscal 2025, primarily due to a decline in staff welfare expenses from ₹ 75.61 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 52.31 million in Fiscal 2025, as we spent more on employee related events in Fiscal 2024, primarily an event to commemorate our foundation (which is a non-recurring event) and a decrease in share-based payment expense from ₹ 15.38 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 7.20 million in Fiscal 2025, because certain vesting conditions of stock options were not met.

### Finance costs

Finance costs decreased by 28.17% from ₹ 97.36 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 69.93 million in Fiscal 2025, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost on - (i) borrowings from banks from ₹ 42.40 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 18.44 million in Fiscal 2025, primarily due to lower average balances of long-term borrowings on account of repayment such borrowings as per their repayment schedules; (ii) lease liabilities from ₹ 41.76 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 39.60 million in Fiscal 2025 as we are approaching the expiry of the lock-in period on various leases leading to a lower recognition of interest expense on lease liabilities; and (iii) other borrowing costs from ₹ 5.00 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 2.79 million in Fiscal 2025.
