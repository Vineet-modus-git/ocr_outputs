## 2 Material accounting policies (continued)

### xi) Leases

#### A) Group as a Lessee

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

To assess where the Group has the right to control the use of identified assets, the Group assesses whether the:

(i) the contract involves the use of identified assets,

(ii) whether the Group has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of assets throughout the period of use and

(iii) whether the Group has the right to direct the use of assets.

##### a. Right-of-use

The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of Right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial cost incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date. The Right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term basis over a lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

##### b. Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, including amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantee. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

##### c. Short-term leases

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less from the commencement date and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term.

#### B) Group as a Lessor

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

When the Group as an intermediate lessor enters into an intermediate finance lease, it derecognises the right-of-use asset under the head lease which it transfers to the sub lessee, recognises the net investment in the sublease as an asset, recognises the difference between the right-of-use asset and the net investment as a gain or loss and continue to recognise the lease liability, i.e., the lease payments owed to the head lessor, for the head lease. Over the sublease term, the intermediate lessor recognises the interest income from the sublease and the interest expense for the head lease.

### xii) Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs include interest, amortization of ancillary costs incurred and exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost. Borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognized as expense in the period/year in which they are incurred.

### xiii) Share issue expenses

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares are adjusted with the securities premium.

### xiv) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (including cost of raw materials and components, non-refundable taxes and other overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition) and estimated net realizable value after providing for obsolescence, where appropriate. The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on an item-by-item basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Net realizable value of semi-finished goods is determined with reference to the selling prices of related finished goods. Raw materials, packing materials and other supplies held for use in production of inventories are not written down below cost except in cases where material prices have declined, and it is estimated that the cost of the finished goods will exceed their net realizable value.

Cost of raw materials and packing materials are determined on a weighted average basis.

Stores and spares are determined on a First in First Out basis.

Semi-finished goods is determined at material cost and an appropriate share of production overheads.

Finished goods are determined at material cost and an appropriate share of production overheads.

Stock in trade are determined at purchase cost.

Obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are identified at the time of periodic physical verification of inventories and where necessary, a markdown is made for such inventories.
