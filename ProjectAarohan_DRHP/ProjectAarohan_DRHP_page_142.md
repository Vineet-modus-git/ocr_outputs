**Subject:** Statement of possible special tax benefits ("the Statement") available to Duroflex Limited (*Formerly known as Duroflex Private Limited*) ("the Company"), its shareholders and its material subsidiary audited by us, prepared in accordance with the requirement under Schedule VI - Part A - Clause (9) (L) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, as amended ("the ICDR Regulations")

This report is issued in accordance with the terms of our engagement letter dated 7 August 2025 and subsequent addendum dated 6
October 2025.

We hereby report that the enclosed Annexure II prepared by the Company, initialed by us for identification purpose, states the possible special tax benefits available to the Company, its shareholders and its material subsidiary audited by us ("Material Subsidiary"), which is defined in Annexure I (List of Material Subsidiary Audited by Us and Considered As Part Of The Statement), under direct and indirect taxes (together the "Tax Laws"), presently in force in India as on the signing date, which are defined in Annexure III (List of Direct and Indirect Tax Laws ('Tax Laws')) prepared by the Company, initialed by us for identification purpose. These possible special tax benefits are dependent on the Company, its shareholders and its Material Subsidiary fulfilling the conditions prescribed under the relevant provisions of the Tax Laws. Hence, the ability of the Company, its shareholders and its Material Subsidiary to derive these possible special tax benefits is dependent upon their fulfilling such conditions, which is based on business imperatives the Company and its Material Subsidiary may face in the future and accordingly, the Company, its shareholders and its Material Subsidiary may or may not choose to fulfill.

The benefits discussed in the enclosed Annexure II cover the possible special tax benefits available to the Company, its shareholders and its Material Subsidiary and do not cover any general tax benefits available to the Company, its shareholders and its Material Subsidiary. Further, the preparation of the enclosed Annexure II and its contents is the responsibility of the management of the Company. We were informed that the Statement is only intended to provide general information to the investors and is neither designed nor intended to be a substitute for professional tax advice. In view of the individual nature of the tax consequences and the changing Tax Laws, each investor is advised to consult his or her own tax consultant with respect to the specific tax implications arising out of their participation in the proposed initial public offering of equity shares of the Company (the "Proposed Offer") particularly in view of the fact that certain recently enacted legislation may not have a direct legal precedent or may have a different interpretation on the possible special tax benefits, which an investor can avail. Neither we are suggesting nor advising the investors to invest money based on the Statement.

We conducted our examination in accordance with the Guidance Note on Reports or Certificates for Special Purposes (Revised 2016) ("Guidance Note") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The Guidance Note requires that we comply with ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Our scope of work did not involve performance of any audit test in this context of our examination. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

We have complied with the relevant applicable requirements of the Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements.

We do not express any opinion or provide any assurance as to whether:

i) the Company, its shareholders and its Material Subsidiary will continue to obtain these possible special tax benefits in future; or
