Growth has been fuelled by the rise of direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, online marketplaces, and changing consumer behaviours. E-commerce caters primarily to urban, convenience-seeking, digitally savvy consumers who value product variety, transparency, and doorstep delivery. Online channels are particularly effective in reaching Tier 2/3 cities where offline brand presence may be limited. Duroflex (comprising Duroflex and Sleepyhead brands) is estimated to be among the top two players in the e-commerce modern mattress market as of FY2025. The company's queen-size mattresses have an average rating of 4.3 on India's leading two horizontal online marketplaces."}]
