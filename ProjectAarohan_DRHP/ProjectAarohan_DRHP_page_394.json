The Deputy Director of Industrial Safety and Health, Hosur (\"Complainant\"), filed two criminal complaints on May 10, 2023, (\"Complaints\") before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Krishnagiri (\"Magistrate\") against Satti Jose, the erstwhile Manager of our Company (collectively, the \"Petitioner\"). The Complaints alleged contraventions under Section 41 of the Factories Act, 1948, (\"Factories Act\") read with Rule 61E of the Tamil Nadu Factories Rules, 1950, concerning three accidents involving contract workmen that occurred on March 24, 2015, May 18, 2015, and July 21, 2016. Following the issuance of summons by the Magistrate, the Petitioner filed a criminal original petition dated March 19, 2024, before the High Court of Judicature at Madras (\"High Court\") under Section 482 of the CrPC, seeking to quash the Complaints. The principal ground for the petition is that the Complaints are statutorily time-barred under Section 106 of the Factories Act, which mandates that a complaint must be filed within three months from the date the alleged offence came to the knowledge of the inspector. The Petitioner contends that the Complainant possessed knowledge of the accidents when the statutory Form 18 intimations were duly submitted in 2015 and 2016, not from the date of a subsequent inspection on February 16, 2023. The High Court, by its order dated April 1, 2024, held that a prima facie case has been made out by the Petitioner. Consequently, the High Court granted an interim stay of the proceedings of the Complaints before the Magistrate until further orders and dispensed with the personal appearance of the Petitioner for the present.
