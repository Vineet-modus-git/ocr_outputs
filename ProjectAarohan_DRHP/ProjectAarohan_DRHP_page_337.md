In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group's capital Management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing during the period/year ended 30 June 2025, 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the period/year ended 30 June 2025, 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

**(b) Defined benefit plans**

The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan in India, governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. It entitles an employee, who has rendered at least five years of continuous service, to gratuity at the rate of fifteen days wages for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months, based on the rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned. The plan is managed through Insurance Companies under a defined benefit plan. The present value of obligation is determined based on actuarial valuation using the Projected unit credit method.

The Group is exposed to various risks in providing the above gratuity benefit which are as follows:

**Interest Rate risk:** The plan exposes the Group to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an increase in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in financial statements).

**Liquidity Risk:** This is the risk that the Group is not able to meet the short-term gratuity payouts. This may arise due to non availability of enough cash / cash equivalent to meet the liabilities or holding of illiquid assets not being sold in time.

**Salary Escalation Risk:** The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.

**Demographic Risk:** The Group has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Group is exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.

**Regulatory Risk:** Gratuity benefit is paid in accordance with the requirements of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (as amended from time to time). There is a risk of change in regulations requiring higher gratuity payouts (e.g. Increase in the maximum limit on gratuity of Rs. 20,00,000).

Note: The above is a standard list of risk exposures in providing the gratuity benefit and not exhaustive list.
