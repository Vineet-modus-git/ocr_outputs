Our Company was initially incorporated as 'Duroflex Coir Industries Private Limited' as a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956, pursuant to a certificate of incorporation dated November 9, 1981, issued by the Registrar of Companies at Kerala ("RoC at Kerala"). Our Company was subsequently converted into a public limited company, pursuant to a resolution passed by our Board on November 17, 1995, and a special resolution passed by our Shareholders on December 11, 1995, resulting in the change of our Company's name to 'Duroflex Coir Industries Limited'. A fresh certificate of incorporation dated December 11, 1995, reflecting this change was issued by the RoC at Kerala. Subsequently, the name of our Company was changed from 'Duroflex Coir Industries Limited' to 'Duroflex Limited' pursuant to a resolution passed by our Board on November 17, 1995, and a special resolution passed by our Shareholders on December 11, 1995. A fresh certificate of incorporation dated March 8, 1996, was accordingly issued by the RoC at Kerala. Thereafter, our Company was re-converted to a private limited company, pursuant to a resolution passed by our Board on September 1, 2001, and a special resolution passed by our Shareholders on September 29, 2001, which resulted in the name change to 'Duroflex Private Limited'. The RoC at Kerala issued a fresh certificate of incorporation dated July 29, 2003. Subsequently, our Company was once again converted into a public limited company, pursuant to a resolution dated September 9, 2025, passed by our Board and a special resolution passed by our Shareholders on September 9, 2025, with the name changed to 'Duroflex Limited'. The Registrar of Companies, Central Processing Centre, issued a fresh certificate of incorporation dated September 17, 2025, reflecting this conversion and name change.
