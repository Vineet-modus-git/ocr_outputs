We engaged a firm of independent practicing company secretaries, HVS & Associates, Company Secretaries, that conducted a physical search of our records at the offices of the RoC and have issued a report on such search dated October 14, 2025 (the "**RoC Search Report**"). However, we have not been able to retrieve such documents at the Company's premises and from the RoC digital records, and accordingly, have relied on the RoC Search Report and other supporting documents available in our records, including the resolutions passed by our Board or Shareholders in their meetings, as applicable and statutory registers of the Company. For further details, see "*Capital Structure – Notes to the capital structure – Share capital history of our Company – Equity share capital*" on page 86. Further, our Company has sent a letter dated October 14, 2025 to the Registrar of Companies, Kerala at Ernakulum, informing them about our inability to trace the corporate regulatory filings and records required to be filed or filed as above with them. As of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, no legal proceedings or regulatory action has been initiated by any regulatory or statutory authority (including the RoC) in respect of the untraceable corporate regulatory filings and records. However, we cannot assure you that no proceedings may be initiated in this regard in the future.
