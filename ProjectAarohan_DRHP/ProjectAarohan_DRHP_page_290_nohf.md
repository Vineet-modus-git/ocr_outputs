## 2 Material accounting policies (continued)

### vi) Goodwill, Intangible assets under development and other intangible assets (continued)

#### b. Other intangible assets

##### i. Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. An intangible asset is recognised only if it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition, other intangible assets, including those acquired by the Group in a business combination and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of an intangible asset is recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

##### ii. Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

##### iii. Amortisation

Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognised as depreciation and amortisation expense in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Goodwill is not amortised.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><td>Asset category</td><td>Useful life of the asset (In years)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Computer Software</td><td>4 to 6</td></tr><tr><td>Website</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table>

Amortization method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted if appropriate.

#### c. Intangible assets under development

Development expenditure is capitalized as part of the cost of the resulting intangible asset only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognized in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.

### vii) Investment property

Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when there is a change in use or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the property is derecognized.

The investment property includes land and buildings held by the Group. Depreciation on building is provided over its useful life using the straight-line method (SLM), in a manner similar to PPE and no depreciation on the land is recorded in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

<table><thead><tr><td>Asset category</td><td>Useful life of the asset (In years)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Building</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table>

The fair values of the investment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values is determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.

### viii) Impairment

#### a. Non-financial Assets

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Intangible assets under development and Goodwill are tested annually for impairment.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

The recoverable amount of an individual asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed. In respect of other assets for which impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, the Group reviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
