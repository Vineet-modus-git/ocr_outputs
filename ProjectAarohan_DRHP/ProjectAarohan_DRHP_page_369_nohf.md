- it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.

We measure loss allowances at an amount of lifetime expected credit losses, except for the following, which are measured as twelve month expected credit losses: -

- debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and

- other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instruments) has not increased materially since initial recognition.

We consider a financial asset to be in default when:

- the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to us in full, without recourse by us to actions such as realising security (if any is held).

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when we have no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with our procedures for recovery of amounts due.

## Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of assets.

### (ix) Employee benefits

#### Short term employee benefits

Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are classified as short-term employee benefits and are measured on an undiscounted basis. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus etc., which are to be paid in exchange for the employee services and are recognised as an expense in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the employee renders the related service.

#### Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions to a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. We make specified monthly contributions towards the government administered provident fund scheme. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the periods during which the related services are rendered by employees.

#### *Provident fund*

Contribution towards provident fund for certain employees is made to the regulatory authorities, where we have no further obligations. Such benefits are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as we do not carry any further obligations, apart from the contributions made on a monthly basis.

#### Defined benefit plans

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. Our net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for us, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan ('the asset ceiling'). To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. We determine the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. This rate is applied on the net defined benefit liability (asset), both as determined at the start of the annual reporting period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
