**Operational Benchmarking**

The mattress and foam industry in India is a fast-evolving sector driven by increasing consumer awareness around health and wellness, rising disposable incomes, and a growing preference for comfort-centric and orthopedic bedding solutions underscoring branded products within the organized sectors. The industry primarily comprises two key segments: mattresses (including coir, foam, spring, latex and hybrid varieties) and PU foam, which finds applications in mattresses, furniture, automotive products, and packaging. Although the unbranded play still holds a large share, particularly in foam production and low-cost mattresses, the branded segment is rapidly expanding with very few players like Duroflex, Sheela Foam etc. having capabilities to manufacture both foam and mattresses led by product innovation, better consumer outreach, and digital transformation. Legacy brands like Sleepwell and Duroflex are among the earliest established branded players in the mattress industry and remain dominant players across both mattresses and PU foam backed by integrated manufacturing and extensive retail networks. On the other hand, a new wave of direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands such as Wakefit, and The Sleep Company has disrupted the market with competitive pricing, strong digital marketing strategies, and innovations like smart grid technology and roll-packed mattresses to attract modern consumers.
