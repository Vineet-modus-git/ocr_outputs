It also mandates body corporates to adopt a privacy policy, to obtain consent from data subjects for collecting or transferring their sensitive personal data or information and intimate them about recipients of such collected data, as a mechanism of establishing a robust security standard. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Intermediary Rules”) requires intermediaries receiving, storing, transmitting or providing any service with respect to electronic messages to not knowingly host, publish, transmit, select or modify any information prohibited under these IT Intermediary Rules and to disable hosting, publishing, transmission, selection or modification of such information once they become aware of it, as well as specifying the due diligence to be observed by intermediaries. The IT Intermediary Rules also make it mandatory for an intermediary to publish, the privacy policy, rules and regulations, and user agreement for access or usage of the intermediary’s computer resource by any person on its website, and also establish a grievance redressal mechanism. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny around the world."}, {"bbox": [144, 638, 1560, 864], "category": "Text", "text": "Uncertainty in the applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change in, governing law, regulation or policy, including by reason of an absence, or a limited body, of administrative or judicial precedent may be time consuming as well as costly for us to resolve and may impact the viability of our current businesses or restrict our ability to grow our businesses in the future.
