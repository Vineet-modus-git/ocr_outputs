holder for the time being of the share or to the person entitled thereto by reason of their death or insolvency or otherwise.

No Member shall exercise any voting right in respect of any shares registered in his name on which any calls or other sums presently payable by them have not been paid, or in regard to which the Company has exercised any right of lien.

29. VALIDITY OF SALE

To give effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer. Ute purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall their title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings with reference to the sale.

30. VALIDITY OF COMPANY'S RECEIPT

The receipt for the consideration (if any) given for the share on the sale thereof shall (if necessary, to execution of an instrument of transfer or a transfer by relevant system, as the case maybe) constitute a good title to the share and the purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the share.

31. APPLICATION OF SALE PROCEEDS

The proceeds of any such sale shall be received by the Company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable and the residue, if any, shall (subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.

32. OUTSIDER'S LIEN NOT TO AFFECT COMPANY'S LIEN

In exercising its lien, the Company shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any share as the absolute owner thereof and accordingly shall not (except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or unless required by law) be bound to recognise any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share on the part of any other person, whether a creditor of the registered holder or otherwise. The Company's lien shall prevail notwithstanding that it has received notice of any such claim.

33. PROVISIONS AS TO LIEN TO APPLY MUTATIS MUTANDIS TO DEBENTURES, ETC.

The provisions of these Articles relating to lien shall *mutatis mutandis* apply to any other securities, including debentures, of the Company.

CALLS ON SHARES

34. BOARD TO HAVE RIGHT TO MAKE CALLS ON SHARES

The Board may subject to the provisions of the Act and any other applicable law, from time to time, make such calls as it thinks fit upon the Members in respect of all monies unpaid on the shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by premium) and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times. Provided that no call shall exceed one-fourth of the nominal value of the share or be payable at less than one (1) month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call. A call may be revoked or postponed at the discretion of the Board. The power to call on shares shall not be delegated to any other person except with the approval of the Shareholders' in a General Meeting and as maybe permitted by law.

35. NOTICE FOR CALL

Each Member shall, subject to receiving at least fourteen (14) days' notice specifying the time or times and place of payment, pay to the Company, at the time or times and place so specified, the amount called on their shares.

The Board may, from time to time, at its discretion, extend the time fixed for the payment of any call, in respect of one (i) or more Members, as the Board may deem appropriate in any circumstances.

A call may be revoked or postponed at the discretion of the Board.

36. CALL WHEN MADE

The Board of Directors may, when making a call by resolution, determine the date on which such call shall be deemed to have been made, not being earlier than the date of resolution making such call, and thereupon the call shall be deemed to have been made on the date so determined and if no such date is so determined a call shall be deemed to
