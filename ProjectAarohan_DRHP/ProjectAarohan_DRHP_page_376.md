Provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets are reviewed at each reporting date.

(xvii) **Warranty**

The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failures. The timing of outflows will vary as and when warranty claim will arise, being typically between 3 to 8 years.

(xviii) **Earnings per share**

**Basic earnings per share**

The basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit/(loss) attributable to our owners for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period/year.

**Diluted earnings per share**

Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the year, unless issued at a later date. In computing diluted earnings per share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive and that either reduces earnings per share or increases loss per share are included.

(xix) **Foreign currency translations**

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by our respective entities at their respective functional currency spot rates; at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which they arise. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

(xx) **Operating Segment**

Based on the guiding principles given in Ind AS 108 on 'Operating Segments', our business activity falls within one operating segment. Our Board of Directors monitor the operating results as a whole for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the Restated Consolidated Financial Statements, thus the disclosures requirements under Ind AS 108 – "Segment Reporting" are not applicable.

(xxi) **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

(xxii) **Statement of cash flows**

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method as set out in Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 7 on Statement of Cash Flows, whereby profit/(loss) for the period/year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals, or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities are segregated

(xxiii) **Recent accounting pronouncements**

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 through notifications dated:

a. 7 May 2025, introducing changes to Ind AS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, effective from 1 April 2025. These amendments provide guidance on assessing whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency and on estimating the spot exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable. We have considered this amendment and believe that there is no material impact on the Restated Consolidated Financial Information.
