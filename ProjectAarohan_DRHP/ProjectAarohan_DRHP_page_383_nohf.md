Other income decreased from ₹ 127.83 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 110.99 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to a decrease in interest income under the effective interest method on financial assets carried at amortised cost from ₹ 113.89 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 88.74 million in Fiscal 2024. The decrease in interest income was primarily on account of utilisation of fixed deposits balances to repay short-term borrowings in Fiscal 2024, resulting in lower average balances during the year. Other decreases included rental income from investment property, which declined from ₹ 5.30 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 4.67 million in Fiscal 2024, gain on termination of lease from ₹ 3.74 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 0.30 million in Fiscal 2024, profit on sale of property, plant and equipment (net) from ₹ 1.43 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 0.30 million in Fiscal 2024. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in rental income from operating leases from ₹ 0.69 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 13.04 million in Fiscal 2024, foreign exchange gain (net) from ₹ 1.18 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 1.18 million in Fiscal 2024.

## Total Expenses

Total expenses increased by 2.06% from ₹ 10,747.62 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 10,968.95 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in cost of materials consumed, employee benefits expense and other expenses.

### Cost of materials consumed

Cost of materials consumed increased by 6.48% from ₹ 5,351.33 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 5,698.14 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in raw materials consumed on account of higher sales, including increased consumption of petrochemical inputs for foam for mattress production.

### Purchase of stock-in-trade

Purchase of stock-in-trade decreased by 26.59% from ₹ 537.97 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 394.95 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to the shift from traded SKUs to in-house manufacturing of certain furniture products.

### Changes in inventories of finished goods, semi-finished goods and stock in trade

The change in inventories of finished goods, semi-finished goods and stock in trade was ₹ 161.01 million in Fiscal 2023 compared to ₹ 37.77 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in the in-house manufacturing activities in relation to furniture products, which were previously outsourced. This shift helped reduce dependency on third parties on the time taken to complete manufacturing and delivery of products, which resulted in a decrease in inventory.

### Employee benefits expense

Employee benefits expense increased by 1.78% from ₹ 969.40 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 986.65 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in staff welfare expenses from ₹ 63.06 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 75.61 million in Fiscal 2024, which mainly comprised canteen expenses for factory employees and employee insurance. The increase in staff welfare expenses in Fiscal 2024 was also on account of expenses incurred towards employee related events, primarily an event to commemorate our foundation (which is a non-recurring event). In addition, gratuity expense increased from ₹ 16.64 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 19.07 million in Fiscal 2024 and share based payment expense increased from ₹ 13.62 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 15.38 million in Fiscal 2024.

### Finance costs

Finance costs decreased by 42.01% from ₹ 167.90 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 97.36 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to a decrease in interest on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost on borrowings from banks from ₹ 120.00 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 42.40 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily on account of repayment of long-term borrowings as per their repayment schedules and closure of certain short-term borrowings by utilisation of fixed deposits during the year; and interest on income tax from ₹ 3.00 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 0.30 million in Fiscal 2024. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost on lease liabilities from ₹ 33.11 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 41.76 million in Fiscal 2024.

### Depreciation and amortisation expense

Depreciation and amortisation expense decreased by 2.36% from ₹ 445.54 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 435.02 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation of property, plant and equipment from ₹ 260.70 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 237.46 million in Fiscal 2024 and a decrease in amortisation of intangible assets from ₹ 41.27 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 32.72 million in Fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase in depreciation of right-of-use assets from ₹ 143.07 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 164.34 million in Fiscal 2024, which was due to recognition of new right-of-use assets arising from leases entered into during Fiscal 2024.
