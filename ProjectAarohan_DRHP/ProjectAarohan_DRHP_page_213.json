For mattress deliveries, we primarily use our transport network through hired transport services, and for areas beyond our reach, we engage third-party logistics service providers. For furniture, we use our own network for most orders, with third-party providers handling the rest. We optimize our packaging to reduce logistics costsâ€”flat-packing for furniture and roll-packing for mattresses. We utilize technology and analytics platforms for manufacturing and inventory management, logistics, to improve inventory management, route planning, and operational transparency. Our order management system directs orders to the most optimal delivery paths, with last-mile route planning managed through a logistics management platform."}, {"bbox": [456, 1250, 1244, 2089], "category": "Picture"}]
