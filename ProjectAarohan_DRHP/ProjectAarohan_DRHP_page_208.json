Prototypes made of the material combinations identified at the engineering stage undergo rigorous testing for strength, stability, and durability to ensure they meet our standards. Testing is done at external laboratories, such as TÜV as well as our own in-house testing facilities. The extensive testing includes ILD (Indentation Load Deflection) for firmness and rollator (50,000 – 100,000 cycles equivalent to a five-to-ten-year usable life) test for mattress durability."}]
