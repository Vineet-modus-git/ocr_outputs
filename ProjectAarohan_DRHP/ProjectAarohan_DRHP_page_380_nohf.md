# FISCAL 2025 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2024

## Total Income

Total Income increased by 4.21% from ₹ 11,063.95 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 11,529.49 million in Fiscal 2025.

This was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from operations and other income.

## Revenue from operations

Revenue from operations increased by 3.56% from ₹ 10,952.96 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 11,342.50 million in Fiscal 2025, primarily due to an increase in sales of products from ₹ 10,865.76 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 11,244.79 million in Fiscal 2025. In Fiscal 2025, we further scaled back our e-commerce strategy as compared to Fiscal 2024 and saw revenue growth driven by cost correction and increased contributions from trade stores, COCO stores, OEM and institutional channels. The table below sets forth details of our revenues from the sale of mattress, branded foam, furniture, accessories and other operating revenues for the years indicated:

The increase in our revenue from operations was primarily due to an increase in the sales of our mattress and branded foam products, offset by a decline in revenue from our furniture and accessories products. The following drivers contributed to an increase in revenue:

* The revenue from the sale of mattress increased due to an increase in sales volumes in Fiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024.

* The increase in our revenue from the sale of branded foam was primarily due to the continued expansion of our manufacturing and distribution operations beyond South India, and higher production volumes, despite a decline in average selling prices.

* Further, we also changed our distribution strategy and strategically reduced sales through e-commerce channels and increased sales through COCO stores and general trade stores, which resulted in higher sales volumes.

## Other income

Other income increased from ₹ 110.99 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 186.99 million in Fiscal 2025, primarily due to an increase in interest income under the effective interest method on financial assets carried at amortised cost from ₹ 88.74 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 118.86 million in Fiscal 2025 on account of higher average fixed deposits balances during Fiscal 2025, an increase in miscellaneous income from ₹ 1.18 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 28.14 million in Fiscal 2025, and an increase in rental income from operating leases from ₹ 13.04 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 20.50 million in Fiscal 2025 due to increase in rentals due to sub-letting unused office spaces, and liabilities or provisions no longer required written back from nil in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 11.73 million in Fiscal 2025.

## Total Expenses

Total expenses increased by 0.63% from ₹ 10,968.95 million in Fiscal 2024 to ₹ 11,037.70 million in Fiscal 2025, primarily due to an increase in the cost of materials consumed offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense, other expenses, finance costs and depreciation and amortisation expense.
