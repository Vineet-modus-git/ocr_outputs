In an effort to rationalize and modernize the framework of labour laws in India, the Government of India has introduced four comprehensive labour codes:

(a) The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, which received presidential assent on September 28, 2020, aims to consolidate and replace various existing statutes, including the Factories Act, 1948, the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, the Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961, the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996, and the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979. This Code is designed to establish comprehensive standards for the health, safety, and working conditions of employees in different establishments and will become effective on a date to be notified by the Central Government.

(b) The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, which also received presidential assent on September 28, 2020, aims to consolidate three key pieces of legislation, namely, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the Trade Unions Act, 1926, and the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. This Code will likewise come into force on a date to be specified by the Central Government.

(c) The Code on Wages, 2019, received the President's assent on August 8, 2019. Certain provisions have been brought into effect through a notification dated December 18, 2020, while the remaining provisions will be enforced on a future date as notified by the Government of India. This Code seeks to consolidate four separate statutes: the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976.

(d) The Code on Social Security, 2020, which received presidential assent on September 28, 2020, brought Section 142 into force through a notification dated April 30, 2021. The remainder of the Code's provisions will be implemented on a date to be notified by the Government of India. This Code proposes to subsume multiple legislations, including the Employee's Compensation Act, 1923, the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948, the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Employment Exchanges (Compulsory Notification of Vacancies) Act, 1959, the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, and the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.

## Intellectual Property Laws

### Trademarks Act, 1999 ("Trade Marks Act")

The Trade Marks Act provides for the registration and better protection of trade marks for goods and services and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks. The registration of a trademark under the Trade Marks Act confers on the proprietor the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark, and the right to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark. The registration of a trademark shall be for a period of ten years, but may be renewed from time to time as prescribed under the Trade Marks Act. The Trade Marks Act also prescribes penalties for the falsification or false application of trademarks.

### Patents Act, 1970 ("Patents Act")

The Patents Act governs the framework for patent protection in India. As a signatory to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ("TRIPS"), India is obligated to recognize both product and process patents. In addition to the fundamental requirements of novelty, utility, and non-obviousness for an invention to qualify for patent protection, the Patents Act specifies certain categories of inventions and materials that are ineligible for patent protection, even if they meet these criteria. Section 39 of the Patents Act prohibits any person resident in India from filing a patent application for an invention outside India without first filing a corresponding application for the same invention within India. Pursuant to Section 53 of the Patents Act, the term of a granted patent is twenty years, calculated from the filing date of the patent application. A patent will
