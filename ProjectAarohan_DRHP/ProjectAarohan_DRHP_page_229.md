**Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 ("Air Act") and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1982 ("Air Rules")**

The Air Act was enacted with the objective of preventing, controlling, and abating air pollution in India. As a specialized piece of environmental legislation, the Air Act is intended to ensure the preservation of the earth's natural resources, including the maintenance of air quality and the control of air pollution. Pursuant to the Air Act, any individual, industry, or institution that emits smoke or gases, whether due to the use of fuel or chemical reactions, is required to apply in the prescribed form and obtain prior consent from the relevant Pollution Control Board ("PCB") before commencing any such activity. The PCB is obligated to grant or refuse consent within four months of receiving the application. Any consent granted may be subject to specific conditions, including requirements for the installation of designated pollution control equipment, with the aim of minimizing emissions and preserving air quality.

**Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 ("Water Act") and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Board, 1975 ("Water Rules")**

The Water Act was enacted to control and prevent water pollution and to maintain or restore the wholesomeness of water in India. The primary objective of this legislation is to ensure that domestic and industrial pollutants are not discharged into streams and wells without undergoing adequate treatment. Compliance with the Water Act requires obtaining the requisite consents from authorities. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 2024 (the "Amendment Act") introduced significant revisions to the Water Act. Notably, the Amendment Act decriminalises minor offences related to water pollution, providing for the imposition of penalties in lieu of imprisonment for technical or procedural lapses. The Amendment Act further empowers the central government to exempt certain categories of industrial plants from specified statutory restrictions, thereby streamlining regulatory processes. In addition, the Amendment Act enhances regulatory oversight and promotes standardisation across states by granting the central government the authority to prescribe guidelines for the appointment of chairpersons of State Pollution Control Boards and to issue directives concerning industry-related consent procedures.

Monitoring and enforcement of these obligations are facilitated through dedicated online platforms and regular inspection drives.
