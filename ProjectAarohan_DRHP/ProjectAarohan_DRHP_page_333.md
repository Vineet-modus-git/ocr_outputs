## 40 Financial instruments - fair values and risk management (continued)

### (iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

#### a) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's borrowing comprises of working capital loan and term loans which carries variable rate of interest. The Group regularly reviews interest rates to mitigate the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

#### Interest rate risk exposure

The exposure of the Group's borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>As at<br>30 June 2025</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2025</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2024</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fixed rate borrowings</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Variable rate borrowings</td><td>76.43</td><td>97.97</td><td>232.16</td><td>1,541.01</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total borrowings</strong></td><td><strong>76.43</strong></td><td><strong>97.97</strong></td><td><strong>232.16</strong></td><td><strong>1,541.01</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

Total borrowings considered above includes current maturities of long term borrowings.

A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased / decreased equity and profit or loss by amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the reporting date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date.

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="2">Profit or loss</th><th colspan="2">Equity, net of tax</th></tr><tr><th>1% increase</th><th>1% decrease</th><th>1% increase</th><th>1% decrease</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>30 June 2025</td><td>(0.76)</td><td>0.76</td><td>(0.57)</td><td>0.57</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2025</td><td>(0.98)</td><td>0.98</td><td>(0.73)</td><td>0.73</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2024</td><td>(2.32)</td><td>2.32</td><td>(1.74)</td><td>1.74</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023</td><td>(15.41)</td><td>15.41</td><td>(11.53)</td><td>11.53</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### (b) Currency risk exposure

The foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The functional currency of the Group is Indian Rupees and its revenue is generated predominantly from operations in India.

The summary quantitative data about the Group's exposure to currency risk as reported to the management is as follows.

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th rowspan="2">Currency</th><th colspan="2">30 June 2025</th><th colspan="2">31 March 2025</th><th colspan="2">31 March 2024</th><th colspan="2">31 March 2023</th></tr><tr><th>Amount in<br>foreign currency</th><th>Amount in<br>INR</th><th>Amount in<br>foreign currency</th><th>Amount in INR</th><th>Amount in<br>foreign currency</th><th>Amount in INR</th><th>Amount in<br>foreign currency</th><th>Amount in<br>INR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Receivables</td><td>USD</td><td>755,422</td><td>64.62</td><td>447,515</td><td>38.17</td><td>66,124</td><td>5.50</td><td>170,555</td><td>14.00</td></tr><tr><td>Payables</td><td>USD</td><td>(618,088)</td><td>(52.87)</td><td>(1,146,589)</td><td>(98.44)</td><td>(536,455)</td><td>(44.70)</td><td>(285,622)</td><td>(23.50)</td></tr><tr><td>Payables</td><td>GBP</td><td>(335)</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>(135)</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(135)</td><td>(0.01)</td><td>(2,057)</td><td>(0.20)</td></tr><tr><td>Payables</td><td>EURO</td><td>(125,917)</td><td>(12.65)</td><td>(111,317)</td><td>(10.27)</td><td>(124,532)</td><td>(11.20)</td><td>(20,042)</td><td>(1.80)</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td><strong>Net exposure</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td><strong>(0.94)</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>(70.55)</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>(50.41)</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>(11.50)</strong></td></tr></tfoot></table>

#### Sensitivity analysis

A reasonably possible 5% strengthening (weakening) of the foreign currency against all other currencies as at Reporting date would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases.

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="2">Profit or loss</th><th colspan="2">Equity, net of tax</th></tr><tr><th>Strengthening</th><th>Weakening</th><th>Strengthening</th><th>Weakening</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>30 June 2025</td><td>(0.05)</td><td>0.05</td><td>(0.04)</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2025</td><td>(3.53)</td><td>3.53</td><td>(2.60)</td><td>2.60</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2024</td><td>(2.52)</td><td>2.52</td><td>(1.89)</td><td>1.89</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023</td><td>(0.58)</td><td>0.58</td><td>(0.43)</td><td>0.43</td></tr></tbody></table>
