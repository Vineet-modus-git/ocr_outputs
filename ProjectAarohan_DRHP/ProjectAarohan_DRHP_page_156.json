However, there has been a gradual shift in preference toward branded foam, particularly in the mattress and furniture segments, where quality consistency, regulatory compliance, and supply reliability are becoming critical. Branded foam accounted for approximately 40% of the total market in FY2020, increasing modestly to 44% by FY2025, and is expected to reach 47% by FY2030."}, {"bbox": [144, 1872, 1558, 2036], "category": "Text", "text": "This transition is being driven in part by unorganised mattress and furniture manufacturers increasingly sourcing branded foam as an input material to reduce quality variability and enhance product perception. Large-scale organised players like Duroflex, with in-house foam manufacturing capabilities are well-positioned to benefit from this shift. In FY2025, Duroflex derived 39% of its total revenue from PU foam and had a market share of 5.2% in the branded PU foam market, enabling it to serve both internal and external demand with better cost and quality control."}, {"bbox": [144, 2060, 1558, 2129], "category": "Text", "text": "Over the medium term, the growing adoption of branded foam is expected to contribute to the formalization within the sector, supporting demand for integrated and scalable manufacturers."}]
