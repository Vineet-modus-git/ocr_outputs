9. We depend on certain key suppliers to procure our raw materials. Further, we do not have long term agreements with suppliers for our raw materials and an increase in the cost of or a shortfall in the availability of such raw materials could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our primary raw materials are for branded foam and mattress production and include chemicals (primarily petrochemicals), as well as natural wood and latex, processed wood, fabrics, glue and metal goods. The cost of our products is dependent on our ability to source these raw materials at acceptable prices and maintain a stable and sufficient supply of such raw materials. The price and availability of raw materials are subject to volatility and unavailability caused by various external conditions, including supply and demand dynamics, logistics and processing costs, our bargaining power with suppliers, inflation, governmental regulations and policies, overall economic conditions, production levels, market demand and competition for such materials, production, duties and taxes, and trade restrictions. In particular, the price of petrochemical inputs to our branded foam and related products is highly correlated to international oil prices and can therefore be subject to fluctuations. The table below sets forth details of cost of materials consumed by us in the period/years indicated:

<table><thead><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Three months period ended June 30, 2025</td><td>Fiscal 2025</td><td>Fiscal 2024</td><td>Fiscal 2023</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cost of materials consumed (₹ million)</td><td>1,623.02</td><td>6,144.15</td><td>5,698.14</td><td>5,351.33</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue from operations (₹ million)</td><td>2,925.19</td><td>11,342.50</td><td>10,952.96</td><td>10,574.87</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of materials consumed as a percentage of Revenue from operations</td><td>55.48%</td><td>54.17%</td><td>52.02%</td><td>50.60%</td></tr></tbody></table>

We typically do not enter into long term supply contracts with any of the raw material suppliers and typically place orders with them in advance of our anticipated requirements. The absence of long-term contracts at fixed prices exposes us to volatility in the prices of raw materials that we require and we may be unable to pass these costs onto our customers. The following 10 suppliers contribute to more than 50% of the total cost of raw materials purchased in Fiscal 2025.

We also face a risk that one or more of our existing suppliers may discontinue their supplies to us, and any inability on our part to procure raw materials from alternate suppliers in a timely fashion, or on terms acceptable to us, may adversely affect our operations. While we have not experienced material disruption in the supply of our raw materials in the three months period ended June 30, 2025 and the last three Fiscals which had an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows we cannot assure you that such disruption will not occur in the future and if any such disruption occurs, such disruption may result in unexpected increases in prices of our raw materials and packaging material costs.

We import certain of our raw materials, including toluene diisocyanate, polymer polyol and base polyol from various countries such as the United States of America, China, Singapore and Korea. The table below provides our cost of imported raw materials as a percentage of our total cost of raw materials purchased in the period / years indicated:

<table><thead><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Three months period ended June 30, 2025</td><td>Fiscal 2025</td><td>Fiscal 2024</td><td>Fiscal 2023</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cost of imported raw materials (₹ million)</td><td>64.93</td><td>457.18</td><td>294.61</td><td>510.69</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of imported raw materials as a percentage of total cost of materials purchased</td><td>4.03%</td><td>7.31%</td><td>5.27%</td><td>9.57%</td></tr></tbody></table>

Any restrictions imposed by the Government of India on the import of such raw materials or any embargoes on the jurisdictions where our suppliers are located, or any increases in import duties on these raw materials, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we have not faced any such restrictions on the import of required raw materials in the three months period ended June 30, 2025 and in the last three fiscal years which had an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, we cannot assure that these issues will not arise in the future. We are also subject to the risks associated with changing international trade policies, including the imposition of anti-dumping duties by the Government of India. Anti-dumping duties can increase the cost of imported raw materials, making our
