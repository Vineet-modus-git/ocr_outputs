*During the three months period ended 30 June 2025 and financial years ended 31 March 2025, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 the Group has foreclosed certain leases and accordingly has derecognised the right-of-use asset and lease liability. The derecognition has resulted in a gain of Rs. Nil (31 March 2025: Rs. 0.41 million) (31 March 2024: Rs. 0.30 million) (31 March 2023: Rs. 3.74 million) which has been accounted as other income (refer note 32). Also, there are certain leases whose lock-in-period is expired during the three months period ended 30 June 2025 and year ended 31 March 2025 and hence derecognised the right-of-use asset.
