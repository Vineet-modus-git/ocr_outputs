The Deputy Director of Industrial Safety and Health, Hosur (\"Complainant\"), filed a complaint dated May 10, 2023, (\"Complaint\") before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Krishnagiri (\"Magistrate\") against Mathew George, the Whole-time Director of our Company (\"Petitioner\"). The Complaint alleged contraventions under Section 7A(1) (2) and Section 41 of the Factories Act, 1948, (\"Factories Act\") read with Rule 61E and Rule 61F of the Tamil Nadu Factories Rules, 1950, concerning three accidents involving contract workmen that occurred on March 24, 2015, May 18, 2015, and July 21, 2016. Following the issuance of summons by the Magistrate, the Petitioner filed a criminal original petition dated March 19, 2024, before the High Court of Judicature at Madras (\"High Court\") under Section 482 of the CrPC, seeking to quash the Complaint. The principal ground for the petition is that the Complaint is statutorily time-barred under Section 106 of the Factories Act, which mandates that a complaint must be filed within three months from the date the alleged offence came to the knowledge of the inspector. The Petitioner contends that the Complainant possessed knowledge of the accidents when the statutory Form 18 intimations were duly submitted in 2015 and 2016, not from the date of a subsequent inspection on February 16, 2023. The High Court, by its order dated March 25, 2024, held that a prima facie case has been made out by the Petitioner. Consequently, the High Court granted an interim stay"}]
