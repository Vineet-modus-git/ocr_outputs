lapse if the prescribed renewal fees are not paid within the stipulated period. Additionally, the Patents Act provides for the recognition of product patents in respect of food, medicine, and drugs. It also stipulates that the importation of patented products shall not constitute patent infringement. Moreover, under specific circumstances, the burden of proof in proceedings concerning the infringement of process patents may be shifted to the alleged infringer.

## Taxation Laws

The Goods and Services Tax ("GST") is imposed on the supply of goods or services, or both, by the Central Government and the respective State Governments. GST mandates the levy of tax on the supply of goods or services, with the Central and State Governments, including Union Territories, taxing intra-state supplies, while the Central Government is responsible for levying GST on inter-state supplies of goods or services. This taxation framework is enforced through several statutes, namely, the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ("CGST"), the corresponding State Goods and Services Tax Acts, 2017 ("SGST"), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ("UTGST"), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ("IGST"), the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, and the various rules made under these Acts.

Additionally, the Income Tax Act, 1961 ("Income Tax Act") applies to every company, whether domestic or foreign, whose income is taxable under its provisions or the relevant rules, depending on its 'residential status' and type of income involved. The Income Tax Act stipulates that residents are taxed on global income, whereas non-residents are taxed on income received, accruing, or arising in India, or deemed to have been received, accrued, or arisen in India. Every company subject to taxation under the Income Tax Act is required to comply with its provisions, including those relating to tax deduction at source, advance tax, and minimum alternative tax. In 2019, the Government enacted the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019, which amended the Income Tax Act to offer concessional tax rates to certain domestic companies and newly incorporated manufacturing companies. The Ministry of Finance, Government of India has introduced the Income Tax Bill, 2025 ("Income Tax Bill") in February 2025 with the aim to replace the Income Tax Act. The Income Tax Bill seeks to simplify Income Tax Act, reduce litigation, and enhance clarity for taxpayers. The Income Tax Bill is currently under review and if approved by the Indian Parliament, is proposed to come into effect from April 1, 2026.

Further, various state-wise legislations in relation to professional tax are applicable to entities who employ designated categories of salaried persons, which inter alia, require the employers to obtain registration certificates under relevant state legislations, pay taxes as deducted from the professional fees of employees and file returns.

## Foreign Investment and Trade Regulations

### Foreign Investment Regulations

Foreign investment in India is regulated by the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, as amended, ("FEMA") together with the FEMA (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 ("FEMA NDI Rules") and other rules, regulations, and notifications issued thereunder by the Reserve Bank of India, as well as the Consolidated FDI Policy issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade ("DPIIT"), effective from October 15, 2020, and any subsequent modifications or replacements thereof (the "Consolidated FDI Policy"). Under the FEMA NDI Rules and the Consolidated FDI Policy, up to 100% foreign investment is currently permitted in companies engaged in manufacturing activities in India, including contract manufacturing.

Additionally, in terms of the FEMA NDI Rules, the total holding by each FPI, or an investor group shall be below 10% of the total paid-up equity share capital of our Company and the total holdings of all FPIs put together with effect from April 1, 2020, can be up to the sectoral cap applicable to the sector in which our Company operates (i.e., up to 100%). Further, the RBI has enacted the Foreign Exchange Management (Mode of Payment and Reporting of Non-Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2019 which regulate the mode of payment and reporting requirements for investments in India by a person resident outside India.

### Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 and the rules framed thereunder ("FTA")

The FTA serves as the principal legislation governing foreign trade in India. The FTA, when read together with the Foreign Trade (Regulation) Rules, 1993, provides for the development and regulation of foreign trade by facilitating imports into, and enhancing exports from, India, as well as addressing matters incidental thereto. The FTA empowers the government to formulate and publish the foreign trade policy and to amend it as necessary. It also grants the government broad authority to prohibit, restrict, or regulate exports and imports, whether in general or in specific instances of foreign trade.

Pursuant to the FTA and the Foreign Trade Policy, 2023, no person is permitted to undertake any import or export activity without obtaining an importer-exporter code ("IEC") issued by the Director General of Foreign Trade. Consequently, every entity in India engaged in import or export activities must obtain a valid IEC, unless specifically exempted. The IEC remains valid until it is superseded or cancelled by the issuing authority and is applicable to all branches, divisions, units, and factories of the holder. Failure to obtain an IEC may result in penalties under the FTA.
