- A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
  - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
  - the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on a specified date to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amounts outstanding.

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flow and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on a specified date to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amounts outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, we may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI (designated as FVOCI-equity investment). This election is made on an investment-to-investment basis.

All financial assets not classified as amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, we may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

## Financial Assets: Business model assessment

Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

## Financial assets: Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

For the purpose of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during the particular period of time and for the other basic lending risks and costs.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, we consider the contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, we consider:

- contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;

- terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features;

- prepayment and extension features; and

- terms that limit our claim to cash flows from specified assets.

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

### c. Subsequent measurement

**Financial assets at FVTPL** - Subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

**Financial assets at amortized cost** - Subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
