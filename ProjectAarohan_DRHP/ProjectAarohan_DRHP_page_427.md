prescribed manner. A person, being a nominee, entitled to the Equity Shares by reason of the death of the original holder(s), shall be entitled to the same advantages to which he or she would be entitled if he or she were the registered holder of the Equity Share(s). Where the nominee is a minor, the holder(s) may make a nomination to appoint, in the prescribed manner, any person to become entitled to Equity Share(s) in the event of his or her death during the minority. A nomination shall stand rescinded upon a sale/transfer/alienation of Equity Share(s) by the person nominating. A nomination may be cancelled or modified by nominating any other person in place of the present nominee, by the holder of the Equity Shares who made the nomination, by giving a notice of such cancellation or variation to our Company. A buyer will be entitled to make a fresh nomination in the manner prescribed. Fresh nomination can be made only on the prescribed form available on request at our Registered Office or to the registrar and transfer agents of our Company.

Any person who becomes a nominee by virtue of the provisions of Section 72 of the Companies Act, 2013 shall upon the production of such evidence as may be required by the Board, elect either:

a) to register himself or herself as the holder of the Equity Shares; or

b) to make such transfer of the Equity Shares, as the deceased holder could have made.

Further, the Board may at any time give notice requiring any nominee to choose either to be registered himself or herself or to transfer the Equity Shares, and if the notice is not complied with within a period of 90 days, our Board may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the Equity Shares, until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

Since the Allotment of Equity Shares in the Offer will be made only in dematerialised mode, there is no need to make a separate nomination with our Company. Nominations registered with respective Depository Participant of the Bidder would prevail. If the Bidder wants to change the nomination, they are requested to inform their respective Depository Participant.
