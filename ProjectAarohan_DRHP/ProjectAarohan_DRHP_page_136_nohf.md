## H. Description on the historic use of the KPIs by our Company to analyse, track or monitor the operational and/or financial performance of our Company

In evaluating our business, we consider and use certain KPIs, as presented above, as a supplemental measure to review and assess our financial and operating performance. The presentation of these KPIs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Restated Consolidated Financial Information. We use these KPIs to evaluate our financial and operating performance. Some of these KPIs are not defined under Ind AS and are not presented in accordance with Ind AS. These KPIs have limitations as analytical tools. Further, these KPIs may differ from the similar information used by other companies and hence their comparability may be limited. Therefore, these metrics should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to Ind AS measures of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance,
