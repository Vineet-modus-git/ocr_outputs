* During the financial year ended 31 March 2023, the Group had developed an application to monitor sleep behaviour of its users and hence capitalised the intangible asset under development. However, based on the market research, the Group is no longer pursuing the said project for the time being and hence impaired the balance outstanding at the year end. The same has been recognised as impairment losses.

Research and development costs that are not eligible for capitalisation have been expensed off amounting to Rs. Nil for the three months period ended 30 June 2025 and for the years ended (31 March 2025: Nil) (31 March 2024: Nil) (31 March 2023: Rs. 1.34 million) and they are recognised in other expenses.
