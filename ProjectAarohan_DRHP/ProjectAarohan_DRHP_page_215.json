Our COCO Stores are exclusive stores for our products operated by the Company, ranging from 330 square feet to 4,500 square feet, with an average area of approximately 1,700 square feet, operating without holding bulky inventory: thereby improving our capital efficiency. Our strategy for adding new COCO Stores is data-driven, focusing on identifying locations with higher business potential. We assess market demand, including from our e-commerce sales, population density, and demographic trends to understand where our products have the best potential. We also review the sales performance of our existing COCO Stores to identify successful patterns and replicate them in new areas. This strategic approach has been instrumental in our retail store expansion."}, {"bbox": [145, 635, 663, 668], "category": "Text", "text": "Images of our COCO stores are set out below:"}, {"bbox": [492, 689, 1203, 1373], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [145, 1399, 503, 1431], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## General Trade and trade stores"}, {"bbox": [145, 1459, 1557, 1589], "category": "Text", "text": "Our general trade channel includes a network of retail and wholesale furniture and homewares stores, including those that are operated by our franchisees.
