Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign currency transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

**Business combinations (common control business combinations)**

Business combinations involving entities or businesses in which all the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and where that control is not transitory are accounted for as per the pooling of interest method. The pooling of interest method is considered to involve the following:

The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected in their carrying amounts.

No adjustments are made to reflect fair values or recognize any new assets or liabilities. The only adjustments that are made are to harmonize accounting policies.

The financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods should be restated as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. However, if business combination had occurred after that date, the prior period information shall be restated only from that date.

The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the financial statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing in the financial statements of the transferee. Alternatively, it is transferred to General Reserve, if any.

The identity of the reserves is preserved and appears in the financial information of the transferee in the same form in which they appeared in the financial information of the transferor.

The difference, if any, between the consideration and the amount of share capital of the acquired entity is transferred to capital reserve.

**(iii) Revenue recognition**

We recognize revenue when the control of products being sold is transferred to the customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations. The performance obligations in the contracts are fulfilled based on various customer terms including at the delivery of products, dispatch or upon customer acceptance based on various distribution channels. We have generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, because it typically controls the products or services before transferring them to the customer.

**a. Revenue from sale of products**

Revenue from the sale of products is recognised at a point in time when control of the product being sold is transferred to the customer.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, net of customer incentives, discounts, variable considerations, payments made to customers, other similar charges, as specified in the contract with the customer. Additionally, revenue excludes taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

For contracts that permit the customer to return an item, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. Therefore, the amount of revenue recognised is adjusted for expected returns, which are estimated based on the historical data. In these circumstances, a refund liability and a right to recover returned goods asset are recognised.

**b. Assets and liabilities arising from right to return**

We have contracts with customers which entitles them to the unconditional right to return.

*Right to return assets*

A right of return gives an entity a contractual right to recover the products from a customer (right to return asset), if the customer exercises its option to return the products and obtain a refund. The asset is measured at the carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the products, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned products.

*Refund Liabilities*

A refund liability is the obligation to refund part, or all of the consideration received (or receivable) from the customer. We therefore recognize refund liabilities in respect of the customer's right to return. The liability is measured at the amount we
