Currencies of a few Asian countries have in the past suffered depreciation against the U.S. Dollar owing to various factors. Although economic conditions vary across markets, loss of investor confidence in one emerging economy may cause increased volatility across other economies, including India. Any worldwide financial instability may cause increased volatility in the Indian financial markets and, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the Indian economy and financial sector and us. Financial instability in other parts of the world could have a global influence and thereby negatively affect the Indian economy. Concerns related to a trade war between large economies may lead to increased risk aversion and volatility in global capital markets and consequently have an impact on the Indian economy. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our Equity Shares."}, {"bbox": [146, 759, 1523, 792], "category": "Section-header", "text": "**78.
