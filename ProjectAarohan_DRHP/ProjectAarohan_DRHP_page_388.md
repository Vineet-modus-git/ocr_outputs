acts as a security in case of default. Our normal credit period is 30-60 days. On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, we use the expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss. Based on the industry practices and the business environment in which the entity operates, we consider the trade receivables to be in default (credit impaired) if the payments are more than 180 days past due.

### (ii) Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with our financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to our reputation. We have obtained term loans and working capital limits from various banks. We monitor rolling the forecast of our liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of our expected cash flows. Our objective is to maintain a balance between cash outflow and inflow. Usually, the excess of funds is invested in fixed deposits and other financial instruments. This is generally carried out in accordance with practice and limits set by us. The limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which we operate. We have a strong focus on liquidity and maintain a robust cash position to ensure adequate cover for responding to potential short-term market dislocation. Cash generated through operating activities remains the primary source for liquidity along with undrawn borrowing facilities and levels of cash and cash equivalents.

## Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect our income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long-term debt. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

### (i) Interest rate risk

The interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Our borrowing comprises of working capital loans and term loans which carry variable rate of interest. We regularly review interest rates to mitigate the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

### (ii) Currency risk

The foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The functional currency of our Company is Indian Rupees, and our revenue is generated predominantly from operations in India. We regularly review foreign exchange rates to mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations. For further details, see note 40 of the Restated Consolidated Financial Statements.

### (iii) Equity price risk

We do not have any exposures to equity price risk.
