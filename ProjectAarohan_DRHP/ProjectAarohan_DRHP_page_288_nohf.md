## 2 Material accounting policies (continued)

### iii) Revenue Recognition

The Group recognizes revenue when the control of products being sold is transferred to the customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations. The performance obligations in the contracts are fulfilled based on various customer terms including at the time of delivery of products, dispatch or upon customer acceptance based on various distribution channels. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, because it typically controls the products or services before transferring them to the customer.

#### a. Revenue from sale of products

Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the point in time when control of the products being sold is transferred to the customer.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, net of customer incentives, discounts, variable considerations, payments made to customers, other similar charges, as specified in the contract with the customer. Additionally, revenue excludes taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

For contracts that permit the customer to return an item, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. Therefore, the amount of revenue recognised is adjusted for expected returns, which are estimated based on the historical data. In these circumstances, a refund liability and a right to recover returned goods asset are recognised.

#### b. Assets and liabilities arising from right to return

The Group has contracts with customers which entitles them the unconditional right to return.

##### *Right to return assets*

A right of return gives an entity a contractual right to recover the products from a customer (right to return asset), if the customer exercises its option to return the products and obtain a refund. The asset is measured at the carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the products, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned products.

##### *Refund liabilities*

A refund liability is the obligation to refund part or all of the consideration received (or receivable) from the customer. The Group has therefore recognized refund liabilities in respect of customer's right to return. The liability is measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects it will have to return to the customer. The Group updates its estimate of refund liabilities (and the corresponding change in the transaction price) at the end of each reporting period.

The Group has presented its right to return assets and refund liabilities under "Inventory" and "other current financial liabilities", respectively.

#### c. Contract balances

##### *Trade receivables*

A trade receivable is recognized if an amount of consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets for initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial assets.

##### *Contract assets*

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer, where that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment.

##### *Contract liabilities*

A contract liability is recognized if a payment is received, or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from the customer before the Group transfers the related goods or services. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Group performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods or services to the customer).

#### d. Other Operating Income

Revenue from sale of scrap in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the transaction price.

Income from duty drawback are recognized in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss account when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the entitlement is established in respect of exports made and disclosed as other operating revenues.

The Group initially recognises the government grants related to assets as deferred income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received, and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants related to the acquisition of assets are recognised in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.

### iv) Other income

##### *Interest income*

For all financial instruments measured at amortized cost, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Interest income is included in other income in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.
