**vi) Assumptions**

The principal assumptions used in determining gratuity obligations are shown below:

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>For the three months<br>period ended<br>30 June 2025</th><th>For the year ended<br>31 March 2025</th><th>For the year ended<br>31 March 2024</th><th>For the year ended<br>31 March 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discount rate</td><td>6.10% - 6.20%</td><td>6.55% - 6.60%</td><td>7.15% - 7.20%</td><td>7.30%</td></tr><tr><td>Rate of escalation in salary</td><td>10% - 12%</td><td>10% - 12%</td><td>10.00% - 13.00%</td><td>7.00% - 14%</td></tr><tr><td>Withdrawal Rate</td><td>19% - 23%</td><td>19% - 23%</td><td>22.00%</td><td>21% - 22%</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement age</td><td>58 years</td><td>58 years</td><td>58 years</td><td>58 years</td></tr><tr><td>Mortality rate during employment</td><td colspan="4">IALM(2012-14) Ult table</td></tr></tbody></table>

(i) The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date for the estimated term of the obligations.

(ii) The government security yields for the relevant tenure of the obligations have been derived from the rates published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL).

(iii) The estimates of future salary increases considered takes into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors.

**vii) Sensitivity analysis**

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, future salary growth, attrition rate and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the year/period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The results of sensitivity analysis is given below:

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="2">30 June 2025</th><th colspan="2">31 March 2025</th></tr><tr><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Impact of change in discount rate by 100 basis points</td><td>(3.69)</td><td>4.00</td><td>(3.37)</td><td>3.64</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of change in salary rate by 100 basis points</td><td>3.16</td><td>(3.04)</td><td>2.87</td><td>(2.77)</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of change in attrition rate by 100 basis points</td><td>(0.85)</td><td>0.90</td><td>(0.77)</td><td>0.80</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Particulars</th><th colspan="2">31 March 2024</th><th colspan="2">31 March 2023</th></tr><tr><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Impact of change in discount rate by 100 basis points</td><td>(3.69)</td><td>4.02</td><td>(3.52)</td><td>3.85</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of change in salary rate by 100 basis points</td><td>3.19</td><td>(3.07)</td><td>3.11</td><td>(2.98)</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of change in attrition rate by 100 basis points</td><td>(0.88)</td><td>0.93</td><td>(0.97)</td><td>1.04</td></tr></tbody></table>

**viii) The expected maturity analysis of undiscounted gratuity benefit is as follows :**

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>As at<br>30 June 2025</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2025</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2024</th><th>As at<br>31 March 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Less than a year</td><td>18.02</td><td>15.18</td><td>15.69</td><td>12.33</td></tr><tr><td>Between 1-2 years</td><td>16.44</td><td>13.78</td><td>14.23</td><td>11.08</td></tr><tr><td>Between 2-5 years</td><td>41.80</td><td>35.13</td><td>39.61</td><td>32.27</td></tr><tr><td>Over 5 years</td><td>52.29</td><td>44.62</td><td>57.66</td><td>57.21</td></tr></tbody></table>

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations is 4.36 years (31 March 2025 : 4.34 years) (31 March 2024 : 4.58 years) (31 March 2023 : 5 years).
