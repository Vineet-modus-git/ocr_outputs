As permitted by the Guidance Note on Division II - Ind AS Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013, we have elected to present earnings before finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense and tax as a separate line item on the face of the Restated Consolidated Statement of profit and loss. We measure earnings before finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense and tax on the basis of profit/(loss) from continuing operations. In its measurement, we do not include finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense and income tax expenses.

### Business combinations (other than common control business combinations)

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to us. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, we assess whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value as at the date the control is acquired (acquisition date), as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve through OCI.

Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in the OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve if there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase, then gain on a bargain purchase is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve.

Transaction costs/ acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred and services are received, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships with the acquiree. Such amounts are generally recognised in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss.

If a business combination is achieved in stages, then the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit and loss or OCI, as appropriate.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured, and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss.

### Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by us. We control an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. The financial information of subsidiaries is included in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.

The Restated Consolidated Financial Information is prepared using uniform material accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. Items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries are combined like to like basis. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognized in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information at the acquisition date.

### Non-controlling interests (NCI)

NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets on the date of acquisition. Profit or loss and each component of the other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the Parent and to the NCI. Changes in our interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

### Loss of control

When we lose control over a subsidiary, we derecognise the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
