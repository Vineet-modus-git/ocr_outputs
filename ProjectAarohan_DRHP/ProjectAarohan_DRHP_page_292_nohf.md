#### e. Share-based payments

Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). The Group measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options plans using the fair valuation method in accordance with Ind AS 102 "Share-Based Payment".

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using the Black Scholes model and the cost is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in share based payment reserve in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in a graded vesting manner. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.

In case of cancellation or settlement of grant of equity instruments during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied), the Group shall account for the cancellation or settlement as an acceleration of vesting and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period. Any payment made to the employee on the cancellation or settlement of the grant shall be accounted for as the repurchase of an equity interest, i.e., as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

#### x) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

##### A) Financial Instruments - Financial Assets

###### a. Recognition and initial measurement

Trade receivables are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets are initially recognized when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not at Fair value through profit and loss account ("FVTPL"), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

###### b. Classification and subsequent measurement

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at

- Amortised cost;

- Fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI") â€“ equity investment; or

- FVOCI- debt investment; or

- FVTPL

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on a specified date to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amounts outstanding.

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flow and selling financial assets; and

- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on a specified date to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amounts outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI (designated as FVOCI- equity investment). This election is made on an investment-to-investment basis.

All financial assets not classified as amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

**Financial Assets: Business model assessment**

Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

**Financial assets: Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.**

For the purpose of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during the particular period of time and for the other basic lending risks and costs.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;

- terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features;

- prepayment and extension features; and

- terms that limit the Group claim to cash flows from specified assets.

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.
