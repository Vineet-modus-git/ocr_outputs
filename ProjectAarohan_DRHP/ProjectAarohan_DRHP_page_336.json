The Group had not succeeded in commercialising the products developed by the research activities and the Board of directors of the Group on the basis of the legal opinion and based on the technical report are of the opinion that the project did not result in the commercialisation of any product and as such the loan from Indian Jute Industries Research Association (IJIRA) and Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) is not repayable. TIFAC had referred the matter to Arbitration. The Arbitration order was set aside by the Hon'ble District Court Alappuzha and referred back to the Arbitrator.
