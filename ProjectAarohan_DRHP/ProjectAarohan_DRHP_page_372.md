**Debt instruments at FVOCI** - Subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified to the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

**Equity instruments at FVOCI** - Subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and are not reclassified to the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

### d. Derecognition

We derecognise a financial asset when:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expiration; or

- it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either:

- substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or

- we neither transfer nor retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and do not retain control of the financial asset.

We enter into transactions whereby we transfer assets recognised on our Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities but retain either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

## Financial Instruments - Financial Liabilities

### a. Recognition and initial measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or amortized cost. All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its issue.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Our financial liabilities include trade and other payables, lease liabilities, refund liabilities and borrowings.

### b. Subsequent measurement

**Financial liabilities at amortized cost:** After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains or losses are recognized in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

**Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss:** These include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as being held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

### c. Derecognition

We derecognise a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. We also derecognise financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
