Key players in the mattress industry in India are rapidly enlarging their physical presence through a combination of company-owned and franchise formats to tap into growing demand across urban and semi-urban markets. Duroflex and other competitors are scaling their presence, particularly through Trade Stores, with Duroflex having second highest number of stores after Sheela Foam and has 5,576 trade stores of which around 60% are concentrated in South India. Also, Duroflex is one of the few brands with a strong omnichannel presence and has significantly scaled presence across both online and offline channels. Sheela Foam and Kurlon are among the leading national brands, collectively operating over 22,000 trade stores across the country. While the preferred formats for expansion for key players include MBOs, EBOs and through exclusive dealership of brands with retailers, players are increasingly adopting omnichannel strategies, blending their offline presence with digital platforms to offer customers a seamless shopping experience and reach untapped markets efficiently. As of FY2025, Duroflex products were available in over 5,408 trade stores, making it the second broadest distribution network in the Indian sleep and comfort solutions industry after Sheela Foam Limited.
