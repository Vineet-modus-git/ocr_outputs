will develop, or if developed, the liquidity of such market for the Equity Shares. Our Equity Shares are expected to trade on NSE and BSE after the Offer, but there can be no assurance that active trading in our Equity Shares will develop after the Offer, or if such trading develops that it will continue. Investors may not be able to sell our Equity Shares at the quoted price if there is no active trading in our Equity Shares. There has been significant volatility in the Indian stock markets in the recent past, and the trading price of our Equity Shares after the Offer could fluctuate significantly as a result of market volatility or due to various internal or external risks, including but not limited to those described in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. The market price of our Equity Shares may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others:

(i) the failure of security analysts to cover the Equity Shares after the Offer, or changes in the estimates of our performance by analysts;

(ii) the activities of competitors and suppliers;

(iii) future sales of the Equity Shares by us or our Shareholders;

(iv) investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;

(v) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations of principles;

(vi) our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;

(vii) developments affecting fiscal, industrial or environmental regulations; and

(viii) the public's reaction to our press releases and adverse media reports.

A decrease in the market price of our Equity Shares could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.

**68. Investors may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of income arising on the sale of the Equity Shares.**

Under current Indian tax laws, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares in an Indian company are generally taxable in India. Any capital gain exceeding INR 125,000, realized on the sale of listed equity shares on a recognized stock exchange, held for more than 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer, will be subject to long term capital gains in India, at the rate of 12.5% (plus applicable surcharge and cess). This beneficial rate is, among others, subject to payment of Securities Transaction Tax ("STT"). Further, any gain realized on the sale of equity shares in an Indian company held for more than 12 months, which are sold using any platform other than a recognized stock exchange and on which no STT has been paid, will be subject to long term capital gains tax in India, at the rate of 12.5% (plus applicable surcharge and cess).

Further, any capital gains realized on the sale of listed equity shares held for a period of 12 months or less immediately preceding the date of transfer will be subject to short term capital gains tax in India. Such gains will be subject to tax at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess), subject to STT being paid at the time of sale of such shares. Otherwise, such gains will be taxed at the applicable rates.

Capital gains arising from the sale of the Equity Shares will be exempt from taxation in India in cases where the exemption from taxation in India is provided under a treaty between India and the country of which the seller is resident (as per tax laws). Generally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India's ability to impose tax on capital gains. As a result, residents of other countries may be liable for tax in India as well as in their jurisdiction on a gain upon the sale of the Equity Shares.

Similarly, any business income realized from the transfer of Equity Shares held as business or trading assets is taxable at the applicable tax rates. In the case of a non-resident seller, the applicable tax rates may be subject to any treaty relief, if applicable.

Additionally, the Indian tax laws require deduction of tax at source in respect of dividends declared, distributed or paid by a domestic company after March 31, 2020, and such dividends would be taxable at applicable rates in the hands of the shareholders, both resident as well as non-resident (for tax purposes). We may or may not grant the benefit of a tax treaty (where applicable) to a non-resident shareholder for the purposes of deducting tax at source pursuant to any corporate action including dividends.

**69. Any future issuance of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity linked instruments by us may dilute your shareholding and sale of Equity Shares by shareholders with significant shareholding may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.**

We may be required to finance our growth through future equity offerings. Any future equity issuances by us, including a primary offering of Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to Equity Shares, may lead to the dilution of investors' shareholdings in our Company. Any future equity issuances by us or sales of our Equity Shares by our Shareholders may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares, which may lead to other adverse consequences including difficulty
