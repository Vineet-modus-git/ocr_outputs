*(All amounts are in Rs. million, except share data and per share data, unless otherwise stated)*

## 2 Material accounting policies (continued)

### (i) Basis of preparation (continued)

#### b. Basis of measurement

These Restated Consolidated Financial Information are prepared in accordance with Ind AS under the historical cost (i.e. on accrual basis), except for the following which have been measured at fair value:

- Financial instruments classified as fair value through profit and loss

- defined benefit plans and

- share-based payments

#### c. Functional and presentation currency

These Restated Consolidated Financial Information are presented in Indian Rupees (Rs.), which is also the Group's functional currency. All amount disclosed in these Restated Consolidated Financial Information and notes have been rounded off to nearest millions as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated. Transactions and balances with values below the rounding off norm adopted by the Group have been reflected as "0" in the relevant notes to these Restated Consolidated Financial Information.

#### d. Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of Restated Consolidated Financial Information in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information.

##### (i) Judgements

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information is included in the following notes:

- Note 6 - Lease term: whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise extension options.

##### (ii) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at the reporting date that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is included in the following notes:

- Note 3 and 7 - useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;

- Note 41 - measurement of share based payments: Fair value of option at the grant date;

- Note 30 - provision for warranties;

- Note 39 - recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which deductible temporary differences and tax loss carried forward can be utilized;

- Note 40 - measurement of ECL allowance for trade and finance receivables, loans and contract assets: key assumptions in determining the weighted-average loss rate;

- Note 40 - fair value measurement of financial instruments;

- Note 42 - recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources;

- Note 45 - measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions;

- Note 28 - refund liabilities;

- Note 5 - investment property; and

- Note 7 - impairment test of intangible assets and goodwill: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts, including the recoverability of development costs.

#### e. Current and non-current classification

Based on the time involved between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents, the Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle for determining current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

#### f. Measurement of fair values

Certain accounting policies and disclosures of the Group require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non financial assets and liabilities.

The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The Group regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information is used to measure the fair values, then the Group assess the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of the Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.

Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into a different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirely in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

#### g. Earnings before finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense and tax

As permitted by the Guidance Note on Division II - Ind AS Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013, the Group has elected to present earnings before finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense and tax as a separate line item on the face of the Restated Consolidated Statement of profit and loss. The Group measures earnings before finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense and tax on the basis of profit/(loss) from continuing operations. In its measurement, the Group does not include finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense and income tax expenses.
