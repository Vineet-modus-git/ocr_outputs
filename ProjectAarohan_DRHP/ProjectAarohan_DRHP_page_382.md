## FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023

### Total Income

Total Income increased by 3.38% from ₹ 10,702.70 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 11,063.95 million in Fiscal 2024. This was primarily attributable to an increase in Revenue from operations and Other income.

### Revenue from operations

Revenue from operations increased by 3.58% from ₹ 10,574.87 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 10,952.96 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in the sale of products from ₹ 10,421.70 million in Fiscal 2023 to ₹ 10,865.76 million in Fiscal 2024. The table below sets forth details of our revenues from the sale of mattress, branded foam, furniture, accessories and other operating revenues for the years indicated:

The increase in our revenue from operations was primarily due to an increase in the sale of branded foam and furniture products, offset by a decline in revenue from our mattress and accessories products. The following drivers contributed to an increase in revenue from branded foam sales:

* We focused on expanding our operations in the branded foam segment beyond South India and further strengthened retail partnerships in that region.

* Higher sales volumes in the branded foam products.

* There was also an increase in the volume of sales from the OEM and institutional channels, which resulted in an overall increase in revenue.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of branded foam.

Further, in relation to mattress products, in Fiscal 2024, we refocused our distribution strategy away from external e-commerce channels (due to pricing considerations), which led to a reduction in revenue from the sales of mattress.
