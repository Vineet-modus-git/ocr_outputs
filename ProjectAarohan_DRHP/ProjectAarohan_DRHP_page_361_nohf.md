*Basis of measurement*

The Restated Consolidated Financial Information are prepared in accordance with Ind AS under the historical cost (i.e. on accrual basis), except for the following which have been measured at fair value:

- Financial instruments classified as fair value through profit and loss

- defined benefit plans and

- share-based payments

*Functional and presentation currency*

The Restated Consolidated Financial Information are presented in Indian Rupees (Rs.), which is also our functional currency. All amount disclosed in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information and notes have been rounded off to nearest millions as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated. Transactions and balances with values below the rounding off norm adopted by us have been reflected as “0” in the relevant notes to these Restated Consolidated Financial Information.

*Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions*

The preparation of the Restated Consolidated Financial Information in conformity with Ind AS requires our management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. The following discussion provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information.

### (a) Judgements

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information is included in the following notes:

- Note 6 - Lease term: whether we are reasonably certain to exercise extension options.
