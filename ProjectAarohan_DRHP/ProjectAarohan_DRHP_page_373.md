Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Restated Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities when, and only when, we currently have a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and we intend either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## Recognition of Interest income or expense

Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest rate.

The 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or

- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

### (xi) Leases

#### As a Lessee

At inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

To assess where we have the right to control the use of identified assets, we assess whether the:

- the contract involves the use of identified assets,

- whether we have the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of assets throughout the period of use and

- whether we have the right to direct the use of assets.

#### a. Right-of-use

We recognize right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of Right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial cost incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date. The Right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term basis over a lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

#### b. Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, we recognize lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments and less any lease incentives receivable, including amounts expected to be payable by us under the residual value guarantee. In calculating the present value of lease payments, we use its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. We determine its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and making certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in our estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

#### c. Short-term leases

We have elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less from the commencement date and leases of low-value assets. We recognise the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term.

#### As a Lessor

When we act as a lessor, we determine at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, we make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As
