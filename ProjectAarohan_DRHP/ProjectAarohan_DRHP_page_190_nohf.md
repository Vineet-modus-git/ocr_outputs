The scale at which we manufacture our products, combined with our supply chain management, enables us to derive the benefits of economies of scale across various aspects of our business model. Further, we maintain appropriate inventory levels across our manufacturing facilities by implementing technology and utilising available market information. We also endeavor to maintain high quality standards and good manufacturing practices. Further, we have 19 warehouses (1 mother warehouse and 18 regional Depots) at various locations across India, which facilitates product availability across our distribution network. Our diversified omni-channel distribution network covers multiple online and offline touchpoints. Our distribution channels include COCO Stores, e-commerce, general trade, institutional and OEM sales and branded foam sales.

We follow a multi-pronged approach towards marketing, spanning celebrity collaborations, community engagement, social media influencers and marketing campaigns. Our marketing strategy follows a targeted approach for different products and customer categories. Further, several of our marketing initiatives and collaborations are content based, aimed at creating awareness on the importance of sleep, quality of mattresses and creating aspiration amongst customers for premium mattresses.

We are led by third-generation, entrepreneurial promoters, Jacob Joseph George, Mathew Chandy, Mathew George and Mathew Antony Joseph. Our Promoters' leadership and experience has enabled us to grow our product portfolio and develop brands, build a pan-India distribution network, maintain relationships with our distributors and retailers, and expand our manufacturing capabilities, in turn driving our growth in revenue from operations and profit margins. Our Promoters are supported by a qualified management team and experienced board of directors. We are also supported by marquee investors, Lighthouse India Fund Lighthouse Trust, and Norwest. Their strategic guidance has helped us achieve our business goals.
