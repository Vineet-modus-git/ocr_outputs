## Data Protection Regulations

**The Information Technology Act, 2000 ("IT Act") and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 ("IT Security Rules")**

The IT Act is intended to accord legal recognition to transactions conducted through various modes of electronic data interchange and electronic communications, thereby facilitating the electronic filing of documents, including those containing sensitive personal data such as medical records and history. The IT Act establishes a robust framework for the authentication of electronic documents through the use of digital signatures. By recognizing contracts formed electronically, the IT Act streamlines electronic commerce, provides protection to intermediaries from third-party liability for information hosted on their platforms, and imposes liability for failures to adequately safeguard sensitive personal data.

The IT Security Rules set out requirements for the disclosure, collection, and transfer of sensitive personal data by a body corporate, or any person acting on its behalf. The IT Security Rules stipulate that every such body corporate, or person handling personal information on its behalf, must adopt and make publicly available a privacy policy outlining the handling and processing of personal information, including sensitive personal data, and must publish such policy on its website. Additionally, the IT Security Rules require that all personal data be processed exclusively for the purpose for which it was collected, and that any disclosure of personal information to third parties is subject to the prior consent of the information provider, unless such disclosure is contractually agreed upon by the parties or is otherwise required by law.

**The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 ("DPDP Act") and the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025 ("Draft DPDP Rules") (together, "DPDP Framework")**

The Government enacted the DPDP Act in 2023, although its provisions are yet to be brought into force. Additionally, on January 3, 2025, the Government released the Draft DPDP Rules to operationalise certain aspects of the DPDP Act. The DPDP Framework classifies entities that determine the purposes and means of processing personal data as "data fiduciaries" and imposes various obligations upon them. These include requirements to obtain consent and provide notice in the prescribed manner, ensure the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of personal data, notify relevant authorities in the event of personal data breaches, and implement appropriate technical safeguards and reasonable security measures.

Beyond these general obligations, the DPDP Framework prescribes enhanced compliance requirements for "significant data fiduciaries" ("SDFs"), a classification to be notified by the central government based on criteria such as the volume and sensitivity of personal data processed, the risk posed to the rights of data principals, the potential impact on the sovereignty and integrity of India, the risk to electoral democracy, security of the State, and public order. Obligations applicable to SDFs include appointing a data protection officer, appointing an independent data auditor, conducting data protection impact assessments, and undergoing periodic audits. Entities that process personal data on behalf of others are categorised as "data processors" under the DPDP framework. While the DPDP Framework does not impose direct statutory obligations on data processors, data fiduciaries are permitted to contractually impose relevant obligations on their data processors.

Once the DPDP Framework comes into effect, we will be required to be in compliance with these requirements to the extent applicable.

## Key Environmental Legislations

**Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, as amended by the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Amendment Rules, 2022 ("Hazardous Waste Rules")**

The Hazardous Waste Rules govern the management, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste, mandating that every occupier and operator of a facility generating such waste must ensure its disposal in a manner that does not harm the environment. The Hazardous Waste Rules provide a comprehensive list of hazardous wastes and the processes that result in their generation. It is incumbent upon relevant entities to obtain the necessary authorizations from the concerned State Pollution Control Board for various activities involving hazardous waste, including its generation, processing, treatment, packaging, storage, transportation, use, collection, destruction, or transfer.

**Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991 ("Public Liability Insurance Act") and the rules made thereunder**

The Public Liability Insurance Act and the Public Liability Insurance Rules, 1991 ("Public Liability Insurance Rules"), as amended in 2024, collectively establish a framework of strict liability for owners or controllers of hazardous substances in the event of any damage arising from accidents involving such substances. The amendments made to the Public Liability Insurance Rules in 2024 significantly enhanced the claims and compensation process for environmental harm resulting from industrial accidents. Pursuant to these legislative provisions, the government has notified a comprehensive list of hazardous substances subject to these regulations. The Public Liability Insurance Act obligates every owner or handler of hazardous substances to procure an insurance policy covering their liability in respect of potential accidents. In addition, under the amended Public Liability Insurance Rules, employers are required to contribute to the Environmental Relief Fund an amount equivalent to the
