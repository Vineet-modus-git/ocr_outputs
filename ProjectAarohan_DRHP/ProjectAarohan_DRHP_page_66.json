The GoI has implemented two major reforms in Indian tax laws, namely the Goods and Services Tax (\"GST\"), and provisions relating to general anti-avoidance rules (\"GAAR\"). The indirect tax regime in India has undergone a complete overhaul. The indirect taxes on goods and services, such as central excise duty, service tax, central sales tax, state value added tax, surcharge and excise have been replaced by GST with effect from July 1, 2017. The GST regime continues to be subject to amendments and its interpretation by the relevant regulatory authorities is constantly evolving. GAAR became effective from April 1, 2017. The tax consequences of the GAAR provisions being applied to an arrangement may result in, among others, a denial of tax benefit to us and our business. In the absence of any substantial precedents on the subject, the application of these provisions is subjective. If the GAAR provisions are made applicable to us, it may have an adverse tax impact on us. Further, if the tax costs associated with certain of our transactions are greater than anticipated because of a particular tax risk materializing on account of new tax regulations and policies, it could affect our profitability from such transactions. The Union Finance Minister recently announced the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (\"IT Bill\") on February 13, 2025, which seeks to simplify the language and restructuring of provisions of the existing Income Tax Act, 1961 (\"Income Tax Act\").

Any increase in inflation in India can increase our expenses, which we may not be able to adequately pass on to our customers, whether entirely or in part, and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In particular, we might not be able to reduce our costs or increase the price of our products to pass the increase in costs on to our customers.
