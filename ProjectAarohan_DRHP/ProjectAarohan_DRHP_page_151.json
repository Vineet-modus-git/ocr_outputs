India's population has been experiencing consistent growth over the years. As of CY2025, India has officially surpassed China to become the most populous country in the world, with an estimated population of 1.45 billion. Projections indicate that this upward trend will continue, with the population expected to reach approximately 1.50 billion by CY2029. The country's median age was 28.4 years in CY2024, well below the US at 38.3 years and China at 39.6 years. This combination of a young, working age population sets India up for a unique demographic dividend and long-term economic potential among large economies. Moreover, India's youthful workforce is also shaping consumer spending preferences towards convenience and modern retail."}, {"bbox": [144, 1185, 845, 1222], "category": "Caption", "text": "Exhibit 1.5: Median Age of Key Economies (CY2024) (in Yrs.)"}, {"bbox": [442, 1256, 1306, 1539], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [144, 1582, 603, 1614], "category": "Text", "text": "Source: World Population Review, United Nations"}, {"bbox": [144, 1636, 697, 1673], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Accelerating Urbanisation and Nuclearisation"}, {"bbox": [142, 1696, 1558, 1924], "category": "Text", "text": "Urbanisation is emerging as a key driver of India's growth, with urban areas functioning as engines of consumption and economic activity.

This share is projected to rise to 40.9% by CY2030, with India housing ~11% of the world's urban population. Parallel to this, India is witnessing a steady shift toward nuclear families, with average household size declining from 5.3 in FY2001 to 4.38 in FY2025 and expected to fall further to 3.9 by FY2030. Such rise in nuclearization is going to drive higher demand for independent housing units and discretionary products."}]
