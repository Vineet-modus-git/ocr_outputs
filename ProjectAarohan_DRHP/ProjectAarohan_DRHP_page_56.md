36. We have incurred indebtedness and an inability to obtain further financing or to comply with repayment and other covenants in our financing agreements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We have entered into various financing arrangements with various lenders for short-term and long-term facilities. The table below sets forth certain information of our borrowings and interest on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost on borrowing from banks, as of and for the period/years as indicated:

<table><thead><tr><th>Particulars</th><th>As at/ for the three months period ended June 30, 2025</th><th>As at/ for the year ended March 31, 2025</th><th>As at/ for the year ended March 31, 2024</th><th>As at/ for the year ended March 31, 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Current Borrowings (₹ million)</td><td>51.87</td><td>61.49</td><td>134.62</td><td>1,309.33</td></tr><tr><td>Non-current Borrowings (₹ million)</td><td>24.56</td><td>36.48</td><td>97.54</td><td>231.68</td></tr><tr><td>Interest on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost - borrowings from banks (₹ million)</td><td>2.35</td><td>18.44</td><td>42.40</td><td>120.00</td></tr></tbody></table>

Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt. Any additional indebtedness we incur may have consequences, including, requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including capital expenditure and reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, competition pressures and market conditions.

Our financing arrangement include conditions that require us to obtain respective lenders' consent prior to carrying out certain activities and entering into certain transactions including but not limited to undertaking the Offer (and subsequently accessing the capital markets in connection thereto) and shareholding pattern of our Company), reduction, sale or dilution in the shareholding of the promoters and promoter group, and/or other existing shareholders of our Company, change in control/ ownership, changes in beneficial ownership, management, management control, if any, changes and amendments in constitution/ charter documents including memorandum of association and articles of association, changes to the management and composition of the board of directors undertaking any new project, modernisation, diversification or substantial expansion of any project, including but not limited to undertaking any further capital expenditure, opening of bank account in connection with the Offer with the bank at the sole discretion of our Company and deposit of the Offer in such account, and delegation of the relevant powers of the board of directors to its committees or sub-committees. Failure to meet these conditions or obtain these consents could have significant consequences on our business and operations. While there has been no breach of such covenants or delay or defaults towards our payment obligations in the last three Fiscals and the three months period ended June 30, 2025, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these financial or other covenants at all times or that we will be able to obtain the consent necessary to take the actions that we believe are required to operate and grow our business. Further, there has been no re-scheduling/ re-structuring in relation to borrowings availed by us from any financial institutions or banks in the last three Fiscals and the three months period ended June 30, 2025. As of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we have received all consents required from our lenders in connection with the Offer.
