in crude oil, freight, or forex has limited long-term impact, with sales and profitability largely sustained even in price-sensitive markets like India.

**Environmental Impact and Disposal Constraints:** PU foam is not biodegradable and lacks a well-developed post-consumer recycling ecosystem in India. Most foam waste is either landfilled or incinerated, which raises sustainability concerns. Although research into recyclable and bio-based variants is underway, large-scale commercial deployment remains limited. Regulatory pressure and increasing customer scrutiny on end-of-life waste handling may translate into future compliance requirements or reputational risks for manufacturers.

**Manufacturing Complexity:** Establishing PU foam manufacturing facilities requires significant capital investment, specialised machinery, and tight process controls, particularly for continuous slab-stock lines and moulded foam operations. In India, the challenge is compounded by heavy dependence on imported feedstocks such as TDI and polyols, which limits backward integration opportunities. As a result, the market is characterised by a few organised, large-scale players (e.g., Sheela Foam, Duroflex, Tirupati Foam). This structural barrier restricts the entry of new large players and contributes to a relatively consolidated competitive landscape in branded slab-stock PU foam.

# Mattress Market in India

## Market Evolution of Mattresses in India

The Indian mattress market has evolved significantly from a fragmented, traditional sector dominated by cotton and coir mattresses to a dynamic, innovation-driven industry with diverse product offerings. During 1960s and 1970s, the industry was largely unbranded with small scale manufacturers producing cotton and coir mattresses. These products were affordable and durable but offered limited comfort and lacked standardisation. It was during this period that Duroflex, one of the first branded mattress players to emerge in the 1960s, along with Kurlon, introduced rubberized coir technology, an innovation that helped standardize the mattress industry. Mattresses were primarily sold through small retail outlets and local distributors. However, adoption remained low, with only around 2% of the population using mattresses. By 1980s, rubberized coir mattresses dominated the modern mattress industry accounting for ~80% of the market, with PU foam mattresses entering the segment gradually. Following economic liberalisation in the 1990s, several foreign players such as Sealy and Dupont entered the Indian market, introducing advanced materials and technologies. However, despite being technically advanced, these global brands were unable to scale substantially in India as they could not build strong distribution networks or offer diversified product portfolios like leading domestic players such as Duroflex and Sheela Foam.

The 2000s witnessed rapid growth in the mattress industry, marked by the entry of several new players and the adoption of modern materials such as memory foam, latex, and spring. This period also marked a significant rise in the branded segment of the market with branded players such as Duroflex, Sheela Foam and others scaling operations, enhancing product quality and introducing premium product lines for affluent urban consumers. From 2010 onwards, the mattress market began shifting towards premiumization, driven by growing urbanization and rising disposable incomes, which fueled consumer demand for greater comfort and durability. As a result, innovation accelerated with the development of hybrid mattresses, that combine foam, latex, and springs for better ergonomics, pressure relief, and durability. Leading players such as Duroflex, which had in-house manufacturing from the beginning of their journey, also worked continuously to enhance their manufacturing capabilities.

Post 2015, the Indian mattress industry witnessed a shift in channel dynamics with the rapid growth of e-commerce and digital-first platforms. This period marked the emergence of direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands such as Wakefit, Sleepyhead, SleepyCat, and The Sleep Company, which adopted online-first strategies and offered customized, value-driven mattresses tailored to evolving consumer preferences. Duroflex was the first established brand in the mattress and furniture industry launch an online D2C brand to specifically target mattresses for the online distribution channel, launching Sleepyhead brand in 2017. Currently, the Indian modern mattress industry is characterized by a strong presence of branded players, catering to a wide spectrum of consumers across price and comfort segments.
