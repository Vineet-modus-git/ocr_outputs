## Raw Materials and Procurement

Our primary raw materials for branded foam and mattress production include chemicals, in particular petrochemicals such as toluene diisocyanate and polyol to produce foam, in addition to springs, natural latex, fabric and glue. Our adjacent products also require natural and processed wood, fabrics, glue, and metal goods. Our procurement team sources these materials from India and outside India, focusing on cost, quality standards, inventory management, and supply stability. We have in the past sourced machinery from Germany and Norway. We monitor market trends, geopolitical scenarios, shipping costs, and regulatory changes to adapt sourcing strategies. We use real-time global price and trend tools for informed decision-making.

We procure raw materials primarily through purchase orders based on our ongoing production needs. We have fostered close relationships with our suppliers to ensure a reliable supply of key raw materials. The availability of multiple suppliers for our key raw materials allows us to readily identify alternative sources.

## Key Manufacturing Processes

We are dedicated to delivering quality products to our customers. To achieve this, we utilize advanced automation technologies in our foam, mattress and furniture manufacturing processes, ensuring production agility, precision, and minimal wastage.

### Branded Foam

Our branded foam manufacturing process, either for direct sales of branded foam or as an intermediate step to mattress manufacturing, has multiple stages, including foam manufacturing, curing, and cutting.

Details of the key steps of the mattress manufacturing process are as follows:

**Foam manufacturing** - The foam manufacturing process utilizes multiple chemicals with specific formulations, including toluene diisocyanate and methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. We operate international foaming machines that we have imported from suppliers in Germany and Norway.

**Curing and Conditioning**- Foam blocks undergo a 24 to 48-hour curing process, during which temperature is closely monitored to prevent fire hazards. A modular safety system, including extinguishers and temperature-sensing mechanisms, is in place to enhance operational security. After curing, foam blocks are conditioned for an additional 48 hours before cutting, to promote molecular bonding.

**Cutting** - Foam blocks are trimmed and sliced using specialized machinery.

### Mattress Manufacturing

Once the branded foam manufacturing process has concluded, the mattress manufacturing process involves several additional steps including gluing, stitching, and roll-packing, supported by safety systems to ensure operational reliability.

Details of the key steps of the mattress manufacturing process are as follows:

**Gluing** - Foam layers are assembled and glued using water-based adhesives. The adhesive used is a water-based glue which is treated with an infrared energy source to ensure bonding at a molecular level, (except in case of spring mattresses) which improves efficiency and reduces costs, when compared to hot melt glue.

**Customization** - Custom mattress orders are further trimmed and finalized during this stage to meet specific customer requirements.

**Packing** – Stitched inner liner and outer covers are applied to the mattress before packing (either flat or roll packing, depending on the model).

### Furniture Manufacturing

Our furniture manufacturing process combines advanced technology, craftsmanship, and sustainable practices to deliver quality products. For solid wood, we have capabilities of CNC cutting, neem wood cutting, quilting, planer cutting, band saw and
