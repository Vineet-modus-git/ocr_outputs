Every product is designed with functionality, dimensions, and ergonomics in mind.\n\n*   **Manufacturing:** We operate seven manufacturing facilities, located in three states. Our facilities are equipped with imported machinery and automation technologies, such as robotic arms and roller belts, which streamline the production process and reduce waste. We continuously invest in enhancing our manufacturing capabilities and automation. Our focus is on efficient production processes, quality manufacturing, and technological innovations. We observe high quality standards and good manufacturing practices at our manufacturing facilities. Our facilities have received certifications from Sedex, ISO and BIS (for details, see \" – Our Manufacturing Facilities\"). During Fiscal 2025, our available capacity was 36,036 metric tons of foam, 24,932 metric tons of foam sheets, 1.2 million mattresses, 83 thousand sofa seats. Further, during Fiscal 2025, our utilisation rate was 78.39% for foam, 61.60% for foam sheets, 69.45% for mattresses and 77.10% for sofa sets.\n*   **Supply chain and logistics.** Our well-structured supply chain network includes 19 warehouses: one mother warehouse in Hosur (with an area of 2.17 lakh square feet) within the premises of Manufacturing Facility VII and 18 regional depots (ranging from 3,000 to 75,594 square feet), as of June 30, 2025. The mother warehouse serves as the primary inventory repository and main distribution point. Regional depots hold inventory for mattresses, furniture and accessories, and are strategically located to reduce delivery times and logistics costs. Our COCO Stores generally do not hold material inventory, with orders being satisfied by direct delivery from a regional depot.\n\nFurther, we utilize technology-based tools across our business operations, including tools for manufacturing and inventory management, logistics, order management, lead management, customer support and customer relationship management (for further details, please see \"—Business Operations– Information Technology\").\n\nWe have implemented cost optimization initiatives across our foam, furniture and mattress manufacturing processes. We focus on increasing process efficiency, utilization, and reducing returns and wastage.\n\nWe prioritize quality assurance through testing and certifications. We conduct evaluations for strength, stability, and durability on prototypes of each product at our in-house testing labs, as well as third party facilities. We simulate long-term use across predefined cycles and weights to ensure our products meet high standards of performance. We subject each new product to thorough testing, including indentation load deflection testing for firmness and rollator tests to simulate five to ten years of usage to test for durability. Our dedication to these standards ensures that our products are not only durable but also certified for reliability and safety.\n\n**Promoter led company with a strong professional management team**\n\nOur organization is led by third-generation, entrepreneurial promoters, Jacob Joseph George, Mathew Chandy, Mathew George and Mathew Antony Joseph. Our Promoters' leadership and experience has enabled us to grow our product portfolio and develop brands, build a pan-India distribution network, maintain relationships with our distributors and retailers, and expand our manufacturing capabilities, in turn driving our growth in revenue from operations and profit margins. Further, our Promoters have also been instrumental in institutionalizing our culture of integrity, innovation, fairness and collaboration.\n\nOur promoters are complemented by a motivated, professional and experienced leadership team with a combined experience of more than 140 years across 11 industries. The sector-specific experience and expertise of our Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management has contributed significantly to the growth of our Company.\n\nOur Board of Directors support and provide guidance to our management team. Our Board of Directors consists of 8 directors including our Chairman and Managing Director, 3 Whole-time Directors and 4 Independent Directors. Additionally, we have been funded by marquee investors, Lighthouse and Norwest, who continue to guide us on strategic initiatives. The shared vision and value system of this team makes us well placed to execute our future plans and ambitions.\n\n**Our Strategies**\n\n**Continue to invest in innovation in existing product portfolio, as well as expand and grow in furniture and accessories categories**\n\nWe intend to utilise our innovation capabilities to expand our existing product portfolio and develop new ranges of products across our product categories. We have launched innovative products like the Neuma range firmness adjustable mattress, the Wave Plus, which is a remote controlled, adjustable smart bed and the Motorized range of electric powered, multi-functional recliners. In particular, we aim to expand our product portfolio within both our Duroflex and Sleepyhead brands of mattresses. Through our new range of products, we expect to increase our wallet share and repeat orders from existing customers and to also attract new customers, which will help us increase our market share and scale our business."}]
