Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to our reputation. We have obtained term loans and working capital limits from various banks. We monitor rolling the forecast of our liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of our expected cash flows. Our objective is to maintain a balance between cash outflow and inflow. Usually, the excess of funds is invested in fixed deposits and other financial instruments. This is generally carried out in accordance with practice and limits set by us. The limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which we operate. We have a strong focus on liquidity and maintain a robust cash position to ensure adequate cover for responding to potential short-term market dislocation. Cash generated through operating activities remains the primary source for liquidity along with undrawn borrowing facilities and levels of cash and cash equivalents."}, {"bbox": [144, 757, 302, 791], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## Market Risk"}, {"bbox": [144, 817, 1558, 950], "category": "Text", "text": "Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect our income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
