A portion of our workforce is represented by a trade union, Duroflex Employees Union. We have not experienced any material work stoppages due to labour disputes or cessation of work in the three months period ended June 30, 2025, and the last three Fiscals. We also engage contract labour to facilitate our manufacturing operations. As of June 30, 2025, we engaged 1,314 contract labourers.

We prioritize good governance practices, including granting employee stock options ("ESOPs") to our workforce, irrespective of designation. We prioritize the well-being of our workforce through diverse programs and engagement initiatives designed to create a healthy and supportive work environment. 'KinCare' is one such initiative, designed to provide support for employees by ensuring that their parents and dependents receive timely care during emergencies through an appointed agency, thereby offering peace of mind and reinforcing overall employee well-being. These initiatives are aimed at driving employee well-being and fostering a positive workplace culture.

Also, see "Risk Factors - Our business is manpower intensive. Our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, strikes, lockouts, increased wage demands by our employees, or an increase in minimum wages, and if we are unable to engage new employees at commercially attractive terms." on page 47.

## Corporate Social Responsibility

We have constituted a corporate and social responsibility ("CSR") committee of our Board of Directors (the "CSR Committee") and have adopted and implemented a CSR policy pursuant to which we carry out our CSR activities. For further information, see "Our Management – Committees of the Board –Corporate Social Responsibility Committee" on page 254.

## Strategic Collaboration: One of India's Olympic athlete training facilities

We had entered into a strategic partnership with one of India's Olympic athlete training facilities to enhance the performance recovery of Indian-Olympic level athletes through scientifically designed sleep solutions. Under this initiative, we supplied performance-grade mattresses from our flagship "Duropedic" and "Energise" ranges as high-performance sleep solutions for the Olympic-level athletes. These products integrate advanced sleep technology aimed at improving sleep duration and quality, supporting muscle recovery, and reducing injury risk.

## Environmental & Sustainability Initiatives

We integrate sustainability across our business, in sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing, logistics and the design of our products with the goal of lowering the environmental impact of our business and enhancing long-term resilience. Where possible, we use eco-friendly materials like reclaimed wood, recycled metals, and natural fibres in our product manufacturing; for example, we make some of our foam with bio-polyols which are sourced from vegetable oils instead of petrochemicals which not only reduce demand for fossil fuels but offer lower emissions of volatile organic compounds and improved biodegradability. Our manufacturing operations use primarily electric forklifts and we seek to optimize our electricity, water and fossil fuel use wherever possible. We have also adopted a waste-reducing manufacturing and recyclable packaging to align with ESG standards and consumer demand for sustainability.
