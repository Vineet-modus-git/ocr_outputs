We may not be able to compete successfully against some of our current or future competitors that have larger distribution networks, especially if such competitors provide their distributors with more favourable arrangements than us. If the terms offered by our competitors to such distributors are more favourable than those offered by us, such distributors may decline to distribute our products and terminate their arrangements with us.

Technical issues in relation to our own and third party ecommerce channels, such as server downtime, software bugs, or inadequate website performance can hinder customer access and transactions, leading to potential loss of revenues. For instance, server downtime can prevent customers from accessing ecommerce channels, resulting in missed sales opportunities and potential loss of customer trust. Software bugs can disrupt the functionality of ecommerce channels, causing frustration for customers and potentially driving them to competitors. Inadequate website performance, such as slow loading times or poor user interface design, can negatively impact the customer experience, reducing the likelihood of repeat purchases. Shifts in customer behaviour, such as changes in online shopping preferences or reduced trust in ecommerce, could negatively impact our online sales. Additionally, our website is managed by a dedicated in-house team. Any loss of manpower within this team could adversely affect our website operations, which could lead to a decline in customer satisfaction. Our website is also prone to cyber-attacks, including data breaches and hacking attempts, which pose significant risks to the security and integrity of our online platform. Data breaches can result in unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, leading to financial losses, legal liabilities, and damage to our reputation.

The expansion of our business may require that we establish COCO Stores and manage businesses in widely disparate states with different statutory, legal and regulatory framework. Compliance with multiple regulatory regimes and management of operations across diverse jurisdictions may increase operational complexity and costs, and any failure to manage these requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, we may be affected by various factors inherent in carrying out business operations in several states in India, such as coordinating and managing operations in several locations, including different political, economic and business conditions and labour laws and associated uncertainties, exposure to different legal standards and regulations; and difficulties in staffing and managing operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
