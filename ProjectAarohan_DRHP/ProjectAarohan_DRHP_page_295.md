## 2 Material accounting policies (continued)

### xv) Income Tax

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

#### a. Current Tax

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period/year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.

#### b. Deferred Tax

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity.

Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

MAT payable for a period/year is charged to the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as current tax. The Group recognizes MAT credit available as an asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the year in which the Group recognizes MAT credit as an asset in accordance with the Guidance Note on Accounting for Credit Available in respect of Minimum Alternative Tax under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the said asset is created by way of credit to the Restated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and shown as 'MAT Credit Entitlement' under Deferred Tax. The Group reviews the same at each reporting date and writes down the asset to the extent the Group does not have convincing evidence that it will pay normal tax during the specified period.

### **xvi) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets**
**Provisions (other than employee benefits)**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Expected future operating losses are not provided for.

Provisions for onerous contracts, i.e., contracts where the expected unavoidable costs of meeting obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received, are recognized when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle a present obligation as a result of an obligating event, based on a reliable estimate of such obligation.

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.

Where the Group expects some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision will be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the Group settles the obligation. The reimbursement is treated as a separate asset.

**Contingent liabilities**

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The contingent liability is not recognized in the books of accounts but its existence is disclosed in the Restated Consolidated Financial Information.

**Contingent assets**

Contingent asset is not recognised in Restated Consolidated Financial Information since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognized.

Provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets are reviewed at each reporting date.

### xvii) Warranty

The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failures. The timing of outflows will vary as and when warranty claim will arise, being typically between 3 to 8 years.
