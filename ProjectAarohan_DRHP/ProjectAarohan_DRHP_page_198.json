According to the TKC Report, our general trade channel is the second broadest distribution network in the Indian sleep and comfort solutions industry as of March 31, 2025. We have developed and maintained longstanding relationships with our distributors and retailers. We regularly interact with our distributors and retailers, including via our general trade order management platform, for insight into customer preferences and market feedback, which in turn helps us to, among others, (i) check for product-market fit at an early stage before scaling them up, and (ii) structure appropriate pricing discounts and advertisement campaigns during festive seasons."}]
